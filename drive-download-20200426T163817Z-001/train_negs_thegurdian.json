The study contained repeated qualifications that its modelling could not be relied upon for a period longer than 12 months., One bureaucrat detailed “not small or irrelevant errors” in that study, including that it overstated the amount of rainfall recharge to groundwater “by a factor of almost 20”. The public servant, whose name is redacted from the document, calculated an annual recharge of 40m litres – less than half the Cherrabah allocation., Another public servant, the principal natural resource officer for groundwater, wrote that he had concerns about Joyful View, which at the time had wanted the allocation to support plans for a massive resort development. He raised concerns the company might seek to exert political pressure to gain the permit., “In October 2008 I wrote to the company and set out, amongst other things, the range of information that would be required to support consideration for an application for an increased water entitlement,” the public servant said., “I have continually referenced the need for caution in the development and use of groundwater from the type of aquifer systems existing on Cherrabah. Risks associated with limited storage, limited recharge potential, boundary conditions under pumping, bore interference etc have been raised time and time again., “Cherrabah management and owners … have little understanding of groundwater. Unfortunately they maintain a simple approach that wet bores are just that and they need not concern themselves about issues of sustainability.”, In another email, the manager writes: “Every opportunity has been taken to urge them to be more cautious and pessimistic rather than the apparent exuberant optimism they hold regarding water supply availability., “I will certainly be looking for counsel in this case as name redacted might call in political support for his multi-million development proposal at Cherrabah if it hangs off an entitlement decision., “I can imagine a debacle if we approve … and their underpinning source of water supply fails.”, The department decided in 2010 to grant Joyful View a short-term permit of 50m litres a year – a quarter of the amount it wanted – and intended to undertake “detailed monitoring and assessment” of the borefield in order to reassess the situation when the licence expired in 2017., Joyful View appealed that decision and in 2012 was granted 96m litres a year on the basis of advice by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority., The Newman government’s changes to the Water Act meant the allocation was effectively made permanent with no review of monitoring data, and no additional study to assess drawdown effects., The way Joyful View gained approval to mine water – amid sustainability concerns and with relatively little scrutiny of the impact on groundwater – has further raised concern about the extent to which other extraction operations, particularly irrigators and pastoralists, might be operating in a manner that is compounding the effects of the drought., The Southern Downs deputy mayor, Jo McNally, told a recent meeting the council was aware of many property owners extracting water and selling it outside the region, but could do nothing to stop it., A 2018 Queensland background paper on groundwater in the Upper Condamine area shows about 9bn litres a year allocated in the Warwick area, but the actual groundwater take is unknown, because bores for stock and domestic use do not require authorisation., There are more than 900 irrigators in the Condamine Balonne underground water management area and many pump unrestricted, without meters. Earlier this year state proposals to place meters on bores and restrict groundwater pumping were met with significant resistance by farmers., Licences also come with no restrictions on how the water is used. Joyful View had wanted to use its water to support a resort development the size of a small town. Its current plan – to truck water to a Gold Coast bottling plant – requires no additional state approval., Members of the Southern Downs regional council, which approved the facility this month, a day before placing residents on extreme water restrictions, have said they have no control over the water or its use, and do not have grounds to refuse a development on that basis., Attempts were made to contact Joyful View for comment.queensland government was warned about risks of chinese companys water extraction", "label": 0}, "train-1": {"text": "\n'It's so moving': Fishlake residents cope together after flood chaos\n, A Yorkshire village’s sense of community remains unbroken amid damaged homes, insurance battles and debris, \nAmy Walker, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 07.59 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Jan 2020 13.30 EST\n\n, Until November, Fishlake, a small and sleepy Doncaster village with only a couple of cafes, a pub and a church at its heart, was little known to most outside the area., But after heavy rainfall brought parts of northern England and the Midlands to a standstill, it became the centre of a media frenzy. Approximately 140 of about 200 homes in the village were swamped in sewage-contaminated floodwater after the River Don burst its banks., “It’s hard to describe just how serious it was, it’s a miracle nobody was killed,” said Peter Pridham, a churchwarden at St Cuthbert’s, which has acted as a storage hub for vast amounts of food, clothing, toys and cleaning products donated to residents since 8 November. “What came through the village started as a flood and turned into a sort of miniature tsunami as a large volume of water broke through.”, On a bone-chilling Wednesday in mid-December, a day after the final main road into the village had been reopened, only the mud, debris, and skips brimming with ruined furniture lining Fishlake’s roads remained as obvious evidence of the deluge. But, for residents, the chaos continued., Many of those whose homes were severely damaged are still in temporary accommodation outside the South Yorkshire village, while a number have taken to living in caravans on their own driveways, including Joanne Ambler, a mental health nurse, and Chris Dewrow, a builder, both 54., “Sorry about the smell,” said Ambler, leading the way through the couple’s scarred bungalow on Grove Road, a cul-de-sac that has been particularly devastated. “We’ve lost everything. Last week we went out, and I hadn’t even got makeup – it’s things like that that remind you.”, The past month has been particularly difficult for the couple, as Ambler’s father died a fortnight before the flood. “I haven’t even had time to grieve for him because it’s all happened at once,” said Ambler, who will return to work in January after taking time off to come to terms with the situation., In the living room, where a dehumidifier constantly whirred, a knee-height line where the water reached was still visible on contaminated blinds. But the couple, who are sharing their motorised home with their two pet dogs, will have to wait for the go-ahead from their insurance company before reparation works – which are likely to take months – can begin., Residents who are either not covered for flood damage on home insurance, or are yet to receive payouts, have so far been eligible for two recovery grants to help with immediate needs – £500 from Doncaster council, and £200 from a local charity, South Yorkshire’s Community Foundation., A few doors down, a retired couple, Mary and Craig Elliot, were packing the last boxes of their salvageable possessions to store at a friend’s home after visiting the church to stock up on tins of food. They have been living between relatives and their caravan in Scarborough since the floodwater rose up to the windowsills in their bungalow., Craig is scathing of the help they received from authorities, claiming it had been “too little too late”. He added: “We asked the council for sandbags and they brought three for the street. Once we’d flooded, they sent the army in. I’m not knocking the army lads because they’re doing what they’re sent to do, but they said, ‘Do you want sandbagging?’ and I said, ‘What, to keep it in?’”, The interior walls of the bungalow, which are shrouded in black mould from the damp, will need to be stripped back to bare bricks before refurbishment can start, but a month on, the Elliots were also waiting to find out how much damage their home insurance would cover., In the absence of so many residents, Fishlake’s pub, the Hare and Hounds, was deserted at lunchtime. In the fortnight after the flood, it offered refuge for affected residents and their pet dogs. Although Doncaster council will pay for mud-stained carpets and upholstered seats to be replaced, its owners, Angie and Scott Godfrey, are still feeling the strain., The Old Butchers cafe, co-owned by Claire Holling, has also made financial losses, on account of its staff spending three weeks largely cooking free food – including curries donated by a Muslim charity based outside Doncaster – for residents and rescue workers. “We haven’t been getting any income. It’s had a massive impact on our business and it’s going to take a while to recover,” said Holling., Still, she added, from the start of the flood, putting the village first had been a given. “There’s always been a strong sense of community in Fishlake with it being such a small place, but it’s definitely got stronger,” said Holling., There is clear evidence for her assertion. On Christmas Day, despite their own woes, the Hare and Hounds laid on a free dinner for 41 people unable to cook at home., Lives have been blighted by last month’s events and ensuing battles to restore homes in Fishlake, but for residents such as Ambler, the sense they were not alone has ensured they remain unbroken. “We’ve spoken to more people since the flood than we have in the 15 months we’ve been living here,” she added. “When you see the amount of help that has been given, it’s so moving it makes you want to cry.”residents work together after chaos of fishlake flooding", "label": 0}, "train-2": {"text": "\nCanberra experiences worst air quality on record as bushfire smoke from south coast sets in\n, Residents of Australia’s capital are told to stay indoors and brace for more smog in the coming days, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 03.49 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Wed 1 Jan 2020 01.52 EST\n\n, Canberra has experienced its worst air quality on record, as bushfire smoke became trapped by atmospheric conditions and residents were told to stay indoors and brace for more smog in the coming days., The ACT’s acting chief health officer, Dr Paul Dugdale, said the smoke was the worst since the 2003 bushfires and was “certainly the worst” since air quality monitoring started in the city 15 years ago., Air quality index readings in Canberra city were at 3,463 on Wednesday afternoon, according to the ACT Health website. Ratings of more than 200 are considered hazardous. The suburb of Monash showed levels at 4,650 and Florey was at 3,508., An ACT health spokesperson said the AQI reading for fine particles peaked at 7700 at 1am on Wednesday at the Monash monitoring site., The Canberra-based University of NSW climate scientist Dr Sophie Lewis was out in the city with her two-year-old daughter and said the conditions were “like nothing I have experienced before”. She was planning to leave the city., “It’s permeating everything. It is the fine particulates that get through everything. This is the worst it has been,” she said., “Last night it started to blow in and you do start to feel quite anxious and stressed.

This cut in sulphur content has been more than a decade in the planning, and almost all shipping around the world is expected to comply, or face penalties., “Member states, the shipping industry and fuel oil suppliers have been working for the past three years to prepare for this major change – I am confident that the benefits will soon be felt and that implementation will be smooth,” said Kitack Lim, the secretary general of the IMO. “This is a hugely important change which will have significant positive benefits for human health and the environment.”, The new regulations are aimed at cleaning up sulphur emissions, which can cause acid rain and other forms of air pollution, rather than tackling the climate emergency. However, the dirty forms of fuel that contain high levels of sulphur are usually higher carbon too, and the costs of cleaning up sulphur may spur shipping companies to become more efficient in their fuel use, which would cut greenhouse gas emissions directly., Moving to cleaner fuels could add substantially to costs, from an estimated $400 (£303) a tonne for fuel oil today to as much as $600 a tonne, according to the International Chamber of Shipping. Higher shipping costs may be absorbed throughout the manufacturing and transport supply chains., The cost impact may also spread beyond shipping, according to the energy analyst firm Wood Mackenzie. “Knock-on effects from the cap on sulphur emissions in marine bunker fuel could even wind up giving you a more expensive plane ticket in 2020,” the company said., The IMO estimates that the new limit – of 0.5% sulphur content compared with the previous limit of 3.5%, enforced under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships – will cut sulphur oxide emissions from ships by 77%, an annual reduction of about 8.5m tonnes., Fuel oil for shipping has long been one of the dirtiest forms of fossil fuel, made up of the sort of low-value and cheap crude oil that is unsuitable or expensive to refine into high-grade products such as petrol for cars, or kerosene for planes. Ship engines have been designed to cope with such low-grade fuel, and the emissions they belch out as a result mostly happen far from land, making the accompanying pollution less visible and, for many decades, largely ignored by governments., But the damaging effects of the pollution have grown as globalisation has led to a massive increase in shipping transport. Shipping consumed about 3.8m tonnes of fuel oil a day in 2017, according to Wood Mackenzie, equivalent to half of global fuel oil demand. Carbon from shipping makes up about 3% of global total carbon emissions, but is expected to rise to 17% by mid-century. Fuel oil with a high sulphur content produces sulphur oxides, which can cause acid rain and particulate pollution., Alternatives to low-grade, high-sulphur fuel oil are increasingly available, albeit at a higher price. Liquefied natural gas is still a fossil fuel, but much cleaner, and infrastructure allowing its use is becoming more widespread. Biofuels are also being explored as an alternative – one enterprising cruise company is using fish guts for its fuel – and there are high hopes for harnessing hydrogen fuels in the form of ammonia for ship engines., Vessels can also be fitted with “scrubbers” to remove sulphur, though some of this is then released into the sea as effluent. Ports have also become increasingly concerned at the pollutants from cargo and passenger ships, and some operate zones where sulphur content is even more drastically reduced., Shipping is subject to complex international regulation, overseen by the IMO, the London-based UN body. However, for historic reasons, it has been excluded from calculations of international greenhouse gas emissions, and thus exempted from governments’ obligations under UN climate agreements, including the landmark Paris accord of 2015., That has meant shipping companies have felt less pressure to cut carbon, and progress on all forms of shipping pollution has been slow and often tortuous. The new sulphur regulations were first enacted by the IMO in 2008, after years of debate, but had to be re-confirmed in 2016 before finally coming into force on Wednesday., Climate change campaigners want to see much faster adoption of regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions from shipping. The next major public meeting will be an IMO conference in London in late March and early April, where countries will come under pressure to lay out a clear plan on cutting carbon from the sector, ahead of a major UN climate conference in Glasgow in November., The IMO has a longterm aim to halve carbon from shipping by 2050, but few concrete plans to achieve it. An increasing number of countries, including the UK, are aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2050, in line with scientific warnings on the urgency of the climate emergency., The ICS has also proposed a $2 a tonne levy on shipping fuels that would pay into a fund for research and development on zero-carbon forms of shipping, which will be explained to member states at the spring IMO conference, but could take years to come into force.shipping fuel regulation to cut sulphur levels comes into force", "label": 0}, "train-5": {"text": "\nCountry diary: nuthatches continue their northerly advance\n, Backstone Bank Wood, Weardale: The common sight of this once rare bird is a welcome reversal of the trend of decline, \nPhil Gates, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, In the dying minutes of winter’s shortest days, something magical happens to the trees that cling to the steep slope on the eastern edge of Tunstall reservoir. Just before the setting sun dips behind Wolsingham Park Moor, the water surface becomes a mirror that bounces glancing sunbeams into the tree canopy. Seen from across the reservoir, trunks and branches are bathed in a golden glow, every twig etched with startling clarity against the gathering dusk within the wood., This afternoon, as I walked among those trees, the lighting was pure theatre. My vision struggled to accommodate its extremes, of dazzling white trunks of silver birch, rough-textured grey bark of ancient oaks, vivid green mosses and deep black shadows., A nuthatch appeared as a fleeting monochrome silhouette, hanging on the shadowy underside of a branch, dagger beak wheedling out something from a fissure. It vanished behind the trunk, then reappeared in bright sunlight, in full colour, unmistakable in its bandit-mask black eye-stripe, slate-blue back, and apricot chest feathers., Just another nuthatch. But when I first came to live hereabouts, more than 40 years ago, these were rare birds in County Durham. Reading through my natural history notebooks from the 1970s I see that they merited a specific mention on the few occasions when I saw one. Now they are common., Their relentless northerly advance is often attributed to milder winters, brought about by climate change, though it’s far from clear exactly what factors have changed in their favour. It would now be noteworthy to walk in deciduous woodlands in Weardale and not see – or, more often, hear – these birds; they have a piercing call, especially in late winter and early spring when courtship begins., Personal nature notebooks, often ledgers of profit and loss, can be emotive documents, with the growing awareness of shifting baseline syndrome, where succeeding generations are denied the pleasure of seeing once-commonplace species that disappear during their parents’ lifetime. In the 1970s I recorded red squirrels here; I would now need to travel much further afield to see one. But in the case of the nuthatch, in this precious fragment of ancient woodland, the syndrome seems to have worked in reverse.country diary nuthatches continue their northerly advance", "label": 0}, "train-6": {"text": "\nThe hidden environmental cost of your free holiday returns\n, Millions of Americans make free online returns each year, contributing to greenhouse-gas emissions – and many items end up in landfills, \nDanielle Renwick, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 17.48 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 2 Jan 2020 06.00 EST\n\n, Millions of Americans will head to the post office this month, unwanted holiday gifts in hand. But while it may be convenient to return that ugly sweater from your mom, that ease comes at a huge cost to the environment., The United Parcel Service (UPS) predicts that it will process a record 1.9 million returns on 2 January, which it has dubbed National Returns Day. More than half (55%) of Americans said they planned on returning unwanted holiday gifts within a month of receiving them, according to a survey published by the National Retail Federation., The spike in returns is largely the result of more Americans doing their holiday shopping online: e-commerce sales were up 19% over last year, according to Mastercard. Amazon, the country’s largest online retailer, saw its stock rise last week after the company reported a “record-breaking” holiday season., However, what many shoppers may not know is that shipping returned goods contributes to greenhouse-gas emissions – and much of what they send back ends up in landfills. Each year Americans return about 3.5 billion products, and five billion pounds of returned goods ended up in US landfills, according to Optoro, a technology company that helps retailers process returns., “Our data shows that 88% of consumers think that returns go right back on the shelf and are resold to the next consumer,” says Ann Starodaj, head of sustainability at Optoro. “But in reality, the majority of returned items cannot be resold as new.”, The company says the landfill waste from returns alone contributes 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere., Clothing sales have a particularly high return rate, between 40 and 50%. That’s because, as one market research firm puts it, “the bedroom is the new fitting room”., “The easier you make it for the customer to return something, the more likely it is that the customer thinks there’s no cost to the return,” says Miguel Jaller, co-director of the Sustainable Freight Research Center at University of California, Davis. In fact, he says, “There are untold externalities in terms of packaging and resources, just to move the things we don’t like to another home or discarding facility or to another country.”, Companies opt not to return goods to the market for several reasons. In some cases, returned goods have been damaged or are no longer in season – for example, a winter coat returned in July. Often the value of the product is so low that it’s simply cheaper to throw it away than to handle the logistics of resale. Sellers sometimes have contracts with suppliers that prohibit them from selling an item more than once., Jaller has found that consumers are more than twice as likely to return items bought online than in a store. And returns made in stores typically have less of an environmental impact than those made to e-retailers. “With e-retailers, there’s no store to drive to. A person drives to UPS, the product is then shipped to a warehouse. That return requires several different movements, whereas with a traditional retailer that product will likely stay at the store,” he says. Jaller estimates that between 20 and 25% of e-retailers’ environmental externalities are due to returns., There are steps governments, retailers, and consumers can take to reduce waste., Cities and states can impose tolls or congestion pricing on delivery trucks, while local law enforcement can restrict where and for how long trucks are allowed to idle while making deliveries. Earlier this year, the French government banned the destruction of unused consumer goods., Retailers can minimize packaging, offer clearer descriptions of products, and use energy-efficient warehouses, among other things. They can also increase the number of dropoff sites, like Amazon lockers, that can streamline the returns process. Some companies, like Ikea, are using virtual reality to help customers envision their products in their homes; many clothing brands use TrueFit technology to help consumers more accurately choose their size., More sellers could also charge for returns, but experts say that is unlikely in the short term as companies compete for market share. “According to our research, 97% of consumers say that a positive returns experience will encourage them to shop at that retailer again,” wrote Starodaj. “Amazon understands that owning and excelling at the returns moment is critical to their customer satisfaction.”, Jaller says that means much of the responsibility for reducing waste will fall to the consumer. He suggests fundamentally rethinking what we purchase in the first place, adding: “If you’re not sure you need it, don’t buy it.”as americans send back millions of holiday gifts theres a hidden environmental cost", "label": 0}, "train-7": {"text": "\nWant to lose weight?

There are all sorts of social barriers to us adapting to climate change., “Some are purely the psychological make-up of people that don’t want to acknowledge a problem, some of it is a government more interested in elections every three years, and some is the vested interests of industry that undoubtedly confuse the issues. They are all barriers., “We are a group of physical scientists and biologists,” Williams says, “but we came up with this reasoning that we need to do some social research., “We’ve had highest temperatures ever, and the longest and most intense heatwaves geographically, and we’ve had floods happening at the same time as the biggest drought, and have seen rainforests burning., “What’s the social resistance against something that is so in your face, yet people still want to stick their heads in the sand and deny it? It is the social barriers that are stopping us and it is incredibly frustrating.”, Adaptation is going to be critical to Australia. Mitigation has to be global, but adaptation can be local, Climate adaptation looks at ways to reduce the impacts of climate change that are unavoidable, and is distinct from mitigation, which focuses on reducing emissions., “Climate change mitigation is about avoiding the unmanageable,” says Dr Alistair Hobday, a research director at CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere and a co-author of the analysis., “Adaptation is about managing the unavoidable. Adaptation is going to be critical to Australia. Mitigation has to be global, but adaptation can be local.”, Hobday says that as well as understanding why some might see climate change as a lower priority, another barrier is public resistance to translocating species that are not able to adapt or move as temperatures and rainfall change., “These are situations where people resist doing something despite the evidence that the animal’s world is changing,” he says., The only example of a project like that in Australia is a pilot study that has moved 35 captive-bred western swamp turtles to new sites in south-west Western Australia., Prof Lesley Hughes, of Macquarie University, and also an author on the analysis, says there has been resistance to “interventions” like translocation, but this needs to change., Despite 30 years of research looking at how climate change would affect habitats, she says, very little work has been done to protect species., Other priorities identified by the analysis are to make environmental and planning laws more proactive, and to improve understanding of the effects of extreme events on ecosystems., NCCARF was launched in 2008 with $47m of federal government funding over five years, and then a further $8.8m to 2017. A final $300,000 of funding ran out in June 2018, and the facility is now vastly scaled-down and operating through Griffith University., Williams says it is “frustrating” that NCCARF has not received continued funding when it has built a foundation of research that could be exploited., “We had got to the stage where in the next five or 10 years we were really going to start to achieve things, and that’s when it got chopped.”what stops scientists", "label": 0}, "train-9": {"text": "\nThe plastic polluters won 2019 – and we're running out of time to stop them\n, \nThe plastic polluters won 2019 – and we're running out of time to stop them\n, Further steps have been taken to clean up beaches and seas in 2019 – but much more needs to be done , \nJohn Vidal, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 07.46 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 17 Jan 2020 13.39 EST\n\n, The beach at Muncar on the island of Java was revolting. The 400-yard wide, mile-long stretch of sand was feet deep in foul-smelling sauce sachets, shopping bags, nappies, bottles and bags, plastic clothes and detergent bottles. Bulldozers had cleared away and buried some of the huge mat of plastic and sand two years ago, but every tide since then had washed up more rubbish from the ocean, and every day tonnes more plastic was washed down the rivers from upstream towns and villages. Now it was fouling the fishing boats’ propellers., “We fear for the future,” one elderly woman said. She remembered Muncar only a decade ago as one of the most picturesque towns in Indonesia and a tourist hotspot. “If it carries on like this we will be buried in plastic. We have no choice but to throw plastic into the rivers. Now we are angry. Something must be done,” she said., That was January 2019. One year later, the beach heaves with plastic but the local government, working with well-funded international advisers, a recycling company and an army of volunteer collectors have worked to stem the tide of plastic reaching its beaches. It will cost millions of dollars and take years but Muncar may soon have its sand back., But this small Indonesian town is the exception. 2019 was, for most of the world, the year the petrochemical industry and giant food, drink and beauty companies locked the world even further into fossil fuels, creating mountains of plastic for communities and future generations to deal with and making it almost too late to keep global temperatures in check., Ultra-cheap shale gas from the decade-long US fracking boom continued to fuel a surge of billion-dollar investments in new cracking plants that separate ethane from gas to produce ethylene, the building block of most plastic. Since 2010 the petrochemical industry has invested about $200bn, and with $100bn more planned to be spent, plastic production is expected to grow 40% by 2030., The implications for countries struggling to cope with climate change and thousands of communities fighting tides of plastic are only now being understood. From having little impact on the climate just 20 years ago, the production and disposal of plastic now uses nearly 14% of all the world’s oil and gas. Plastic production is expected to grow to 20% by 2050 by which time the industry’s climate emissions could rise to 2.75bn tonnes a year and plastic could be driving half of all oil demand growth., Plastic, says the International Energy Agency, could take up to 15% of the remaining annual carbon budget and make the fast-growing industry the equivalent of the world’s fifth largest climate heating country, emitting more than Germany or the UK, twice as much as all African countries and nearly as much as shipping and aviation combined., Even as anger mounted in 2019 against rich countries’ reluctance to act on climate change, it became clear that plastic was big oil’s great hope for expansion, and one of the world’s leading drivers of climate change. Shell’s giant $6bn ethane-cracking plant being built near Pittsburgh, will produce 1.6m tons of plastic a year but is just one of dozens of similar size plants planned for the US, India, China and the Middle East., Despite UN hand-wringing and corporate pledges, demand for plastics grew a further 3.5% in 2019 and up to 16% in much of Asia. Latest figures suggest 359 m tonnes were produced in 2018. Nearly one-third went to single-use packaging and less than 10% was recycled. The rest went to landfills, was burned in incinerators adding to emissions and increasing air pollution, or was left uncollected, with approximately 8m tons making its way to the sea via rivers., But 2019 was also the year the worldwide revolt against plastic pollution translated into political and corporate action; when going plastic-free in Europe became trendy and giant food, drink and health companies were shamed. It was the year governments pledged new laws and when hundreds of potential solutions and initiatives were initiated., Great steps were taken by the public to clean up beaches and seas but in Britain the size of the task was underlined in November when a sperm whale was found on a Scottish beach. An examination of its stomach revealed a 100kg ball of plastic rope, fishing nets, cups, shopping bags, gloves, packing straps, tubing, sachets, bottles and all the waste of the global consumer society. Such beachings were common in 2019, with plastic-filled whales and cetaceans washed up in Wales, the Philippines, Indonesia, Italy and the US., Rattled by public disgust at the sight of choked animals and soiled coastlines, the packaging industry was forced to respond. Food and drink firms including Unilever, Mars, Danone, Pepsico and Coca-Cola pledged to reduce the amount of virgin plastic they used by 2025 and to increase the amount of recycled plastic. The global commitment on plastic, introduced in late 2018 to get corporations to pledge to use less and recycle more, grew to more than 400 of the world’s biggest companies. Together they are responsible for more than 20% of all the plastic packaging produced., The UK supermarkets Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose raced to ditch hard-to-recycle “black” plastic from their ranges and to accelerate the amount of recycled material they use. Asda stated that nearly one-third of its plastic packaging would come from recycled sources by the end of 2020 and all should be recyclable by 2025. Waitrose said it had removed 90% of the 2,291 tonnes of black plastic. Some initiatives were eye-catching: Tesco pledged to remove 1bn pieces of plastic from products for sale in UK stores by the end of 2020., Sir David Attenborough detected a cultural change, telling the Glastonbury crowds that the world was changing its habits on plastic. But he may have been wrong. Greenpeace and the Environment Investigations Agency showed that more plastic than ever was put on shop shelves in 2019 and only Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury’s of the 10 biggest chains marginally reduced the amounts they used. Plastic water bottle sales, indeed, soared., Academic research, too, confirmed that pollution was worse than ever in 2019 and that the fishing industry was considerably responsible. The Dutch Ocean Cleanup project, working in the Great Pacific garbage patch, found more than half came from discarded plastic nets and rope, fish aggregating devices FADs, buoys, long lines, crates and floats. French researchers showed how plastic litter at the bottom of the Mediterranean had tripled since 1990 and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimated that there would be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050 if business was allowed to continue as normal., Wherever researchers looked, they were horrified. One study found an estimated 1.8m pieces of plastic, old tyres and fishing gear on the sea floor of the Bay of Fundy between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in Canada; the WWF calculated that 570,000 tonnes of plastic went into the Mediterranean each year – the equivalent of 33,800 plastic bottles every minute and plastic was found widely in the food chain and in human bodies., Under pressure from governments but unwilling to produce less, the industry turned in 2019 to bioplastics, which convert the sugar present in plants and crop residues into plastic. Big manufacturers such as BASF, Dow, Huhtamaki, Plantic, Mondi, and Amcor ramped up research into plastic from corn, wheat, potatoes, soyabean and cotton. The market is still small but is expected to grow 20% annually into a $70bn a year industry by 2024., But critics said bioplastics were not the answer. Not only can they take up land needed for food production, but most bioplastics need high temperature industrial composting facilities to break them down. With few local authorities able to handle them, the result is most must go to landfills where they are likely to release methane, a greenhouse gas 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide., Industry attempts to appear green mostly ended in confusion. Products were increasingly classed as compostable, biodegradable, recyclable, reusable or bio-based. But most of these terms meant little. Biodegradable plastic was found to be intact after years at sea; not all compostable materials, it was found, could be composted at home; and recyclable depended on the local waste stream; with few standards and no timescale attached to bioplastics, many were described as false solutions., Faced with heavily polluted coastlines, a hostile media and angry tourists, the EU launched its plastics strategy in 2019 . This aims to ensure all plastic packaging is reusable or recyclable by 2030. It also calls for 90% of all plastic bottles to be recycled by 2025. The new UK government has pledged to ban the export of plastic waste to poor countries, and to introduce a tax on plastic packaging with less than 30% of recycled content from 2022. It also said it would stop by April 2020 the use of 4.7bn plastic straws, the 316m plastic stirrers and the 1.8bn plastic cotton buds used each year., Asian countries, faced with massively polluted coastlines and a swiftly growing plastics market, promised to act., India and Peru planned to eliminate all single-use plastic by 2022 and the Maldives said it would phase out all its non-biodegradable plastic. By the end of 2019, more than 120 countries had banned plastic bags and 60 more countries said they would impose taxes. Many US states banned or said they were planning to phase out plastic bags., The industry fought back. Companies may have promised publicly to stop using certain types of plastic, but their trade bodies lobbied strongly in 2019 against new laws and argued to be allowed to continue to produce more. Industry and supermarket trade groups lobbied against proposed deposit return schemes, bans and new recycling targets. The US industry responded with threatening lawsuits against local authorities and cities who tried to introduce bag bans., Instead of waiting for governments and industry, coalitions of global and local NGOs, international banks, conservation groups and some plastic producers volunteered to clean up rivers and beaches, and help governments collect and recycle waste. The UK-based Common Seas NGO worked with islands and resorts in the Maldives and Greece, and with city authorities in Indonesia to prevent plastic getting to the ocean. Volunteers cleared millions of pieces of plastic from beaches in the Mediterranean, Middle East, Latin America, China and India beaches., Novel ways to collect plastic from rivers and oceans were introduced. The Ocean Cleanup project launched the Interceptor, a barge-like vessel theoretically able to harvest up to 100,000kg of plastic waste a day from heavily polluted rivers. Waternet, which manages Amsterdam’s canals, introduced a “bubble barrier” to catch floating debris. New Naval adapted oil-spill technology to invent a mesh barrier system to collect river plastic; and Mr Trash Wheel scooped rubbish out of the Jones Fall River in Baltimore with waterwheels., By the end of 2019, the war between the petrochemical companies and those who would stem their tides of plastic was fully engaged, but was still being largely won by the petrochemical industry., 2020 is widely seen to be critically important. In June the UN will host an oceans conference in Portugal at which worldwide progress will be assessed, and countries will pledge to prevent plastic pollution. Many proposed government bans should also come into force and hundreds of smaller initiatives to recycle more and reduce pollution should start to grow and make a difference., What is certain is that calls for a reduction in plastic use will grow louder and the industry will resist. But unless ways are found to use less, most of the efforts to stem the flood of plastic entering the environment are likely to prove temporary and insufficient., • A version of this article appears at commonseas.comyear plastic pollution clean beaches seas", "label": 0}, "train-10": {"text": "\nAlan Christie obituary\n, Shareen Campbell, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 05.59 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 14 Jan 2020 10.58 EST\n\n, My brother-in-law Alan Christie, who has died aged 68 after suffering from a heart condition, was a proponent of corporate social responsibility and for many years the director of community affairs at Levi’s. He helped to pioneer work that set the tone for the way in which multinational businesses funded efforts to combat Aids., At Levi’s from 1988 to 2004, he expanded the company’s grant funding programme to support early projects to beat Aids and to promote education about Aids/HIV, particularly in southern Africa., Among the initiatives he supported was the Positive Lives project, a photographic portrayal of people affected by Aids that became a global phenomenon and was seen by millions. While at Levi’s he also founded, with the former European commissioner Étienne Davignon, a business network on corporate social responsibility called CSR Europe., Alan was born in St Andrews, Fife, to Alexander, a miner and trade unionist, and his wife, Jane (nee Barclay), who worked in a paper mill. After Kirkcaldy high school he went to Heriot Watt University, where his degree was in town planning but his education was in student politics. In 1977 he was elected Scottish president of the National Union of Students, and for two years from 1978-80 was deputy president of the NUS UK during the presidency of Trevor Phillips., From 1980 until 1983 he was secretary general of the British Youth Council, based in London, then moved to Brussels as secretary general of the Council of European National Youth Committees. There he met my sister, Moya Campbell, who in 2000 became his life partner and in 2008 his wife. In 1988, still in Brussels, he took up the job as director of community affairs at Levi’s and through that work in 1993 met Nelson Mandela, one of the proudest moments of his life., In 2006 he returned to the UK to become a director first at the Commission for Racial Equality and then at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, helping to shape the 2010 Equalities Act and working with businesses to promote human rights., He retired in 2015 and afterwards retained his trusteeship of the Runnymede Trust, the race equality thinktank, and volunteered briefly as a prison monitor before developing a serious heart condition. , A loyal Labour party and Rangers supporter, a devotee of Tunnock’s teacakes, a pretty terrible driver and a consummate player of Trivial Pursuit, to his friends he was a wise adviser., He is survived by Moya and by his sister, Loraine.alan christie obituary", "label": 0}, "train-11": {"text": "\nA warm welcome?

While we may celebrate their arrival now it should also alert us to what’s ahead , \nStephen Moss, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 9 Jan 2020 10.50 EST\n\n, Mediterranean egrets balancing on the backs of cows, multicoloured moths the size of a human hand, and impossibly exotic bee-eaters hawking for insects under English skies. All are here as a direct consequence of the climate crisis, which has allowed continental European species to extend their ranges northwards, and then make the leap across the Channel to gain a foothold in southern Britain., Whenever I take a walk along the disused railway line across the Avalon marshes, near my Somerset home, I can’t help noticing these new arrivals. Tall and elegant, great white egrets first arrived here from France just a few years ago; now I encounter them every time I visit. Down the road, at the Somerset Wildlife Trust’s reserve at Catcott Lows, flocks of cattle egrets – the same species we see in wildlife films from Africa – gather to feed, perched appropriately on the backs of cattle. Elsewhere on the marshes, secretive night herons and little bitterns have also bred in recent years., When I moved to Somerset with my young family just over a dozen years ago, all these species were so rare they would have attracted a crowd of eager twitchers. Today, everyone – including my own teenagers – takes them for granted., Going back to my own childhood, the now ubiquitous little egret – that Persil-white apparition featuring at a wetland near you – was incredibly scarce. When, at the age of 10, I stumbled across one on Brownsea Island in Dorset, it was the highlight of my birding life for many years afterwards., And it’s not just birds. When it comes to unexpected new arrivals, butterfly and moth enthusiasts have enjoyed a bumper year. First came the news in August that an invasion of long-tailed blue butterflies was occurring all the way along the south coast, from Cornwall to Kent. This unusual looking butterfly – which really does have a tiny “tail” protruding from the back of each wing – was turning up in the most unexpected places: Sussex butterfly expert Neil Hulme even found one laying eggs on pea plants in a pub garden. Thanks to Hulme’s guidance, even I managed to catch up with them, in the equally unlikely setting of a patch of waste ground next to Brighton racecourse., Meanwhile, that group of nocturnal activists known as “moth trappers”, of which I am one, have been attracting some real beauties to their light traps. The greatest prize this summer has been the wonderfully named Clifden nonpareil – literally meaning “beyond compare”., One of our largest and most spectacular moths, with a 12cm wingspan and a bright blue flash on its underwings, it was once considered extinct in Britain. Yet this summer, after an absence of many years, the Clifden nonpareil has been turning up in moth traps all over southern England and Wales., Its day-flying counterpart, the hummingbird hawkmoth, has also had a good year, as has one of our most mysterious and sought-after species, the death’s-head hawkmoth., Made famous – or perhaps that should be infamous – by the novel and film The Silence of the Lambs, several death’s-head caterpillars and pupae have been found in potato patches in the Somerset village of Westbury-sub-Mendip., Brought indoors by local naturalists, they were successfully hatched out, the adult moths revealing the sinister skull pattern on the back of the thorax that gives the species its name. When I went to see this extraordinary insect, it emitted its famous “squeak”, which adds to its terrifying reputation., It’s not just these new arrivals that indicate the effects of climate change – or as we now more correctly call it, the climate emergency. Many resident bird species are rising in numbers; as are short-distance migrants such as the blackcap and chiffchaff. These small, neat warblers are now overwintering in Britain (instead of Spain and north Africa), thanks to milder winters, and the consequent wider availability of their insect food., So, in Voltaire’s ironic comment, all is surely for the best, in the best of all possible worlds. For the moment, that may indeed be true. Yet as long ago as 1990, the German ornithologist and migration expert Peter Berthold warned that during the initial warming period many bird species would benefit from “heavenly conditions”. This, he explained, was a kind of honeymoon period in which warmer springs and summers, and milder winters, would allow them to expand their numbers and range., But if the global climate becomes hotter still, with more frequent and extreme weather events such as droughts, storms and floods, reality will inevitably begin to bite, and all but the most adaptable species will start to decline. Their fall might also be hastened by an increase in populations of parasites and diseases, which flourish in warmer climates., Ironically, the long-tailed blue butterfly I watched sunning itself in August cannot survive Britain’s winters – at least not yet. As Neil Hulme explains, it would need a rise in average temperatures of several degrees, enough to banish winter frosts that kill their larvae, to colonise Britain permanently. But if that did happen, we would have reached a climatic tipping point, and probably lose not just much of our wildlife, but even jeopardise our own long-term existence on the planet., Rapid environmental change is likely to hit some creatures harder than others. On a recent edition of the Radio 4 series The Life Scientific, Professor Anne Magurran of St Andrews University talked about what she calls “the shopping mall effect”. She noted that wherever you go in the world nowadays, from London to Los Angeles, Madrid to Melbourne, shopping centres tend to have the same outlets – well-known international brands whose names we all recognise., Likewise, in response to a panoply of environmental pressures, ecosystems are tending to become more homogenous, with a few highly adaptable species beginning to dominate to the exclusion of less successful ones. As Magurran warns, if environmental conditions become more and more extreme, homogenisation will start to occur, and there will inevitably be species loss., However, as Magurran points out, there is still time for us to take action to help safeguard the earth’s biodiversity. At the moment, she says, the dominant signal is change rather than loss. But unless we take swift and decisive action to mitigate climate change, while at the same time preventing habitat destruction, the rate of extinction will start to accelerate. Given that many governments appear to be heading in the opposite direction, with increased deregulation and a weakening of environmental protection back on the agenda, this is a very real concern. If we fail to act, the consequences for Britain’s wildlife are that successful generalists will do well, while specialists will not., When it comes to making predictions, we also need to take into account the unusual nature of the British Isles, which stretch from Shetland, just a few degrees of latitude short of the Arctic Circle, to Scilly, which has its own – almost subtropical – microclimate., So, while we enjoy the short-term benefits of climate change in the south, problems are already beginning to occur at the other end of Britain. On the Cairngorm plateau, our sole example of the arctic-alpine biome, the ptarmigan – the only British bird that turns white in winter – is gradually declining, with just a few thousand pairs remaining., Until the start of the 19th century, the ptarmigan could be found across a wide swathe of northern Britain, south to the Lake District; but today it survives only in the Highlands. Its decline has been caused by a number of factors, including crows attracted by the rubbish left by visitors, which prey on the ptarmigan’s eggs and chicks. But a more long-term factor is the warming climate, which is altering the habitat and food supply of these highly specialised birds., Should the climate emergency continue to worsen, and temperatures keep rising, the ptarmigan – along with other highland specialists such as the dotterel and snow bunting – looks set to disappear as a British bird in my lifetime., I recall many years ago hearing someone talk about saving the planet “for our children, and our children’s children”. At the time, this felt like an abstract notion; even a rather sanctimonious platitude. Now that I have children and step-grandchildren of my own, who may well live to witness the 22nd century, that phrase feels far more relevant and urgent. If the worst predictions for the climate emergency come true, with devastating consequences for human and animal life on this planet, then I do not envy them living that long., So, much as I enjoy seeing cattle egrets on my local patch, or catching up with a new species of butterfly on the south coast, my pleasure is more than ever tinged with concern., My fear is that these pioneering colonists are not something to be celebrated, but a phenomenon to warn us of impending disaster in this new age of extinction., • Stephen Moss is a naturalist and author based in Somerset, where he is president of the Somerset Wildlife Trust; he also runs an MA in travel and nature writing at Bath Spa Universitya warm welcome the wildlife visitors warning of climate disaster aoe", "label": 0}, "train-12": {"text": "\n'The salt they pump back in kills everything': is the cost of Chile's fresh water too high?\n, \n'The salt they pump back in kills everything': is the cost of Chile's fresh water too high?\n, Antofagasta, situated on the edge of the Atacama Desert, relies on a vast desalination plant which provides the city with drinking water – but the waste brine is killing wildlife, say fishermen, \nJohn Bartlett in Antofagasta, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 07.45 EST\n\n, As Eduardo Muñoz drifts his ageing skiff into Antofagasta’s harbour, flecks of paint peeling from its prow, he looks disconsolate., “I used to get twice as many clams from every dive,” he mutters bitterly, hauling two large sacks of shellfish on to the dock and ruffling the salt from his hair., “Since desalination began a few years back I’ve hardly had any luck,” he says. “The salt they pump back into the sea kills everything, and there’s just a thick layer of sludge on the sea bed now.”, The salt they pump back into the sea kills everything, Muñoz lives and dives in La Chimba, a dilapidated seaside suburb of Antofagasta, a city of 360,000 people on Chile’s arid northern plains and the largest settlement in the Atacama Desert – the driest place on Earth., Desalination is a common solution to water scarcity around the world, and is used extensively in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. The UK’s first plant was opened in London in 2010., In 2003, Chile’s first desalination plant began operating in Muñoz’s neighbourhood, pumping 150 litres of drinking water a second towards Antofagasta to relieve the city of its dire need for fresh water., The facility has steadily increased its output, and is now the largest drinking water desalination plant in Latin America, operating at 1,056 litres per second. It provides 82.5% of Antofagasta’s potable water, with the remainder fed by the city’s scarce surface water reserves., Across the region of Antofagasta, accounting for 600,000 people, 56.3% of the drinking water consumed is now desalinised sea water., Finding water in the desert has never been easy., “Across Antofagasta’s history, the struggle for access to water is the one constant,” says 92-year-old historian Floreal Recabarren at a city centre café, rapping his cane impatiently on the cobbles., Born in 1927, Recabarren served as the city’s mayor across two stints in the 1960s and 1990s. He remembers how Antofagasta endured an entire year without water in the 1950s, during which chlorinated water would be delivered sporadically in trucks. Many older houses in the city’s suburbs still have the large riveted water tanks on their rooftops that would receive the supply., The region itself has long served as the industrial powerhouse for the Chilean economy, and the area is dotted with deep mining pits carved into the desert. The Escondida mine near the city is the largest-output copper mine in the world., With mining processes requiring large quantities of water, Antofagasta’s watersheds were steadily drained, and in the year 2000 it was declared that the Loa River in the north of the region – its main surface water source – had run dry. Eventually, industrial desalination technology arrived in the area, with mining companies setting up their own facilities, and pumping effluent back into the sea., “The high concentration of arsenic in the soil used to be our biggest problem as it seeped into the water,” says Recabarren, pulling up his sleeve to reveal white blotches on his skin indicating heavy metal poisoning., “A woman arrived from Spain in the 1950s and died not long after. The autopsy concluded that she had been poisoned – which was quite the scandal – but it turned out to just be the arsenic,” he recalls. “We don’t have that problem anymore; the water quality is very good now because of desalination.”, Despite the clear necessity for a reliable water source, concerns over the ecological impacts of desalination observed by Muñoz have followed quickly behind the implementation of the technology., A suction tower on the sea floor sitting just over 300m from the shore and 20m below the surface draws water slowly into a pipeline, pumping it towards the plant. Its operators say that the intake speed is too low to be hazardous to marine life., Large tanks containing layers of anthracite and sand first remove larger particles, before the water is forced through tightly rolled semi-permeable membranes under high pressure contained within cylinders, separating the filtered water into thick brine and purified water – which is remineralised with calcium compounds before being pumped towards Antofagasta., When you dive around the outlet it is totally white – it looks like it has been snowing, It takes one litre of sea water about 40 minutes to be sucked from the sea bed, processed by the plant and pumped towards Antofagasta as potable water. The highly concentrated waste brine is pumped back into the sea via diffusers 200m from the shore, which Muñoz says are killing wildlife., “When you dive around the outlet it is totally white – it looks like it has been snowing,” says Rodrigo Orrego, a marine biologist at the University of Antofagasta who has been conducting fieldwork around the effluent pipes. “Some species of anemone and clam disappear the closer you get to the discharge point, whereas some others start to appear.”, However, accounts differ as to the environmental impact of the concentrated salt solution., “There are lots of myths and misinformation surrounding desalination,” says Mario Corvalán at the headquarters of Aguas Antofagasta, the private enterprise that operates the plant at La Chimba and holds a monopoly on the region’s sanitary services until 2033., “In fact, our studies have shown that the effluent we pump back into the sea contains such a high concentration of nutrients that life actually thrives around the outlet,” adds Corvalán., “We get people call us up to say that they’ve turned on the tap and now their house smells like the sea, but that can’t be our fault,” says engineer Carlos Jorquera smiling, as he inspects an array of valves at the plant., “The water that leaves the plant contains imperceptible quantities of impurities besides what is added in the remineralisation process,” he explains., However, concerns remain as to the long-term viability of relying so heavily on desalination., “The process isn’t regulated whatsoever,” says Orrego. “There is no specific legislation for desalination in Chile, and that’s our greatest problem.”, The process technically falls under marine rather than land law, meaning that the country’s neoliberal dictatorship-era water code – which commodifies and privatises water use – does not apply to desalinised water., The desalination process also requires huge quantities of energy. For every litre of drinking water produced at La Chimba, 69% of the cost incurred is to power the plant, compared to just 9% for conventional water treatment procedures., With Chile’s water crisis set to intensify over the coming years in the central and northern parts of the country, it is likely that desalination will form an important part of national plans to mitigate issues related to scarcity., As such, local politicians have been keen to redirect the conversation towards cleaning up Chile’s energy mix, with the country committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030., However, Muñoz can ill afford to look too far into the future with his livelihood under immediate threat.

In some cases “almost their entire distribution has been burnt”., So far, the Australian bushfire season has burned through about 5.8m hectares of bush, known across the world for its unique flora and fauna.,  Ecologists say the months of intense and unprecedented fires will almost certainly push several species to extinction. The fires have pushed back conservation efforts by decades, they say, and, as climate heating grips, some species may never recover., Climate scientists have long warned that rising greenhouse gases will spark a wave of extinctions., Now ecologists fear the bushfires represent the catastrophic beginning of a bleak future for the country’s native flora and fauna., “It feels like we have hit a turning point that we predicted was coming as a consequence of climate change,” Legge said. “We are now in uncharted territory.”, Bushfires don’t just burn animals to death but create starvation events. Birds lose their breeding trees and the fruits and invertebrates they feed on. Ground-dwelling mammals that do survive emerge to find an open landscape with nowhere to hide, which one ecologist said became a “hunting arena” for feral cats and foxes., These fires are homogenising the landscape. They benefit no species, “It’s reasonable to infer that there will be dramatic consequences to very many species,” said Prof John Woinarski, of Charles Darwin University. “The fires are of such scale and extent that high proportions of many species, including threatened species, will have been killed off immediately.”, He said footage of kangaroos and flocks of birds fleeing fires was no evidence of their survival. With fires extending so widely, they run out of places to escape., “We know that the species that can’t fly away – like koalas and greater gliders – are gone in burnt areas. Wombats may survive as they’re underground but, even if they do escape the immediate fire front, there’s essentially no food for them in a burnt landscape.”, Woinarski said the critically endangered long-footed potoroo was restricted almost entirely to East Gippsland, which has been devastated by this year’s fires., In southern Queensland, much of the known range of the silver-headed antechinus “has been obliterated by fires”, he said., He said fires had always been a feature of the Australian landscape but in normal circumstances extensive patches of unburnt areas were left, which helped species survive., “There are no winners in fires like this,” he said. “These fires are homogenising the landscape. They benefit no species., “This is a harbinger of a bleak future for our wildlife. They have set back conservation in Australia for a very long period, but the fires are a sign of an even more bleak future ahead. Because of climate change, they will become more frequent and more severe. It’s a sad time for conservation in Australia.”, He said it was “quite likely” the fires would have caused some extinctions but “we won’t know until after this summer ends”., “There’s an obligation now to do immediate reconnaissance for these species.”, Legge offered other examples. The endangered Hastings River mouse, she said, had had about 40% of its known distribution “toasted”. Fire has also covered about a third of the range of the vulnerable rufous scrub-bird., “Even some species that are not snuffed out completely will struggle in the coming months,” she said. “I think this is the end for a number of species.”, One estimate of the number of animals affected by the fires has come from the University of Sydney ecologist Prof Chris Dickman., Using previous research compiled in 2007 on the impact of land clearing in New South Wales, Dickman estimated that about 480 million mammals, birds and reptiles had been affected – but not necessarily all killed. His estimate did not include bats, which are susceptible to fires and are also critical for moving around seeds and pollination., “There is a suite of small animals that live on the forest floor,” he said. “If the cover is removed, then foxes and cats move in and they use the burned areas as open hunting arenas.”, You have these incredibly savage blows and these animals have not evolved to cope with it, As the fires moved into Kosciuszko national park, he was now concerned about the endangered mountain pygmy possum., One important factor, he said, was the ecological role that many affected animals played. Bandicoots and poteroos help to move fungal spores around after fires that promote regrowth. If those animals die, that “ecological service” goes with them., Prof Brendan Wintle, a conservation ecologist at the University of Melbourne, said the scale and timing of the fires was “terrifying”., “If this is what we are seeing now are the beginnings of changes due to climate change, then what are we looking at 2C or 4C? I don’t think we can get our heads around what that could be like. This is not the new normal but it’s a transition to something we have not experienced before., “This is really concerning, not just for the impact that this event will have, but the prospect of this happening on a regular basis is really quite terrifying, and it will be to the point where forest ecosystems have changed to have a different character. When they change you definitely lose species.”, Wintle said species such as the yellow-bellied glider and the greater glider, already threatened by climate change, would be severely affected. “These species require large old trees to den and they can’t survive without at least some large old living trees in their range.”, He said East Gippsland was a stronghold for the two species but it appeared that “vast swathes” of habitat had been burned in recent days., Much of the known range of the endangered brush-tailed rock wallaby – a species already “right on the edge of extinction” – had also been burned, he said., Three-quarters of threatened species in Australia are plants, many of which exist in only small pockets, such as the dark-bract banksia and the blue-top sun orchid., “You can lose the lot in one big fire,” Wintle said. “If the timing is wrong, or the fire is too hot, you can also lose the seed bank and that’s then another species on the extinction list.”, Prof Richard Kingsford, director of the University of New South Wales Centre for Ecosystem Science, said the fires would rob many bird species of vital old-growth trees they need to breed. Fire had taken away the invertebrate bugs the birds feed on, and that food source would not return until there was significant rain., “There are a whole lot of things that are ecologically off the scale,” he said., “We won’t really know how much of a tipping point these fires have been, but the scale in terms of extent and severity I think will be a serious problem for many, many species. It will set back biodiversity in our forests for decades., “You have these incredibly savage blows and these animals have not evolved to cope with it. These fires are not, in the scheme of things, natural., “We don’t see these smaller animals being incinerated.

Common and widespread, Zygiella x-notata is typically found close to human habitation, its webs strung under guttering, and spanning door and window frames. Though similar in appearance to the two-dimensional, concentric-circle webs constructed by its more familiar relative, its orbs usually have a distinctive wedge-shaped segment missing from an upper quadrant, hence the spider’s common name, missing-sector orb-weaver., One afternoon I sat and watched a female spinning a web across my kitchen windowpane. She had already secured anchor lines to the uPVC frame and was methodically running out radial filaments like bicycle spokes, to form the foundation of the structure. Crabbing out her striped legs, she used the tarsal claws at the end of each appendage to grip and tension the silk as it was extruded from the spinnerets on the underside of her abdomen., Once the radii were complete, it took her just under an hour to overlay them. Beginning at the hub, she created a wide-spaced spiral of non-adhesive thread that allowed her to move about the web with ease. Next she worked inwards, weaving a more closely spaced spiral of sticky capture silk, the gap between each coil directly proportional to the distance between the spider’s back legs and spinnerets., In Britain, spiders are more commonly associated with Halloween than the festive season, but in Germany, Poland and Ukraine it’s customary to hang arachnid ornaments on the Christmas tree. This tradition is inspired by an eastern European folktale in which spiders adorn the bare branches of a fir with silver gossamer – the inspiration for tinsel., As the street lamps flickered on, the web bedecking my window shimmered with the lustre of mother of pearl. Illuminated by the bright LED light, the spider’s abdomen had a silvery sheen, an ethereal effect caused by light-reflecting guanine crystals beneath the skin – the same crystalline substance that gives fish scales their iridescent appearance. Superstition dictates that it’s bad luck to leave decorations up after Twelfth Night, but this living jewel and her handiwork won’t be coming down on Sunday.country diary a living jewel and her handiwork adorn the kitchen window", "label": 0}, "train-18": {"text": "Lethal algae blooms – an ecosystem out of balance, \nLethal algae blooms – an ecosystem out of balance\n, Toxic formations across the US and the Baltic are part of a worrying trend linked to the climate crisis and farming methods, by  Jeremy Hance, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 03.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 8 Jan 2020 09.16 EST\n\n, On 3 August 2014, residents of Toledo, Ohio, woke to the news that overnight their water supply had become toxic. They were advised not only to avoid drinking the water, but also touching it – no showers, no baths, not even hand-washing., Boiling the water would only increase its toxicity while drinking it could cause “abnormal liver function, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, numbness or dizziness”, read a statement from the City of Toledo, warning residents to “seek medical attention if you feel you have been exposed”., Toledo sits on the shores of Lake Erie, one of North America’s five great lakes. About half a million residents of the city and surrounding area have relied on Lake Erie for water for hundreds of years., After the news broke on 3 August bottled water quickly vanished in concentric circles around the city. Eventually, a state of emergency was called and the national guard arrived with drinking water., Toledo’s water crisis lasted for nearly three days. But the water wasn’t toxic due to an oil spill or high lead levels, as in Flint, Michigan. Toledo’s water was tainted by something altogether different: an algae bloom.Toledo is not alone. According to scientists, algae blooms are becoming more frequent and more toxic worldwide. A 14-month long algae bloom in Florida, known as the “red tide”, only ended earlier this year, after killing more than 100 manatees, 127 dolphins and 589 sea turtles. Hundreds of tonnes of dead fish also washed ashore. In 2018, there were more than 300 reported incidents of toxic or harmful algae blooms around the world. This year about 130 have been listed on an international database, but that number is expected to increase.Recent reports of a new ‘‘red tide’’ emerging in Florida and more dead wildlife have put the tourist and fishing industries on alert, braced for further devastation. The causes of the blooms vary, and in some cases are never known, but in many parts of the world they are being increasingly linked to climate change and industrialised agriculture., Algae includes everything from micro-algae, like microscopic diatoms, to very large algae, such as seaweed and kelp. Algae are not officially a taxonomic group of creatures (they don’t fit into general groups like plants, animals or fungi), but the name is generally used to describe marine or freshwater species that depend on photosynthesis., An algae bloom occurs when a single member of these species – because of certain conditions – suddenly becomes dominant for a time., Algae are vital to our survival. It’s estimated that at least half of the planet’s oxygen comes from these unsung creatures, who produce it through photosynthesis before releasing it into the water. Algae, like land plants, also sequester carbon dioxide; scientists have explored their potential to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. They have been used as fertiliser, food sources (such as seaweed), and could be a promising source of biofuel in a more sustainable world., However, some algae blooms can also be harmful – even lethal., Harmful algae bloom (HAB), as scientists have come to describe the phenomenon, often manifest by forming a kind of scum over a body of water that can be green, blue, brown or even red. But others are completely invisible. The problem has become increasingly widespread and the impact can be deadly to marine life., Off the eastern coast of the US, a dinoflagellate – a type of marine plankton named Alexandrium catenella – has the potential to make shellfish lethal. Its appearance routinely shuts down fisheries, crippling local economies. And it’s not just in the US: the same species has shut down mussel farms and recreational collecting of shellfish as far away as New Zealand., Other blooms wipe out marine life. In 2015, a bloom of various dinoflagellates off the coast of South Africa led to low-oxygen conditions, known as eutrophication, killing 200 tonnes of rock lobster. Freshwater blooms, like those in Lake Erie made up of cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, have not only shut down local water sources but have also been blamed for the death of dogs that had been swimming in them., It’s difficult to make generalisations about harmful algae blooms since specific species have different causes and impacts. Scientists have identified about 100 toxic bloom species in the oceans. Dozens of potentially harmful species of cyanobacteria are known to affect bodies of fresh water., During most of the past century, harmful algae blooms were rarely headline news, inspiring little scientific study beyond ecological curiosity. That has changed. Algae blooms are notoriously difficult to predict, but a global monitoring group known as HAEDAT is tracking them across the world as they occur. Harmful algae blooms, such as the one that hit Toledo’s water supply in 2014, are becoming more common and more toxic – and scientists say humans are to blame., “There’s no question that the HAB problem is a major global issue, and it is growing,” said Donald Anderson, director of the US National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms and a lab director at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. “We also have more toxins, more toxic species, more areas and resources affected, and higher economic losses.” , The toxic bloom that took over Lake Erie in 2014 was formed by a cyanobacteria known as Microcystis Aeruginosa, for which farming is at least partly to blame., “You have people that still to this day will only use bottled water,” says Dr Timothy Davis, an expert in plankton ecology at Bowling Green University, five years after the water crisis and even after Toledo spent $132 million (£101 million) on improving its water treatment plant to handle the blue-green algae., Lake Erie, the shallowest of North America’s Great Lakes, has seen such events in the past. During the 1950s and 60s algae blooms were common, most likely, say researchers, due to poor domestic and industrial wastewater treatment., “At one point, Lake Erie was considered a dead lake,” Davis says. But by the early 1970s, the “dead lake” was resurrected, due to new regulations from the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that capped phosphorus loads into the lake at 11,000 tonnes. Phosphorus provides nutrients to plants and is commonly found in manure and produced for fertiliser., Then in the late-1990s, blooms began to reappear. A cyanobacteria bloom requires two things: nutrients and heat. In the case of Lake Erie, nearby farms have become increasingly reliant on large inputs of synthetic fertiliser., “We went from agriculture that was small farms and a variety of crops to larger commercial farms that were harvested for essentially two row crops, corn and soya beans,” says Davis. Today, corn and soya beans are Ohio’s top crops., Employing more fertiliser to feed a global market, the farms’ excess phosphorus and nitrogen, another plant nutrient, washed out during storms and into the river and streams that feed Lake Erie. About 80% of the nutrients running into Lake Erie are from sources around the Maumee River, which in this case means agricultural runoff from the surrounding farmland., “If you have an agricultural system where the farmer can only survive by polluting Lake Erie, then there’s something fundamentally wrong with that system,” says Dr Thomas Bridgeman, director of the Lake Erie Center., Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has seen a bloom every year – and they appear to be lasting longer and getting larger. This year’s bloom in Lake Erie was the fifth largest since 2002 – when monitoring began in earnest. It was 620 square miles at its largest after growing throughout August, before dissipating in September., Meanwhile, climate change has heated up our planet substantially. Nearby Lake Superior, the most northerly of the Great Lakes and the world’s largest, has had its first documented cyanobacteria blooms over the past decade. Before climate change, the lake simply would have been too cold for a long-lasting bloom., It’s now almost a certainty that blooms will continue to appear every summer, say researchers, unless Ohio changes its agricultural practices and the global community finally tackles the climate crisis., “We have to look around and say, ‘Look, what do we grow here?’” says Bridgeman. “We grow corn and soya beans. Where does the corn go? It goes into our gas tanks. Where do the soya beans go? They go to China, they go to hogs. Is that really what we want to be doing with our watershed?”, Algal blooms are also becoming more common and severe in many parts of our oceans, harming wildlife and posing potentially dangerous health impacts for local communities., Scientists say the “red tide” that stuck around the Florida coast from 2017 through to this year may now be a semi-normal part of the ecosystem., These blooms are pumping poison into the air, known as brevetoxin, which may be harmful to humans if inhaled. Anyone breathing it in can suffer from uncontrollable coughing and a sore throat. “It doesn’t make for a pleasant day at the beach,” says Malcolm McFarland, a researcher into algae blooms with the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in Fort Pierce, Florida., It may have long-term health implications as well – one study found that brevetoxin attacked the DNA of lungs in rats, but further research is needed to understand the impact on human health., Scientists are less certain about the causes of these red tide marine blooms, but both nutrient runoff and climate change may play a role. “The red tide seems to initiate and peak in the rainy season when runoff from the land is highest, and nutrient inputs to freshwater and coastal water bodies spike,” says McFarland., Meanwhile, on the other side of the north American continent, a different red tide is attacking a different species: California is seeing more sick sea lions taken in by rescue centres; pups and adults are dying., Scientists believe they are suffering from eating fish tainted by Pseudo-nitzschia australis algae. The highly toxic algae are fatal at high doses, both to sea lions and humans., Unlike Florida’s red tides, those in California appear to be a very recent arrival. Until the turn of the millennium, large-scale toxic blooms were rare off the coast of California. Then something changed., “From 2000 forward, we had a very significant bloom every single year with ecosystem impacts in California, and that has never stopped. Not only that, it seemed as though things were getting more and more toxic,” says Clarissa Anderson, the executive director at Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System, nothing that in less than 20 years of research, scientists have seen toxin numbers multiply by 200 – from 500 to 100,000 nanograms per litre of sea water. Anderson says the current best working theory is that increasing carbon sequestration by the oceans – due to the huge increase in greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution – is behind the sudden regularity of these deadly blooms and an increase in their toxicity. She says the study of these events and their toxins is so new that there may be incidents of illness from eating affected fish or shellfish that are misdiagnosed because these poisons are not on the radar of many health organisations., Europe has had its own experience of deadly algae blooms that now threaten the future of its fisheries. Last year, the Baltic Sea experienced a bloom so large it could have encompassed Manhattan, and it closed beaches from Finland to Poland. Finland has been systematically sampling its area of the Baltic since 1979, giving us a clearer idea of the spread and growth of the problem, and what’s to blame. In that time, blooms have become larger and longer-lasting, creating dead zones and depleting Baltic fisheries., Like the example in Lake Erie, the Baltic bloom is caused by an influx of nutrients from agriculture and warming waters.Scientists are regularly tracking nutrient loads from Finland’s rivers into the sea. Data from 2014 in the HELCOM Pollution Load Compilation database, the best currently available, found that more than three-quarters of the nutrient load coming into the Archipelago Sea is from agriculture. The number is surprisingly similar to the proportion coming from industrialised agriculture in Ohio., The Baltic is a brackish water body, thus supporting blooms typical of both fresh and salt water. But, as in Lake Erie, of real concern are cyanobacteria: several species have been known to produce blooms here., Below the sea’s surface there has been a decline in the more nutritious phytoplankton – and food for fish – and an increase in the potentially toxic species in the more southerly parts of the sea since the early 1980s.Milder winters and increased rainfall pushing more nutrients into the sea, along with higher surface water temperatures – all due to the climate crisis – are also exacerbating factors, say researchers. Blooms usually begin in July and disappear by August or September. But last year a species particularly resistant to coldremained until November. “The ice was blue-green because of the cyanobacteria under it,” says Sirpa Lehtinen, an expert on plankton for the Marine Research Centre with the Finnish Environmental Institute, who adds that scientists are still trying to work out what this all means for the marine ecosystem, and whether fisheries in the Baltic are in serious long-term peril., So how can we solve a problem like algae? The answer, says Davis, will be part-regional, part-global solutions. For Lake Erie, it will require agricultural changes – including regulations to reduce the nutrient load – and tackling the climate crisis. But solutions elsewhere may be different, for example, blooms in developing countries might require better wastewater treatment., The 2014 water crisis in Ohio forced the issue politically which hasn’t happened in many other places. Governor Mike DeWine recently announced an initiative called H2Ohio, which is expected to include hundreds of millions of dollars for Lake Erie and other Ohio water bodies over the next 10 years. However, scientists say this is not enough., “It’s going to take a lot more money and a lot more political will than what’s happening right now,” says Bridgeman., At the Ohio Department of Agriculture,director Dorothy Pelanda said the department was primarily looking at voluntary programmes based on marketing and education for potential solutions such as cover crops and smarter use of fertiliser. In 2014, Ohio passed new regulations on fertiliser use for farms near the lake: such as not spreading before a storm or on frozen fields., “We know from science that there is not one solution to every farm … It’s about education, it’s about being sensitive to what works, what doesn’t work,” she said. She’s hoping to provide increased access for farmers to use high-tech, but often expensive, equipment that can give them a better idea of what parts of their land may need fertiliser and how much., Pelanda said she’s also seen interest in diversifying crops beyond corn and soya beans, to grapes, chestnuts and maple sugar. Asked if voluntary programmes will go far enough, Pelanda says: “That’s our challenge. We have to get beyond. We’re doing these things … but we’re not doing enough of these things. We need to really increase the voluntary adoption of these practices.”, Others are more sceptical of voluntary approaches. “We have a long history in this country of a farmer does what he wants on his land. You can choose to take advantage of a programme or something, but you can also choose not to,” says Bridgeman, who believes local and federal governments can no longer afford to ignore the climate emergency. “We need to do something about climate change and we’re either going to be paying for it by reducing greenhouse gases or we’re going to be paying for it by additional treatment of water,” says Bridgeman, adding that most of the blooms around the world have a human element to them., One thing is certain. Algae blooms aren’t going away but are yet another sign – like ocean acidification, vanishing Arctic sea ice, and mass extinction of the Anthropocene – “of an ecosystem that is out of balance,” says McFarland., • This article was amended on 8 January 2020 to remove a reference to “toxic cryptophytes”. Cryptophytes are not toxic. Also, the text was changed to clarify that baltic bloom in Lake Erie is caused by a range of nutrients, not just nitrogen from farming.lethal algae blooms an ecosystem out of balance", "label": 0}, "train-19": {"text": "\nTougher penalties needed to curb surge in fly-tipping, say councils\n, Illegal dumping has surged by 50% since 2012 but powers to issue big fines are going unused, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 02.30 EST\n\n, Fly-tipping has increased by 50% in the last six years, prompting councils to call for much bigger penalties for offenders., More than a million incidents of illegal rubbish dumping were recorded in the financial year 2018-19, which cost councils £58m to clean up. Most incidents involved household waste being jettisoned from cars or vans by the side of a road., The maximum fine for fly-tipping is £50,000 and/or a five-year prison sentence. But 83% of the court-imposed fines in the last six years were below £500. Only two people have been given the maximum fine since new guidelines were introduced in 2014., Councils are handing out more on-the-spot fines and pursuing more prosecutions. Offending vehicles can be seized and in some cases are crushed. The number seized jumped to 207 last year. However, councils have lost 60% of their central government funding since 2010, meaning less money is available for action against fly-tippers., “Fly-tipping is not only an illegal, inexcusable and ugly blight on society, it is a serious public health risk,” said David Renard, the environment spokesman for the Local Government Association and leader of Swindon borough council. “Councils are determined to crack down on the problem. However, tougher sentences are needed to act as a stronger deterrent to criminals dumping waste., “This is why we want to work with the government on reviewing sentencing guidelines for fly-tipping, so offenders are given bigger fines for more serious offences, and ensure councils have the funding needed to investigate incidents.”, The underlying causes of the rising trend in fly-tipping are not known for certain, but council officials say they have seen a rise in “man in a van” incidents, where unlicensed operators collect rubbish then dump it., Stricter rules at council tips and charges for some refuse disposal may also be a factor. However, an increase in reporting could be responsible for part of the rise, as councils are providing more ways in which members of the public can report rubbish dumping., Fly-tipping incidents in England fell from 1.3m in 2007-08 to 0.7m in 2012-13, according to government data. But there has been a steady rise since then to 1.1m in 2018-19. Total fines of £1m were levied last year., Recent incidents include a delivery driver caught fly-tipping on four occasions in Hertfordshire being fined £300. In Wiltshire, a man advertising a cheap waste clearance service on Facebook was in fact fly-tipping the rubbish. He was fined £3,275., “If someone offers to take your waste away cheaply, it will probably end up being fly-tipped in our beautiful countryside,” said the Wiltshire councillor Bridget Wayman. “You may also find yourself with a £200 fixed penalty notice and a bill for the clear-up costs.” She advised people to check that operators are properly licensed., Fly-tipping has fallen by half in Wolverhampton after its council launched a “shop a tipper” campaign in January, where residents receive a £100 gift voucher for information leading to a fine or successful prosecution., The council has also crushed two transit vans and two cars caught fly-tipping on CCTV. “We do not want fly-tipping in our city.

Wild clematis (Clematis vitalba) has become a familiar companion, roping together every dog walk, ride, run and drive I have done in my home counties of Berkshire, Hampshire and Wiltshire., This most magical of chalk plants has an ability to appear and disappear, seemingly at will – although this is weather related. In wet weather, the sodden, damson-coloured seedheads turn spidery and go unnoticed. In dry weather, however, the feathery plumes fluff and curl in on themselves to form globes that catch the light. Then they form an ethereal smoke blossom in silver, gold or bronze, appearing at the same hour for days before vanishing, then reappearing. The plant has a phantom quality., Halfway between the two weathers, particularly in fog, the seedhead centres of the globes each hold a pearl of light in a drop of water. Diffused by fronds like miniature ostrich plumes, they glow like tiny Victorian gas lamps, or dimming fairy lights., Wild clematis has many names: traveller’s joy, old man’s beard, shepherd’s delight, smokewood. My preferred name is bedwine, from the old Berkshire border dialect. Adam Thorpe revived the name in his novel of this place, Ulverton. Bedwine twines through the centuries and chapters of his book. It’s a curious name, until you say “betwined” in the accent, dropping the “t”, then the “d”., This winter, I used the thick vines hanging from tall trees as a swing. Hanging down like ropes in a school gymnasium and stirring childhood memories, the great, twisted, straw-like cables seemed to suggest I should. I stepped into a creaking loop half a metre off the ground, like a nervous novice trapeze artist, above a shallow chalk pit netted with it. A hank uncoiled. It did not break, but I was tipped upside down, scattering wood pigeons, caught by an ankle and the unyielding, twisted vine that had somehow slipped around my waist. I wriggled free and made a slow, undignified fall into the safety net below, just out of a flailing arm’s reach.country diary wild clematis in winter is a magical plant", "label": 0}, "train-21": {"text": "\nJakarta floods: cloud seeding planes try to break up heavy rain\n, Dozens dead in Indonesian capital and surrounds as role of global heating is acknowledged in ‘extreme’ event, Agencies, \n\nFri 3 Jan 2020 22.23 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 2 Jan 2020 23.10 EST\n\n, Indonesia carried out cloud seeding to try to prevent further rainfall over the capital, Jakarta, and surrounding areas as the death toll reached 47 on Saturday amid flash floods and landslides.,  Two small planes had earlier been readied to drop sodium chloride to break up potential rain clouds in the skies above the Sunda Strait, Indonesia’s technology agency said., Tens of thousands of Indonesians were crammed in emergency shelters waiting for floodwaters to recede in and around Jakarta after the massive new year’s flooding, officials said., Monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged a dozen districts in greater Jakarta and caused landslides in the Bogor and Depok districts on the city’s outskirts, as well as in neighbouring Lebak, which buried a dozen people. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said the fatalities included those who had drowned or been electrocuted since rivers broke their banks early on Wednesday after extreme torrential rains throughout new year’s eve. Three elderly people died of hypothermia.It was the worst flooding since 2007, when 80 people were killed over 10 days., “The waters came very fast, suddenly everything in my house was swept away,” said Dian Puspitasari, a mother of two. Four days after the region of 30 million people was struck by flash floods, waters have receded in many middle-class districts but conditions remained grim in narrow riverside alleys where the city’s poor live., Wibowo said about 397,000 people had sought refuge in shelters across the greater metropolitan area. Those returning to their homes found streets covered in mud and debris. Cars that had been parked in driveways were swept away, landing upside down in parks or piled up in narrow alleys., Sidewalks were strewn with sandals, pots and pans and old photographs. Authorities took advantage of the receding waters to clear away mud and remove piles of wet garbage from the streets., Cloud seeding or shooting salt flares into clouds in an attempt to trigger rainfall is often used in Indonesia to put out forest fires during the dry season., Authorities on Thursday used hundreds of pumps to suck water out of residential areas and public infrastructure like railways.

So they are using data from sources such as satellites, sonar and radar to keep a closer eye on how many whales are in the ocean. , A project involving complex data and surveillance has an easy to understand name: Counting Whales From Space. But John Irvine, chief scientist for data analytics at Draper, said that was the only simple thing about the project., “If whales are moving out of one area and into another,” Irving said, “what’s the reason for that? Is it due to ocean warming? Is it changes in commercial shipping lanes? These are all questions we’ll be able to start answering once we have the data.” , The work will involve gathering data from sources ranging from European space agencies to amateur radio operators, in order to create a probability map of where in the ocean the whales might be, Irvine said. Conservation groups will then be able to monitor whales and their movements, he said. , The aquarium and Draper have committed a combined $1m to the project, which is expected to develop over several years. , Aerial surveys are the most frequently used method to count whales, partners on the project said. However, that approach is expensive, subject to bad weather conditions and can be dangerous. , Project members said their goal is to develop new technology that uses specially designed algorithms to process data and monitor whales. Exactly what the final product could look like is a work in progress, Irvine said, but the goal is a “global watch on whale movement”. , The technology could be used to monitor whales anywhere in the world, said Vikki Spruill, president of New England Aquarium, but some of the most pressing need for monitoring is just off New England., Those waters are a home to the endangered North Atlantic right whale, which numbers only about 400 and is declining. Better data and surveillance tools could help inform conservation of the species and others elsewhere, Spruill said, especially since whales rarely respect international boundaries. , “These are animals that move across large areas of our ocean,” she said. “Large marine animals don’t have boundaries like we would think of on land.” counting whales from space new england aquarium draper", "label": 0}, "train-23": {"text": "\nCutting battery industry's reliance on cobalt will be an uphill task\n, Electric cars and consumer electronics use mineral mined in exploitative conditions in Congo, \nJasper Jolly, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 07.54 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Jan 2020 15.35 EST\n\n, Followers of Elon Musk are used to big claims on Twitter. The social media habits of the Tesla and SpaceX billionaire have landed him in legal hot water on several occasions. But for the battery industry one boast stands out: a tweeted pledge to remove an obscure mineral mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo from the next generation of Tesla’s electric cars., Batteries are the key component in the electric car revolution that Tesla kickstarted, and each one contains cobalt. Yet concerns about human rights abuses and child labour have prompted a dual effort to cut the amount of cobalt used in batteries and to clean up complex global supply chains., The battery industry accounts for the majority of global cobalt demand, and that demand is set to soar with more than $60bn (£46bn) of investments in new battery factories during 2019, according to the data firm Benchmark Minerals. Musk tweeted his pledge in 2018 but demand for cobalt has since accelerated. Benchmark’s forecasts suggest that global demand for cobalt in 2029 will be 300,000 tonnes compared with an estimated 70,000 tonnes used in 2019., Almost three-quarters of the world’s cobalt supply is sourced from the DRC, a country whose rule of law is among the weakest in the world and which consequently has a terrible record on working conditions and child labour. The majority is then shipped to China, the world’s largest battery manufacturer, to be processed., The car industry is by no means the only one implicated: the electronics manufacturers Apple, Google, Dell and Microsoft, as well as Tesla, were named in a US lawsuit last month by families who say their children were killed while mining cobalt used in their products. However, the surge in electric car sales – as regulations limit exhaust pipe carbon dioxide emissions – and the kilograms needed in each car mean that cobalt supply concerns will only become more acute., There are as many as 150,000 artisanal miners in Kolwezi, the regional capital in southern DRC that has become a major mining centre, according to Mark Dummett, a researcher on business and human rights at Amnesty International. Children working at the mines are easy to find within a five-minute drive of the city centre, he said., There has been some progress. The Congolese government has promised to pilot regulated areas for artisanal miners. Increasing consumer awareness has also led to supply chain auditing projects such as the Responsible Sourcing Network, run by the nonprofit organisation As You Sow, as well as two industry-led bodies, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance and Responsible Mining Initiative, to ensure that suppliers are up to standards set by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development., Cobalt’s human and financial costs, as well as the technological imperative to increase energy density, have prompted research efforts by battery makers to reduce their reliance on the metal., Most electric vehicle batteries use lithium ions, with nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) in various proportions in the cathode, a key part of any battery. Early batteries contained the three metals in equal proportions, but companies such as South Korea’s SK Innovation and LG Chem are close to producing cathodes with 80% nickel and only 10% cobalt, known as NMC 811. However, chemists have struggled to remove all cobalt, which is prized for stabilising the battery during recharging., The FTSE 100 chemicals company Johnson Matthey has been working on reducing the amount of cobalt in its enhanced lithium nickel oxide (eLNO) batteries at one of its research labs in Sonning Common, near Reading. Its batteries, thought to contain higher levels of manganese, could cut cobalt costs in half, according to analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance., Johnson Matthey chose Poland for a factory to mass-manufacture the products, opening in 2022, which will eventually produce 10,000 tonnes of battery material a year. BASF and Umicore, rivals from Germany and Belgium, are also working on lower-cobalt chemistries., The demand for batteries has pulled in investors from unlikely places. The US miner Platinum Group Metals is funding research by Florida International University into using palladium and platinum in battery cathodes and electrolytes, potentially delivering improvements to recharge speeds and stability., The company’s chief executive, R Michael Jones, hopes that these technologies – which are still years away from prototype stage – will sustain demand for palladium and platinum, which are used for catalytic converters in internal combustion engine cars., Smaller British companies are also in the race, hoping to emulate the Nobel prize-winning Oxford University researchers who pioneered the lithium ion battery in the 1970s. Oxis Energy, based in the same research centre, is trying to develop lithium sulphur batteries with a claimed five times the energy density of current technology., Yet Caspar Rawles, a senior analyst at Benchmark Minerals, cautions that it will be years before battery manufacturers manage to eliminate cobalt completely. Recent price volatility has limited investment in new capacity, and the two-year shutdown of Glencore’s Mutanda mine near Kolwezi could mean that artisanal miners become a key source of the metal as demand increases., Tesla’s first Model S, launched in 2012, was built with an average of 11kg of cobalt per vehicle, but according to Benchmark Minerals that was down to about 4.5kg in its successor car, the Model 3, which launched in 2018. That has been achieved using a nickel-cobalt-aluminium chemistry. However, further reductions in line with Musk’s ambitions could be significantly harder. Tesla declined to share more details of its cobalt-reduction plans with the Guardian., Either way, battery makers have a responsibility to the people of DRC, many thousands of whom rely on cobalt mining for a living, said Amnesty’s Dummett. “It’s still a relatively new sector, and now is the opportunity to adopt responsible sourcing,” he said.cutting cobalt challenge battery industry electric cars congo", "label": 0}, "train-24": {"text": "\nFukushima unveils plans to become renewable energy hub\n, Japan aims to power region, scene of 2011 meltdown, with 100% renewable energy by 2040, \nJustin McCurry in Tokyo, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 06.57 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 05.49 EST\n\n, Fukushima is planning to transform itself into a renewable energy hub, almost nine years after it became the scene of the world’s worst nuclear accident for a quarter of a century., The prefecture in north-east Japan will forever be associated with the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on 11 March 2011, but in an ambitious project the local government has vowed to power the region with 100% renewable energy by 2040, compared with 40% today., The 2011 accident, triggered by a powerful earthquake and tsunami, sent large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 residents., The 300bn yen ($2.75bn) project, whose sponsors include the government-owned Development Bank of Japan and Mizuho Bank, will involve the construction of 11 solar and 10 wind farms on abandoned farmland and in mountainous areas by the end of March 2024, according to the Nikkei Asian Review., A 80km grid will connect Fukushima’s power generation with the Tokyo metropolitan area, once heavily dependent on nuclear energy produced at the prefecture’s two atomic plants. When completed, the project will generate up to 600 megawatts of electricity, roughly two-thirds the output of an average nuclear power plant., Despite the Fukushima disaster, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, Japan’s conservative government is pushing to restart idle reactors., It wants nuclear power, which generated almost a third of the country’s power before Fukushima, to make up between 20% and 22% of its overall energy mix by 2030, drawing criticism from campaigners who say nuclear plants pose a danger given the country’s vulnerability to earthquakes and tsunami., All of Japan’s 54 reactors were shut down after the Fukushima meltdown. Nine reactors are in operation today, having passed stringent safety checks introduced after the disaster., Renewables accounted for 17.4% of Japan’s energy mix in 2018, according to the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, well below countries in Europe. The government iaims to increase this to between 22% and 24% by 2030 a target the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has described as ambitious but which climate campaigners criticise as insufficient., Abe insists nuclear energy will help Japan achieve its carbon dioxide emissions targets and reduce its dependence on imported gas and oil, but his recently appointed environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, has called for the country’s nuclear reactors to be scrapped to prevent a repeat of the Fukushima disaster., “We will be doomed if we allow another nuclear accident to occur. We never know when we’ll have an earthquake,” Koizumi said when he joined Abe’s cabinet in September., The government is unlikely to meet its target of 30 reactor restarts by 2030 given strong local opposition and legal challenges., Japan faces mounting international criticism over its dependence on imported coal and natural gas. It received the “fossil of the day” award from the Climate Action Network at last month’s UN climate change conference in Madrid after its industry minister announced plans to continue using coal-fired power., Japan is the third-biggest importer of coal after India and China, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Its megabanks have been urged to end their financing of coal-fired plants in Vietnam and other developing countries in Asia.fukushima unveils plans to become renewable energy hub japan", "label": 0}, "train-25": {"text": "Britons reach Africans’ annual carbon emissions in just two weeks, Research for Oxfam shows inequality between footprints of people in UK and in countries including Rwanda, Ethiopia and Malawi, The average British person will have emitted more carbon dioxide in the first two weeks of this year than a citizen of any one of seven African nations does in an entire year., This is the key finding of an Oxfam project, published on Sunday, which discovered that someone in the UK will take just five days to emit the same carbon as someone in Rwanda does in a year., And by next Sunday, 12 January, the average Briton’s emissions will have overtaken the annual per capita emissions of a further six African countries: Madagascar, Malawi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Guinea and Burkina Faso., The study revealed that annual emissions of carbon dioxide, per head of population, is 0.09 tonnes in Rwanda, 0.19 in Malawi and 0.25 in Burkina Faso. Further up the scale, it was found that Nigeria emits 0.49 tonnes of carbon per person every year while in India the figure is 1.68. These figures compare with a global average of 4.7 tonnes per person per year. In Britain the figure is 8.3., Danny Sriskandarajah, the chief executive of Oxfam GB, described the scale of global inequality revealed by the study as staggering. “It’s a shock to realise that in just a few days our high-carbon lifestyles here in the UK produce the same emissions as the annual footprint of people in some poor countries. However, the encouraging thing is the willingness of the British public to take action.”, This view is supported by the results of a YouGov poll, carried out for Oxfam and also published on Sunday. It shows that 61% of people in Britain want the government to do more to address the climate emergency. Most respondents also say they would be willing to act to reduce their own carbon footprints., The poll found that 55% of Britons say they worry about the impact of global heating and as many as 79% said they were likely to take one of a number of actions to reduce their carbon footprint., Responses ranged from 79% of people who said they were likely to recycle more, down to 38% who were likely to change their diet, such as by eating less meat or dairy. More than two-thirds (68%) said they were likely to use energy-efficient products or utility providers, and almost half to limit their air travel (49%) or buy ethically made or second-hand products (49%)., “Just as large numbers of the public are resolving to reduce their carbon footprint, we need a bold new year’s resolution from the prime minister to get us on track to net-zero emissions much earlier than the current 2050 deadline,” added Sriskandarajah. “As the UK government gets ready to host global climate talks later this year, it needs to show that it is deadly serious about leading the fight against climate change.”britain annual carbon emissions overtake africa two weeks oxfam", "label": 0}, "train-26": {"text": "\nEnvironmentally friendly electric cars: the pedestrian’s enemy?\n, \nAnna Tims, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 02.46 EST\n\n, They are symbols of environmental friendliness, but electric cars could be making environments increasingly unfriendly to pedestrians. Inaudible engines and obstructive charging systems are putting people with disabilities or pushchairs at risk, according to road safety campaigners who say that pedestrians are paying a hidden price for the green revolution., Dave Taylor, a resident in the London Borough of Ealing, contacted the Observer after reading an article on charging electric vehicles. “My photo of the car with the charging cable across the pavement highlights a very real issue that is not being addressed,” he says., “I recently contacted my local authority about a dangerously trailing cable and was told safety is the responsibility of the individual driver, not the charging point provider or the council, even though local authorities are the responsible body for public health and safety., “The industry benchmark is that vehicles should be parked adjacent to the charging point but Ealing says if they were to introduce dedicated bays, resident permit holders would offer resistance to losing space.”, Motorists can charge their vehicles on- or off-road from points in their homes, or from the growing number of publicly available installations., Ealing Council told the Observer that it was in the process of updating its website to make it clear that cables should not be extended across footways from home and said its 183 communal charge points were fitted with short cables to prevent them from becoming a trip hazard., However, the photograph of a street in the borough supplied by Taylor shows a cable trailing several feet along the kerb to a car parked further down the street., “If someone were to trip and suffer an injury it would be up to them to pursue the person who plugged it in through litigation. Pretty difficult and costly,” he says. “Councils are sidestepping responsibility.”, Gaps in government guidelines mean that there are no specific restrictions on how and where vehicles can be charged in public spaces. The Department for Transport told the Observer that the safety of all road users was a priority, but its guidance for drivers and councils only addresses the technical and funding issues of charge points, with no word on the needs of other road users., Responsibility for maintaining safe environments falls to councils, which can potentially impose £100 fixed penalties for wilfully obstructing the highway or depositing things which cause injury or danger., A number of local authorities are themselves contributing to the problem by installing bulky charge points on pavements, squeezing out pedestrians to free up road space for traffic and avoid antagonising parking permit holders. While some charge points do come with dedicated parking bays, many are designed to provide what Ealing calls “flexibility”. Flexibility, that is, for drivers who can park in any available slot – or even on pavements – and extend the cable along the footway to reach their car., Government grants for domestic charge points are only available to homeowners with off-street parking and, to encourage demand, councils are under growing pressure to provide urban households with on-street facilities., The Office for Low Emission Vehicles has made £4.5m available to councils for 2019-20 and, amid the rush to claim a share, the charity Living Streets has launched a campaign to protect footways from being sacrificed for the benefit of drivers. Its website provides template letters to raise concerns with local councils., “If the vision is that we all move towards electric vehicles in the future, then there is the potential for cables to be trailing from every home across every pavement,” says Living Streets’ Kathryn Shaw. “We need to get this right, or we’ll be stuck forever with unsuitable and dangerous infrastructure.”, The charity is calling for charging points to be installed in car parks or off pavements and also wants the government to follow Scotland’s lead in banning any parking on pavements from 2021., And as the adoption of electric vehicles rises year on year, their soundless motors can pose problems for pedestrians, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. , Since July, all new prototypes must emit a noise before being approved in Europe, but there is no such requirement for the estimated 255,000 now on British roads, or models currently being manufactured. Helen Honstvet of the charity Guide Dogs says: “We are concerned that the roll-out of sound generators, in line with the EU regulations, is not happening quickly enough – sound generators are only required on new models, whereas they should be compulsory on all new electric cars and drivers should face consequences if they fail to maintain an audible warning system.”, David Bailey, a professor at Birmingham Business School and the driver of his own Nissan Leaf electric car, says that while the UK’s charging infrastructure needs investment, electric cars are not going away., “It’s quite the opposite – 2020 is going to see a big rise in electric car sales across Europe as car manufacturers face heavy penalties if the average carbon dioxide emissions from all the cars they sell is above 95g per kilometre. By mid-2020, electric cars are expected to match combustion-engined cars in terms of price and ease of use. While the UK still lags behind some European countries – particularly for fast chargers – we will simply have to sort out the charging infrastructure to match the numbers being driven,” he says., Not everyone is so sure. Shaw is adamant we should be focusing on other ways to get around. “Electric vehicles do not solve congestion or all our air-quality problems – the suggestion they do is incredibly misleading,” she says. “Fundamentally, we need to change the way we travel. The new government needs to prioritise active travel to tackle unacceptable road danger, climate change, toxic levels of air pollution and the health crisis due to sedentary lifestyles., “Our towns and cities should be places where walking is the natural choice for local, every-day journeys and blocking up pavements with EV charging points and cables flies in the face of that.”electric cars environment hazards pedestrians", "label": 0}, "train-27": {"text": "\nTrump administration to overhaul environmental review regulations\n, Regulations would limit projects that require environmental review and no longer require agencies to weigh climate impacts, Reuters in Washington, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 11.58 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 12.10 EST\n\n, The Trump administration is set to unveil new regulations which would limit the types of projects like highways and pipelines that require environmental review and no longer require federal agencies to weigh their climate impacts, sources familiar with the plan said., The proposed overhaul will update how federal agencies implement the bedrock National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), a law meant to ensure the government protects the environment when reviewing or making decisions about major projects, from building roads and bridges, cutting forests, expanding broadband to approving interstate pipelines such as the Keystone XL., The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is expected to announce that federal agencies will not be required to consider cumulative climate crisis impacts when considering federal projects, said two people familiar with the CEQ rule-making., The CEQ oversees how nearly 80 government agencies meet their Nepa obligations. It is also expected to limit the scope of projects that would trigger stringent reviews called environmental impact studies, expand the number of project categories that can be excluded from Nepa reviews and allow companies or project developers to conduct their own environmental assessments, the sources said., CEQ declined to comment., In a memorandum commemorating the 50th anniversary of the signing of Nepa on 1 January, Donald Trump said the Nepa overhaul would speed up permit approvals for “project sponsors and ordinary Americans”., “CEQ has conducted a thorough review of its Nepa implementing regulations and will soon issue a proposal to update those regulations to address the many concerns my administration has heard from hardworking Americans, small businesses, and state and local officials,” Trump said., Environmental groups are concerned that by weakening Nepa implementation, the US will lose a significant tool to combat and guard against climate crisis impacts and allow companies to harm local communities with less scrutiny., Christy Goldfuss, chair of the CEQ between 2015 and 2017, said the Trump proposal would cause lasting damage. She said environmental groups have successfully blocked or delayed a dozen big polluting projects in courts by arguing that Trump agencies failed to weigh climate impacts in their reviews, a requirement created under the Obama administration., “This proposal is really about trying to remove that barrier of the courts,” she said., Stephen Schima, lead Nepa attorney for Earthjustice, said weakening Nepa implementation would deprive local communities of “the most widespread mechanism of citizen involvement in government”., In November, more than 30 of the country’s biggest industry groups, ranging from the Chamber of Commerce to the American Petroleum Institute, called on CEQ to hurry the release of the Nepa “modernization”, saying it was long overdue.trump administration environmental review regulations", "label": 0}, "train-28": {"text": "Shutdown of US coal power facilities saved over 26,000 lives, study finds, Shift to gas saved more than 300m tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide as nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide levels dropped, ﻿The human toll from coal-fired pollution in America has been laid bare by a study that has found more than 26,000 lives were saved in the US in just a decade due to the shift from coal to gas for electricity generation., The shutdown of scores of coal power facilities across the US has reduced the toxic brew of pollutants suffered by nearby communities, cutting deaths from associated health problems such as heart disease and respiratory issues, the research found., An estimated 26,610 lives were saved in the US by the shift away from coal between 2005 and 2016, according to the University of California study published in Nature Sustainability., The coal sector has struggled in recent years, with 334 generating units taken offline during the period analyzed in the study. A cheap glut of natural gas has displaced coal, with 612 gas-fired units coming online during this time., As a result, more than 300m tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide has been saved, while levels of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, emitted by coal plants and linked to irritations of the nose and throat, dropped by 60% and 80%, respectively., “When you turn coal units off you see deaths go down. It’s something we can see in a tangible way,” said Jennifer Burney, a University of California academic who authored the study. “There is a cost to coal beyond the economics. We have to think carefully about where plants are sited, as well as how to reduce their pollutants.”, While a swift transition away from coal is seen by experts as imperative to limit global heating and the worst impacts of the climate crisis, there is a counterintuitive short-term local increase in warming once coal plants are shut down. This is because these plants emit aerosols that scatter sunlight, slightly cooling the surface., The natural gas that is replacing coal is “not entirely benign”, Burney’s research points out. Gas is, like coal, a fossil fuel and its production involves the release of vast amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas., Previous research has shown that both coal and gas will need to be rapidly replaced by zero carbon alternatives such as solar and wind, or to at least deploy technology that captures emissions, if the world is to avoid more disastrous global heating., The Trump administration, however, has sought to prop up the ailing coal industry in the US and has rolled back Obama-era standards aimed at curtailing pollution from coal-fired power plants., “Particulate pollution from coal still kills thousands of Americans yearly and hundreds of thousands of people worldwide,” said Rob Jackson, a climate and environment expert at Stanford University who wasn’t involved in the study. “Rolling back emissions standards won’t just harm the climate, it will kill people, especially poorer people more likely to live near coal-fired power plants., Thomas Burke, a former Environmental Protection Agency official responsible for clean air, said Burney’s study “provides a new lens for viewing the broad impacts of coal on our health, agriculture and climate”., “Clearly the policies of the current EPA leadership, to turn back the clock and support the coal industry, have broad ranging negative impacts on public health and our environment,” he said.coal power pollution gas saved lives study", "label": 0}, "train-29": {"text": "\nUrgent new ‘roadmap to recovery’ could reverse insect apocalypse\n, Phasing out synthetic pesticides and fertilisers and aggressive emission reductions among series of solutions outlined by scientists, \nPatrick Greenfield, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 11.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 15.15 EST\n\n, The world must eradicate pesticide use, prioritise nature-based farming methods and urgently reduce water, light and noise pollution to save plummeting insect populations, according to a new “roadmap to insect recovery” compiled by experts., The call to action by more than 70 scientists from across the planet advocates immediate action on human stress factors to insects which include habitat loss and fragmentation, the climate crisis, pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species., Phasing out synthetic pesticides and fertilisers used in industrial farming and aggressive greenhouse gas emission reductions are among a series of urgent “no-regret” solutions to reverse what conservationists have called the “unnoticed insect apocalypse”., Insects are crucial to the health of functioning ecosystems that are vital for food production and security.

Other types of insects include herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids and predators that are crucial to ecosystems humans rely on to survive, acting as pest controllers, recycling nutrients and performing other tasks., How do humans harm insects?Habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, invasive species, the climate crisis and over-harvesting are all human-caused issues that put pressure on insects, say experts.

The survival of mankind would be at stake. With no insects to pollinate the crops humans rely on to eat or perform vital functions in ecosystems, humans would be in trouble., What can we do about it?Insect experts have devised a roadmap for conservation and recovery. In the short term, humans must phase out pesticide use, prioritise nature-based farming methods and reduce light, noise and water pollution. In the long term, scientists have called for an international body to monitor the health of insect populations and action taken to help them., Alongside these measures, scientists must urgently establish which herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids, predators and pollinators are priority species for conservation, according to a new paper published in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution. The animals are crucial to the healthy functioning of ecosystems by recycling nutrients, serving as pollinators and acting as food for other wildlife., The paper comes amid repeated warnings about the threat of human-driven insect extinction causing a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, with more than 40% of insect species declining and a third endangered, according to the first worldwide scientific review, published in February 2019., In July 2017, researchers warned human overpopulation and overconsumption were driving the sixth mass extinction event in world history, pointing to the “biological annihilation” of wildlife., Lead author Prof Jeff Harvey of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said: “As scientists, we want to gather all available knowledge and put it to action together with land managers, policymakers and everyone else involved. , “Essentially, we are thinking strategically and this is novel. Now and down the road, all to reverse insect declines., “Most importantly, we hope that end-users and land managers now can use this roadmap in, for instance, farming, habitat management and urban development as a template for true insect recovery.”, The scientists have called on governments to follow the example of Germany, which announced a €100m action plan for insect protection in September 2019, adding that there is a strong consensus among experts that the decline of insects, other arthropods and global biodiversity is a serious threat that society must address., In the short term, the roadmap advocates immediate action on rewilding and conservation programmes, avoiding and mitigating the impact of alien species and prioritising imports that are not produced at the cost of species-rich ecosystems. Enhancing citizen science projects to improve data quality and inform academic study was also deemed a priority., “Most importantly, we should not wait to act until we have addressed every key knowledge gap. We currently have enough information on some key causes of insect decline to formulate no-regret solutions whilst more data are compiled for lesser known taxa and regions and long-term data are aggregated and assessed,” the roadmap states., “Implementation should be accompanied by research that examines impacts, the results of which can be used to modify and improve the implementation of effective measures. Furthermore, such a ‘learning-by-doing’ approach ensures that these conservation strategies are robust to newly emerging pressures and threats. We must act now.”, In the long term, the scientists are calling for the establishment of an international body to document and monitor the effects of the roadmap on insect biodiversity under the auspices of existing bodies such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Public-private partnerships to restore, protect and create new insect habitats and manage threats are also advocated by the roadmap., Coauthors on the roadmap for insect conservation recovery originate from Europe, North America, South and Central America, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Asia. They include biology professor Dave Goulson, known for his books on the ecology of bees and other insects, and scientist Hans de Kroon, renowned for his work on insect biomass decline., In February 2019, analysis published in the journal Biological Conservation found that the total mass of insects had fallen by 2.5% a year for the last 25-30 years, with intensive agriculture the primary driver of falling populations., Light pollution has also emerged as an overlooked driver of plummeting insect populations by luring them to predators, affecting the development of juvenile insects and disrupting light and dark cycles, according to a study published in November 2019. Scientists said insect deaths could be reduced by switching off unnecessary lights., Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresurgent new roadmap to recovery could reverse insect apocalypse aoe", "label": 0}, "train-30": {"text": "\nWestern Australia shark attack victim Gary Johnson was an experienced scuba diver\n, The president of the Esperance Dive Club was attacked off Cull Island, in an area notorious for shark attacks, Australian Associated Press, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 02.23 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 6 Jan 2020 02.09 EST\n\n, An experienced scuba diver killed by a white shark off Western Australia’s southern coast was at home in the ocean and believed if he ever was attacked he would be unlucky, his grieving wife says., Gary Johnson had just entered the water when he was attacked about 1pm on Sunday near Cull Island, close to West Beach in Esperance., His partner Karen Milligan said in a statement on Monday that Johnson was her rock and the world was now a “poorer place” without him., “He was a kind, gentle, strong man,” she said. “He only ever saw the best in people.  “He and I were at home in and on the ocean … we would go out diving in our boat whenever we could, most weekends., “We were always aware of the risks and often told each other that if we were attacked by a shark that would just be unlucky.”, Milligan said Johnson had been completely against shark culling and she still maintained that position.  “We believed that if fish stocks were better protected, then the risk to people in the water would be reduced,” she said., “Gary’s vision was to have a marine park in the Esperance area.”, Milligan put out the mayday alert and was taken to Esperance hospital to be treated for shock., “I raced out and we found a couple of flippers and a sleeve in the water, basically that was about it,” Glenn Quinlivan told reporters., The search for Johnson’s body was continuing on Monday., Esperance Shire president Ian Mickel said Johnson was well-liked in the community., “It’s a real shock to know a person as experienced as Gary has lost his life while he was doing what he loved,” he said., Long-time friend Jaimen Hudson said he was heartbroken for Johnson’s family., “Gary would always ask me about my family and I would do the same.

This pause gives one time to notice small things near at hand and emphasises the differing ways of the rooks who live on St Herbert’s Island on Derwentwater and those in Castle Head wood. The lake rooks go off quietly and purposefully in the half-dark to forage on the high fields and are little seen until they come home to roost after sunset; the woodland ones are about all day going to and from the folds, and enjoying flight for its own sake at noon and in the early afternoon. Today they caught a stately buzzard in their noon-rout and wheeled up with it like black, noisy urchins – quite ignored – until they tired of the game., Their liveliness is one of the few signs of the turning year but the year has turned and 1970 is European Conservation Year. There will be many useful and important events – but need it all be so solemn? Could the countryside not have its fun too? No one ever forgets water in the Lake District (how could they?) but it would be nice, even temporarily, to overlook reservoirs and barrages and remember, say, wells. There are wells all over Britain, and their legends, founded in cult and continued in Christianity, are as old as time. Well-wakings in Cumberland once had a picnic gaiety like the gathering at St Trinian’s when “Spanish juice” was added to the water, or another at Gosforth, in West Cumberland, when wine took the place of “Spanish.” The wakings died out a century ago because of “mischief,” and while I am not asking for “Spanish,” wine, or even mischief, a little gaiety would suit.country diary differing ways of lakeland rooks 1970", "label": 0}, "train-32": {"text": "\nCountry diary: how many Bewick's swans will fly in this January?\n, Amberley Wildbrooks, West Sussex: The international swan census takes place this weekend, but so far I’ve only counted three wintering birds, \nRob Yarham, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, The muddy footpath along the woodland edge is submerged in water, and it’s too deep to be passable. I double back and climb the hill through the woods, my feet sinking into the soft floor of wet brown leaves. The track winds back to the main path, and a higher, drier stretch that looks out across the flooded valley. The pearlescent sky is reflected in the silvery greys of the large expanse of water. Grassy islands and banks emerge in the middle and, sitting on the bare trees that rise over them, are crows and birds of prey, including two red kites and two common buzzards., Thousands of ducks and geese swim and feed. Among a group of paddling Canada geese, shovelers and pintails is a single, newly arrived Bewick’s swan, its head underwater for much of the time as it searches for food. The movements of Sussex’s wintering Bewick’s swans have been fairly well documented. Some individuals have been tracked arriving in the Netherlands from Arctic Russia in November and December, before flying on to arrive at favoured local sites in the south of England, including here in the Arun valley. But the numbers wintering in Sussex have declined in recent years, it is thought because of warmer conditions on the continent further north and the reduction in the overall population., This weekend, on the 11-12 January, volunteers across north-west Europe will record sightings of Bewick’s and whooper swans for the five-yearly international swan census. As well as providing a clearer picture of population numbers, the coordinated count aims to identify important wintering areas and any changes in the habitats used by the birds., Two more gleaming white Bewick’s swans, with yellow triangles both sides of the base of their bills, swim into view and together the three birds paddle around and feed. Eventually, two of them climb out of the water on to a raised patch of ground to preen. A slender, brown bird of prey flaps past – a brown female or immature hen harrier, with its distinctive white rump. It flies fast and low, intent on getting somewhere, either to an area of drier grassland where it can hunt, or to its roost for the night.country diary how many bewicks swans will fly in this january", "label": 0}, "train-33": {"text": "\nWhy Irish data centre boom is complicating climate efforts\n, Surge in processing industry will increase Ireland’s already too high carbon emissions, \nRory Carroll Ireland correspondent, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 00.00 EST\n\n, Inside Digital Realty’s Dublin data centre, racks of shiny black servers throb and whirr as unseen fans cool machines that steadily process unending data., It operates 24 hours a day from the business park, sited on a former orchard, and the data joins a digital torrent in an underground fibre ring network that sweeps around the Irish capital and connects to undersea cables – the physical backbones of the digital world., It is not just for Ireland. This is also how the UK and continental Europe accesses a lot of email, social media, online shopping, Netflix and other internet services. “Everything with the word smart in front of it has a data centre behind it,” said Ben Bryan, Digital Realty’s technical operations manager in Dublin., But there is a catch. The surge in Irish data processing will require significant new energy infrastructure and increase emissions, complicating Ireland’s response to the climate crisis. The cloud can create carbon: it is estimated that when the music video Despacito reached 5bn streamed YouTube views in 2018, the energy consumption was equivalent to powering 40,000 US homes a year (it has now exceeded 6.5bn views)., By 2028 data centres and other large users will consume 29% of Ireland’s electricity, according to EirGrid, Ireland’s state-owned transmission system operator. Worldwide data centres consume about 2% of electricity, a figure set to reach 8% by 2030. Few countries, if any, will match Ireland’s level., It is already Europe’s data centre capital, with Amazon, Google and Microsoft siting operations there. Dozens of centres have opened in recent years, bringing the total to 54, with a combined power capacity of 642MW. Once a leading exporter of floppy discs and CD-Roms, Ireland has successfully transitioned to the big data era., It is just the beginning. With the state’s blessing another 10 centres are under construction, including a €1bn (£845m) Amazon hub in Mulhuddart, west Dublin, that together will add 202MW. Another 31 centres have planning permission, which would add 629MW. There has been one setback: planning approval delays prompted Apple to scrap a planned €850m (£743m) centre last year., “The data centre industry is growing so fast it’s hard to fathom,” said Patrick Bresnihan, a geography professor at Maynooth University in Ireland. “But somehow the tech companies get far less attention than aviation or fossil fuel companies.”, Ireland faces a dilemma. The expanding web of data centres is part of a strategy to anchor tech companies that drive economic growth. They have been designated as “critical infrastructure”, facilitating planning approval. “Data centre presence in Ireland raises our visibility internationally as a technology-rich, innovative economy,” said a spokesperson for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DoBEI)., But the boom will exact a price. Ireland is one of the EU’s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than €250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Missing later targets will trigger steeper fines., A report by the Irish Academy of Engineering (IAE) has estimated data centre expansion will require almost €9bn in new energy infrastructure and add at least 1.5m tonnes to Ireland’s carbon emissions by 2030 – up 13% spike on current electricity sector emissions., Ireland’s data centres have a low profile. They tend to operate from anonymous-looking business parks with high-security perimeter fences and intruder detection alarms. A Google centre has colourful murals but the rest are grey and nondescript, with discreet signage., Digital Realty, whose headquarters is in San Francisco, has a relatively small centre in Profile Park, part of a cluster in west Dublin. Its two data halls are powered by 9MW, a fraction of some neighbours but enough to require an electricity substation., It powers the servers and fans which during winter suck in cool air from outside. If the power – and cooling – stopped the machines would swiftly overheat, said Bryan. That has never happened but just in case there are backup diesel generators on the roof., The electricity came from 100% renewable sources, said Valerie Walsh, a company vice-president. “There is a huge amount of thought to make sure we’re sustainable and do the right thing.”, Google and Amazon representatives also said their Irish data centres were energy efficient and entirely supplied by – or soon would be - renewable energy. Earlier this year Amazon Web Services announced backing for a 91.2MW windfarm in Donegal and a 23.2MW windfarm in Cork., Such deals could act as a catalyst for renewable energy investment, said the DoBEI, citing a 2018 government report., Asked about the estimated 1.5m tonnes of carbon emissions, it replied: “The department is not in a position to comment on the accuracy or otherwise of the estimates of the IAE study, which it is not a party to.”, Bresnihan, the academic, said Ireland’s dependence on big tech companies should not obscure their environmental cost. “If they left Ireland would be in a pretty bad situation but there’s only so long you can put off these contradictions.”why irish data centre boom complicating climate efforts", "label": 0}, "train-34": {"text": "\nBirdwatch: treasured moments as the day, and year, closes\n, Even on a dull December day my local patch yields snatches of song and glimpses of egrets , \nStephen Moss, \n\nTue 7 Jan 2020 16.30 EST\n\n, A spare hour at dusk, on the last day of work before Christmas, and after a wet month I took the chance for a walk around my local patch. As often happens here, I saw virtually nothing for the first half of the walk: a few blackbirds chinking along the wooded drive, the rooks in the rookery by the car park., And then, after dusk had fallen, when it was almost too dark to see, it all kicked off. First, two marsh harriers, floating low over the reedbed; then, no fewer than half a dozen great white egrets, each heading purposefully south to roost on the main Avalon Marshes. These elegant birds arrived here from France just a few years ago, enabled by the warming climate to extend their range northwards. Cetti’s warbler, another relatively recent arrival from continental Europe, wren and robin – the three birds that do sing during the winter – all uttered snatches of song. And as darkness fell, the jink and twist and turn of a male sparrowhawk, shooting across the path in front of me before disappearing into the trees., It made me realise why, even on an unprepossessing day at the end of the year, it’s always worth taking a walk around my local patch.birdwatch treasured moments as the day and year closes", "label": 0}, "train-35": {"text": "\nOne year to save the planet: a simple, surprising guide to fighting the climate crisis in 2020\n, \nOne year to save the planet: a simple, surprising guide to fighting the climate crisis in 2020\n, Veganism might help and it’s always good to avoid flying.

Bushfires have killed more than 20 people in south-eastern Australia and forced thousands more to flee their homes. Floods and storms have left hundreds dead and many more destitute in Argentina, Uruguay, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi. And in the UK, record temperatures were seen last summer and this winter., Last year, people across the world took to the streets to demand goverments act to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Did you watch and wonder what you could do to help the global climate movement?, If so, this year presents a remarkable opportunity. With the 26th Conference of the Parties UN climate conference taking place in Glasgow this November, there has never been a better time to add your voice to those calling for urgent action to end our reliance on fossil fuels, cut greenhouse gases and protect the planet from global heating., At COP 26, world leaders will be under huge pressure to come up with an international, united and effective response to the climate emergency. Those involved in the recent wave of climate action believe much can be done beforehand to ensure nations take effective action. “There is no doubt 2020 is going to be a really big year,” says Kim Bryan, of the US group 350.org.“In Glasgow, nations will be expected to agree formal commitments to tackle climate change. And people pressure is really making a difference.”, A number of Scottish organisations are building their campaigns in the run-up to COP, including Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, a collection of more than 40 civil society organisations. But there have never been so many options for would-be activists, from traditional NGOs such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, to more radical groups such as Extinction Rebellion (XR) and its youth section, the school strikes movement, run by the UK Student Climate Network, and grassroots organisations such as Onca in Brighton or Clean Air for Southall and Hayes. “There is going to be a mixture of mobilisation for the coming year, and hopefully a lot of it will be led by grassroots groups,” says Guppi Bola of Wretched of the Earth, an activist coalition that supports the global south and people of colour seeking climate justice. , With 40% of UK emissions coming from households, the independent Committee on Climate Change says what we do can play an important part in reducing emissions. From choosing renewable energy to heat their home, to improving household insulation and choosing an electric vehicle, individuals can cut their carbon footprint. Reducing your overall consumption – of clothes, household goods or toys – can also help reduce the UK’s carbon emissions. The latest data reveals that in 2016 UK consumption represented 784m tonnes of CO2., You could set up a local Friends of the Earth action group. The charity is supporting those who want to build community action groups to put pressure on councils to adopt climate action plans. The aim is to build upwards to push the government to adopt a national action plan that will put the UK on a path to net-zero emissions by 2045 by tackling transport, heating, energy and agriculture. “This will be the backbone of our campaigning this year,” says Claire Norman of FOE., Extinction Rebellion encourages anyone in an area without a local group to set one up. Creating a Facebook page or hosting a public meeting are ways to start off your group. “The basic idea is to inform and inspire new people and then get them into groups to take on roles and jobs so the whole mobilisation can grow quickly,” says XR., Finding a group that embraces diversity may be hard. Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, has warned of the environmental movement becoming stuck in “a white middle-class ghetto”., That said, Daze Aghaji of XR youth recommends her own organisation, “because we are extremely diverse. We have really worked on this because we know that XR was coming under criticism over lack of diversity. We are creating bonds with activists in the global south, and we are taking on topics that are hard to talk about, like mental health and climate change.”, Bola, meanwhile, says that people of colour should join local groups where they feel comfortable doing so, and that many grassroots groups in metropolitan areas are more diverse and representative of society. , Clare Rodger of the UK Student Climate Network says: “There is more that we could be doing to make sure that everyone is equally valued and listened to. This includes encouraging more boys to get involved in the climate justice movement.”, If you have a unionised workplace, ask your union to get involved. Petition or lobby your company to carry out an audit of its carbon footprint – from its energy emissions and transport to the staff canteen. Then push for it to commit to reducing its carbon emissions, moving to net zero., There are many ways to show concern and to act, says Rodger. Some involve direct action and protest, others do not. “I think people should just do whatever they feel most comfortable doing, whether it is joining a school strike, or lobbying your MP or taking action to lobby your employer at work. What is important is to join the movement in whatever way you can.”, Taking direct action can lead to arrest. Mass arrests, such as those that took place during the XR protests last year, can also be used as a form of disruption. XR provides advice on how an activist can use the criminal justice process, from arrest to prosecution, to raise public and political awareness of the climate emergency. But arrest is not for everyone., But there is so much else to do, away from direct action, that is not often seen, “It is an individual choice for some people, and we will support those people,” said Aghaji. “But there is so much else to do, away from direct action, that is not often seen – for example, there is the education work we do to build the climate movement.”, Change.org says the ability of ordinary people to set up petitions helps to level the playing field. “You no longer need to be a politician or CEO to make change happen,” says a spokesperson. “Anyone can start a petition on Change.org and raise awareness of an issue. Then the people who sign the petition become a community that work together to win the campaign.”, Often petitions focus on a small area relating to climate change or the environment. “Some of the most successful petitions are ‘little big things’ – campaigns to change one tangible part of a wider problem. This paves the way for the public to make change on huge issues like stopping climate change, where it can be hard to know where to start,” the spokesperson adds., Try theyworkforyou.com, which takes data from the UK parliament to show you how your MP voted on issues such as the third runway at Heathrow, fracking, and carbon capture and storage., The Guardian’s polluters project also provides a handy guide to how MPs have voted on key environmental legislation. In the US, 350.org is running a “climate test” to show where presidential candidates stand on key issues., Building pressure to reduce UK emissions to net zero sooner than 2050 – the current government target – and pushing for a carbon tax are key campaign areas. In the UK, transport accounts for a third of all carbon emissions. So you could campaign for policies to reduce transport emissions – for example, through a much earlier ban on diesel and petrol vehicles than the current 2040 deadline, an end to the freeze on fuel duty, or cuts to rail fares. These are political decisions that could speed up change., Fridays for Future is the schools strikes movement Thunberg inspired. According to 350.org, which works with the movement, joining in the school strikes is one of the best ways to support her. The next day of action is 14 February., The global movement inspired in part by the school strikes helped give Thunberg the profile to speak at the UN, says Bryan. “Building this movement, growing it, making sure it has more profile and drives more action is important in the coming year.”, A key month is April, when there will be three days of action across the world, including a global strike and a rebellion led by XR.save the planet guide fighting climate crisis veganism flying earth emergency action", "label": 0}, "train-36": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a hunter on the wing\n, Hardley Staithe, Norfolk: Over and over, the owl attacked the same lens of air just above the grasses, \nMark Cocker, \n\nTue 7 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, The weight of winter cloud seemed to leave the whole landscape slumped in grey, but there was no hint of dullness to the morning. Among the pigeons and partridges and flights of finches were six marsh harriers, five kestrels and two owls. The predators were evenly spread, quartering the marsh or perched aloft and intent, so that I could hardly look in any direction without some returning sense of electric attention. They all seemed to be after voles and, in fact, I saw a kestrel and harrier each take one in turn, while a young heron, neck and beak poised over the field like some ritual dagger, was stalking the same sort of prey. Of them all, however, the hunting short-eared owls were most wonderful., The owl’s long wings were pale buff below, chequered ash-brown above. Their full span levered up and down rhythmically, but the upstroke was whipped so high and hard it installed a brief vacuum beneath each arm, then down softly on to that displaced air settled the downstroke. Over and over, with adjusting tilts to left and right, or when it came clean around to come straight at me in long level glides, the bird attacked the same lens of air just above the grasses., The action was so fluent it seemed automated and strangely at odds with the rest of the organism. For behind those wings, trailing like a loose rudder, were the buff-stockinged feet, while ahead of everything rode the head. It was fixed to a body via an enormous neck whose thickly feathered hood created an encircling bulge about the entire upper body and looked a fulcrum for the whole sweet mechanism., All its fine-tuned kinetics were ultimately at the service of two immense yellow eyes centred in a flattened facial disc. They were ringed in black and beamed down upon the grasses, on to which the bird intermittently collapsed like old clothes. Then the head would rotate back and forth, the eyes swivelling everywhere, and just occasionally I was swallowed too and an owl’s brain drank me down, so that for those moments I was more than an observer to this hunter’s morning.country diary a hunter on the wing", "label": 0}, "train-37": {"text": "Sidney Holt obituary, Sidney Holt, who has died aged 93, aimed to live long enough to save the great whale species from extinction – something he had been fighting for since being appointed to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1961 to give scientific advice on annual catch limits for each hunted species., He managed to curtail the slaughter but did not succeed in halting it until 26 December 2018, when Japan left the International Whaling Commission and announced it would no longer kill whales in Antarctica, at last guaranteeing the great whales a sanctuary where their seriously depleted numbers might continue to recover., Holt’s battle to save the whales began after he had established himself as a world-renowned scientist in the field of fisheries, having co-written a book published in 1957 on how to calculate fish stocks and therefore work out sustainable catches. The book, On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations, was a collaboration with a fellow UK Ministry of Fisheries and Food (Maff) scientist, Ray JH Beverton. It became the must-have textbook for fisheries scientists., Holt had worked out the equations that formed the core of the book while camping on Rannoch Moor in Scotland, waiting for wood ants to return to their nests. He had been sent out on a motorbike to scout for areas of Scotland that could be turned into nature reserves, and out of curiosity began weighing the ants when they set off to forage in the morning. He marked them with tiny spots of green paint so he could identify individuals when they returned and weigh them again., He posted off the fishery equations to his co-author and four years later the ministry published the results, establishing the international reputations of both men., Holt, who had an intense curiosity, believed in spreading his knowledge and had already represented the UK at various international conferences on fishing. Four years before the book was published he was asked by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to run a training course in Istanbul, after which he was recruited to work full time., Holt and his wife, Nan (nee Meadmore), known as Judy, whom he married in 1947, went to live in Rome, and he spent the following 25 years working for the UN. His reputation continued to grow as he produced more than 400 scientific papers and articles. He served as director of the fisheries resources and operations division of the FAO in Rome, secretary of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission and director of Unesco’s marine sciences division in Paris., In 1961, as a part-time additional job, he became one of the so-called “three wise men” – independent scientists advising the IWC, which was intent on devising sustainable limits to catches of great whales. Although he officially retired from the UN in 1979, he continued work to limit the slaughter of whales, first for the IWC until 2002, and then as a scientific adviser to various anti-whaling countries, including the Seychelles and France, as well as environment groups., After retiring from the UN he became first director of the International Ocean Institute in Malta and helped draft the Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982)., He won many accolades for his work on protecting marine mammals, animal welfare and fisheries science, including the Global 500 award of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Blue Planet award of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)., Sidney was born in the East End of London. His father, also Sidney Holt, was a briar-pipe maker, and his mother, Ethel (nee Fryatt), had worked in a confectionery factory. They moved to Colindale and Sidney won a scholarship to Haberdashers’ Aske’s boys’ school before going to Reading University, where he got a first-class degree in biology. He wanted to continue studying but his parents could not afford to support him and he joined Maff, working in its Lowestoft laboratory., Although he began his research life at sea, sewing buttons on plaice and releasing them to determine where they had migrated when they were caught again by fishermen, he was soon in demand elsewhere.

He later discovered he had been labelled a communist for helping two visiting Russians translate their scientific paper into English., Instead of America he worked at Nature Conservancy in Scotland before joining the UN in Rome.,  Holt was proud to have worked for the UN, but it was saving the great whale species that became his passion. He used his scientific, communication and diplomatic skills to turn the IWC from pro-hunting to a conservation body, a process that took decades of dedication., The first great milestone in saving the whales came when a moratorium was introduced in 1984. However, Japan immediately invented “scientific” whaling – killing whales to check their age and the state of the stock – a loophole that allowed it to continue to slaughter the mammals for meat, also exploited by Norway and Iceland., The annual meetings of the IWC were a political battleground in which Holt was ever present, patiently explaining the science and revealing to journalists the “bribes” of fish plants and cash sums used by Japan to get small nations to vote alongside it., As he got older he grew more radical and became a Greenpeace representative, helping to found Greenpeace Italy, advising the IFAW, and finally endorsing the work of the Sea Shepherd organisation, directly confronting the Japanese whaling fleet as it hunted in the designated Antarctic sanctuary., When Japan announced it had stopped “scientific” whaling in the Antarctic the news was hardly reported, but last September, when Holt was physically ailing, a group of prominent whale campaigners from around the world made a pilgrimage to his home in Umbria to celebrate and thank him for his immense contribution to their cause., He met his partner, Leslie Busby, while they were working at Unesco.

After her speech at the Oxford Farming Conference, the hundreds of participants were asked to raise their hands if they were convinced that she would in fact protect their interests against trade partners, including the US. No hands were raised., Rob Percival, head of food and health policy at the Soil Association, said: “Villiers’s suggestion that tariffs could be placed on imports that don’t meet UK standards suggests the government is looking for ways to support UK farming, but such piecemeal measures need to be part of a coherent trade policy, which we are yet to see. This policy and the ensuing legislation must ensure non-regression on environment, food and farming standards, and ensure the UK can continue to raise the bar in response to the climate and nature emergency.”, Villiers refused to back farmers’ demands for an independent trade commission that would rule on whether trade deals met the UK’s standards, but said she would relay their views to her government colleagues and a decision would be made., Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents landowners and rural businesses, said farmers were also concerned about the transition to a new subsidy system. Under plans laid out by Villiers, farmers will be moved over the next seven years from payments based on the amount of land farmed to new subsidies based on agreements by farmers to provide environmental protections., Villers said these agreements would be made with individual farmers based on their circumstances, which would be a huge undertaking, but provided few details of what would be involved., Bridgeman said: “Farmers are already starting to plan for 2021 and beyond, so we need early clarity on how direct payments will be reduced during the whole transition period. There are serious risks to many farming businesses if there are major reductions in direct payments before the introduction of the new environmental land management systems.”, Farmers at the conference also heard about some of the problems with diets in Britain, including obesity and poor health caused by a poor diet. Healthy and environmentally sustainable food should be more widely and cheaply available, said Henry Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain, who is leading the government’s national food strategy., Denise Bentley, founder of the First Love Foundation food bank charity, said the problems went much deeper than blaming people for making poor choices and that poverty was “the elephant in the room” because people simply could not afford healthier food., Campaigners want the government to make bigger interventions in the market for food, to ensure higher nutritional standards in food products.

Arp would have plenty to sell in stores, but more importantly, the bumper harvest would strengthen his bees for their biggest task of the coming year., Like most commercial beekeepers in the US, at least half of Arp’s revenue now comes from pollinating almonds. Selling honey is far less lucrative than renting out his colonies to mega-farms in California’s fertile Central Valley, home to 80% of the world’s almond supply., But as winter approached, with Arp just months away from taking his hives to California, his bees started getting sick. By October, 150 of Arp’s hives had been wiped out by mites, 12% of his inventory in just a few months. “My yard is currently filled with stacks of empty bee boxes that used to contain healthy hives,” he says., This shouldn’t be happening to someone like Arp, a beekeeper with decades of experience. But his story is not unique. Commercial beekeepers who send their hives to the almond farms are seeing their bees die in record numbers, and nothing they do seems to stop the decline., A recent survey of commercial beekeepers showed that 50 billion bees – more than seven times the world’s human population – were wiped out in a few months during winter 2018-19. This is more than one-third of commercial US bee colonies, the highest number since the annual survey started in the mid-2000s., Beekeepers attributed the high mortality rate to pesticide exposure, diseases from parasites and habitat loss. However, environmentalists and organic beekeepers maintain that the real culprit is something more systemic: America’s reliance on industrial agriculture methods, especially those used by the almond industry, which demands a large-scale mechanization of one of nature’s most delicate natural processes., Environmental advocates argue that the huge, commercially driven proliferation of the European honeybees used on almond farms is itself undermining the ecosystem for all bees. Honeybees out-compete diverse native bee species for forage, and threaten the endangered species that are already struggling to survive climate change. Environmentalists argue a better solution is to transform the way large-scale agriculture is carried out in the US., Like all bees, honeybees thrive in a biodiverse landscape. But California’s almond industry places them in a monoculture where growers expect the bees to be predictably productive year after year., Commercial honeybees are considered livestock by the US Department of Agriculture because of the creature’s vital role in food production. But no other class of livestock comes close to the scorched-earth circumstances that commercial honeybees face. More bees die every year in the US than all other fish and animals raised for slaughter combined., “The high mortality rate creates a sad business model for beekeepers,” says Nate Donley, a senior scientist for the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s like sending the bees to war. Many don’t come back.”, California’s $11bn (£8.4bn) almond industry has grown at an extraordinary rate. In 2000, almond orchards occupied 500,000 acres. By 2018 that had more than doubled – almond groves in the Central Valley now blanket an area the size of Delaware, producing 2.3bn lb (1m tonnes) of almonds annually sold around the world., The average American eats 2lb (900g) of almonds every year, more than in any other country. US almond milk sales have grown 250% over the past five years to reach $1.2bn, over four times that of any other plant-based milk, according to a 2018 Nielsen report., “We don’t see a cap on growth at this point, especially with the incredible versatility of almonds in foods,” says Richard Waycott, president and CEO of the Almond Board of California, a not-for-profit advocacy organization representing the majority of farmers., But these enormous orchards can’t function without bees., It wasn’t that long ago that beekeeping was mostly a boutique pursuit of the gentleman apiarist. When European immigrants introduced their own version of agriculture to North America, they also imported the art of beekeeping, along with boxes of Apis mellifera, the domesticated European honeybee., During the 19th and early 20th centuries, beekeepers earned a modest living selling beeswax and honey. But in the late 20th century there was a titanic shift, exemplified by the career of Dennis Arp., Arp, 67, got into beekeeping nearly four decades ago when he established his Mountain Top Honey company in Flagstaff, Arizona. A commanding presence with biceps toned from hoisting heavy bee boxes, Arp is the sort of diligent beekeeper who spends his days driving between apiary sites, and his nights studying online forums, reading articles on the latest mite treatment., When cheap imported honey began cutting into Arp’s profits in the 1980s, he decided to send some of his hives with a beekeeper friend to pollinate almonds in California. A decade later he struck up a deal of his own with an almond grower in California’s Kern county. With that strategic move, Arp joined the growing ranks of migratory beekeepers in the US who still sell honey but mostly travel the country from one pollination site to the next with stacks of bee boxes in tow., In the early 1980s, when Arp was just selling honey, he would lose about 5% of his hives per year to disease or weather conditions. Around 2000, Arp’s bees started dying in greater numbers., First, he experienced a nearly 100% loss of his hives from an infestation of tracheal mites. Then he had to cope with the intrusion of Africanized “killer” bees. And finally, what he still considers the bane of his business, a parasitic mite called Varroa destructor literally sucked the life out of his bees. The mite feeds on the bee’s plump body, destroying the insect’s immune system and other vital functions. If Arp doesn’t apply regular chemical treatments for the mites, his colonies will die., Now Arp finds himself in a vicious circle: he is constantly battling to keep enough bees alive to meet the requirements of his almond contract. But if he was not pollinating almonds, maybe his bees would be healthier., This year Arp’s bees, like more than two-thirds of the United States’ commercial honeybee population, will spend February in the toxic chemical soup of California’s Central Valley, fertilizing almonds one blossom at a time., Pesticides are used for all kinds of crops across the state, but the almond, at 35m lb a year, is doused with greater absolute quantities than any other. One of the most widely applied pesticides is the herbicide glyphosate (AKA Roundup), which is a staple of large-scale almond growers and has been shown to be lethal to bees as well as cause cancer in humans. (The maker, Bayer-owned Monsanto, denies the cancer link when people use Roundup at the prescribed dosage. So far this year three US courts have found in favour of glyphosate users who developed forms of lymphoma; thousands more cases are pending.), On top of the threat of pesticides, almond pollination is uniquely demanding for bees because colonies are aroused from winter dormancy about one to two months earlier than is natural. The sheer quantity of hives required far exceeds that of other crops – apples, America’s second-largest pollination crop, use only one-tenth the number of bees. And the bees are concentrated in one geographic region at the same time, exponentially increasing the risk of spreading sickness., “Bees are exposed to all kinds of diseases in California,” says Arp. “There can be hundreds of thousands of hives from multiple beekeepers in one staging area. It is like letting your bees go into a singles bar and then they have unprotected sex.”, The almond business has been good to Arp – last February, for instance, he installed 1,500 of his hives in one grower’s orchard at $200 per hive – so he is reluctant to make a direct connection between the constant health challenges with his bees and the time spent every spring in the almond groves. “The bees like working on the almonds,” says Arp. “But it obviously exposes them to risks.”, Now he routinely loses 30% or more of his bees a year, mirroring national statistics. In any other industry, the death of a third of your workforce would cause an international outcry – but this staggering loss is now considered the normal cost of doing business., “The bees in the almond groves are being exploited and disrespected,” says Patrick Pynes, an organic beekeeper who teaches environmental studies at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. “They are in severe decline because our human relationship to them has become so destructive.”, When the phenomenon called colony collapse disorder was first identified in 2006, after a record number of honeybees mysteriously disappeared or died outside their hives, it was linked to a variety of factors including loss of habitat and climate change. But the primary culprit was pesticides. Researchers found that a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids was especially lethal to bees., Last May, the EPA pulled a dozen “neonics” from the market following a successful lawsuit brought by beekeepers and environmental groups. But there are many chemicals that are not labeled as bee toxic, even though they can make bees sick and weaken their immune systems. While bees may survive the pollination season, they may not last the winter or may take back substances that gradually poison the entire colony., Those on the almond growers’ side acknowledge there is a huge problem. “The bee mortality rate is too high and is unacceptable,” says the entomologist Bob Curtis, a pollination consultant for the Almond Board of California. “It is only because of the hard work and creativity of beekeepers that almond growers have gotten the bees they need.”, The almond board’s “best practice” guidelines encourage beekeepers to spend as little time in California’s Central Valley as possible. Honeybees can travel up to three miles in search of varied forage, so even if the almond grower is doing everything right to protect a pollination investment, the cotton or grape farmer down the road may be spraying bee-toxic chemicals on crops., Even as almond production has steadily ramped up for decades, the number of commercial hives in the US has remained at a steady 2.7m colonies since the early 2000s. With all the challenges beekeepers face, just maintaining the bare minimum is a struggle., One coping strategy pursued by the almond industry has been to  breed almond varieties that require only one hive per acre to pollinate, instead of two. And last January, a pollinator protection law went into effect in California as part of the state’s “Bee Where” initiative. For this program, beekeepers are required to register the location of their hives with the county’s agricultural commissioner and farmers must notify the commissioner in advance of any plans to spray pesticides., Even so, the costs beekeepers incur trying to keep their bees alive are constantly rising. Arp has spent approximately $50,000 in the past year buying new hives to compensate for the 35% colony loss he experienced last year. He also spends at least $50,000 a year on mite treatments, not to mention other more aggressive measures the industry is taking just to maintain the status quo. These include splitting robust hives in half, introducing mail-order queens to new hives and fattening bees on corn syrup or on simulated pollen substances called “pollen patties”., Experts say that simply working around the pesticide problem isn’t enough and that farming itself must be changed from the ground up., Hope is being found in a new certification program that, similar to “organic” or “fair trade” labels, will help consumers choose products that have been made with bee-friendly methods., The “Bee Better” certification program, launched in 2017 by the not-for-profit Xerces Society, introduces biodiversity into almond groves to naturally control pests and nourish honey bees. Xerces is working with almond growers to plant California wildflowers, mustard and clover in between the rows of trees and native flowering hedges along the perimeter of the orchard – a kind of eco-friendly fence to keep bees in the orchard., The program scored a victory when Häagen-Dazs ice cream became the first food company to carry products with the Bee Better seal. The company’s bee-friendly vanilla milk chocolate almond bar was rolled out in December at Costco, Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club, with three more bee-friendly almond ice cream flavors to be available in early 2020., Letting nature take its course is nothing new for 81-year old Glenn Anderson. He is the first and still one of the few organic almond growers in California’s San Joaquin Valley. His 40-year-old orchard is small – just 20 acres – and has always been chemical free., “We don’t have pests; we have biodiversity,” says Anderson, who primarily sells directly to individual customers through his Anderson Almonds company. Unlike large industrial almond farms that strip the orchard ground bare to more efficiently treat for insects and fungi, Anderson allows a rich understory to grow, which naturally nourishes the soil and strengthens the trees., Anderson hires a “beekeeper hobbyist” from northern California every spring to install about 20 hives in his orchard. “We have the opposite of colony collapse at my farm,” says Anderson. “My beekeeper brings weak hives down that he wants to recharge on my property.”, Anderson says the tradeoff for not using pesticides is that his annual crop yield is lower – typically about 10,000 pounds – and he keeps his orchard small in order to manage its wildness. “I’m averse to an expansion model,” he says. “It doesn’t suit me much.”, And as for industrial-grown almonds? “They taste like cardboard,” he says., Back in Arizona, Dennis Arp and his son Adam are just trying to make it through the next few months with as many healthy bees as possible., There are days when the costs seem overwhelming, and Arp wonders if he should hang up his honey-stained bee suit. But beekeeping is what he knows best, and he wants to pass the business on to his son., “I don’t know how we will pull it off yet,” he says. “But we will make it work.”, • This article was amended on 8 and 10 January 2020 to clarify how the almond industry is breeding nuts that require fewer hives-per-acre to pollinate.

Its stubby tail, cocked and giving exaggerated flicks, may have been interpreted by the swan as a baton of provocation. The big bully, 30 times the moorhen’s weight, mounted the bank and rushed towards his ill-matched opponent. But the swan was not fleet of waddling foot. The moorhen made a side-stepping scamper for the water and there it slipped into tall vegetation with the ease of a born skulker. For a minute or so, the weeds were complicit in its concealment, offering not so much as a twitch of betrayal.

BlackRock has directly voted against multiple shareholder resolutions brought by Climate Action 100+., BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink’s annual letter to investors, expected ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos on 21 January, has previously called on companies to take more action on the climate crisis. BlackRock has faced protests from environmental campaigners, who have accused the company of hypocrisy for routinely voting against shareholder motions directing boards to take action on the climate crisis., A spokesperson for the investment giant said: “BlackRock has become a signatory to Climate Action 100+. This is a natural progression of the work our Investment Stewardship team has done to date. We believe evidence of the impact of climate risk on investment portfolios is building rapidly and we are accelerating our engagement with companies on this critical issue.”, BlackRock is understood to have been considering joining the climate crisis investor coalition for a while and its membership could signal a transformation in how the firm uses its influence to hold the planet’s biggest polluters to account., Fiona Reynolds, the chief executive of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a UN-backed investment group, said: “In joining CA100+, BlackRock is responding to the demands of its asset-owner clients and other groups globally that they take meaningful action to address climate change.”, Last year, an investigation by the Guardian revealed that BlackRock’s retail investment portfolio in fossil fuel companies totals more than $87bn and that it is the largest investor in some of the biggest polluters on the planet., Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners, which runs the pensions for British clergy, said: “The Church Commissioners warmly welcome BlackRock to Climate Action 100+ and look forward to working together as we seek commitments from the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to achieve emissions reductions in line with the goals of the Paris agreement., “We know from our previous engagement with companies on climate change just how important BlackRock’s support can be for moving companies forward. This is a hugely welcome decision by BlackRock and a step-change for the entire investment industry as it collectively grapples ever more seriously with the financial implications of climate change.”, It is thought that BlackRock staff have become increasingly uncomfortable with the criticism from activists and other investors, including the British hedge fund manager Sir Chris Hohn, who last month accused BlackRock of “greenwashing”., In December, the American investors Boston Trust Walden and Mercy Investment Services submitted shareholder proposals to BlackRock, a publicly listed company in New York, calling on it to use its votes to pressure companies to align with climate targets., Timothy Smith, the director of shareowner engagement on the environment at Boston Trust Walden, said he hoped BlackRock’s decision to join the group would prompt other major asset managers such as State Street to start voting on environmental issues., BlackRock has previously argued that its influence is better used in engaging with company managers over environmental issues, rather than exercising their often considerable voting power.

The Adam Smith Institute recently released a paper on the topic that made many of the same points as George Monbiot (Lab-grown food will end farming – and save the planet, Journal, 8 January)., One overlooked benefit of lab-grown food is that it may help the UK tackle the crisis in housing affordability. As farming is superseded by precision fermentation, the significant amount of land currently used for livestock farming (including parts of the green belt) will be freed up for development in places that people actually want to live., However, we’d take a different lesson from the promise of lab-grown meat. Free-market environmentalism and harnessing the power of innovative technologies – supported by market-based measures like a border-adjusted carbon tax – can successfully tackle the problem of manmade climate change without fundamentally uprooting the way we run society. Saving the planet doesn’t have to cost us the earth.Daniel PryorAdam Smith Institute, • There are fundamental reasons why the Solar Foods system that George Monbiot refers to can’t compete with plants for sustainable food production., The supply of minerals for bacteria has to be assembled chemically, with all the chemical industry’s environmental downsides. By contrast, plant roots pull the right minerals in the right proportions out of mixed-up traces in the environment, using solar energy to fuel selective concentration at no cost, generating no heat or chemical pollution and requiring no purified water., The machinery by which plants acquire raw materials is itself built by the plant using solar energy in a non-polluting process, not made in a factory. Likewise, the light-energy-trapping machinery of plants is assembled on a planetary scale, with none of the unwelcome by-products of heat and chemical pollution associated with the fabrication of solar cells and wind turbines, and with the generation of hydrogen from water by electricity., The claim that “the hydrogen pathway used by Solar Foods is about 10 times as efficient as photosynthesis” is meaningless if we’re not told which aspects of the two processes are being compared., Unlike food from plants, no industrially generated food could provide the right mix of dietary constituents essential for health, such as balanced vitamins, minerals and bulk fibre. Supplying these as additives cancels any advantage of electric food. Plants are still the only source of food with long-term sustainability.David E HankeCambridge, • There is much food for thought in George Monbiot’s paean to precision fermentation. He has undoubtedly made the case that agricultural business as usual is not an option. However, his techno-utopianism needs to come with a hefty side order of the precautionary principle., He acknowledges the likely impact on the agricultural sector, arguing that governments should “help farmers into other forms of employment” (that worked out well for the miners and steelworkers), and that “strong anti-trust laws” will limit the commercial rapaciousness of the new producers (ditto the digital giants and fossil fuel companies). Millions of people globally grow, hunt or raise food not to make money, but to feed their families. Where will they get the cash to buy the new stuff? The science may seem simple, but the politics is a minefield., On top of that we are talking about food, not fuel. Vitamin supplements are less effective for health and wellbeing than a varied, mostly plant-based diet. Will foods based on individual proteins meet all our dietary requirements as well as the complex foods we have evolved to consume? What will be the impact on our gut microbiomes? Or our immune systems? Taste, smell, colour and texture all play a part in palatability: enjoyment is a critical part of our food psychology. No doubt the food processing industry will rise to the challenge of making farmfree food fun, but it could take decades., A rapid switch to such foods would be a massive experiment on the global public: there would need to be clinical trials. We will not reap the potential advantages if the consequences are not fully explored.Georgina FerryOxford, • Globally, over 1.3 billion people rely on livestock farming for their livelihoods, either as farmers or as part of the livestock food supply chain. Meat and dairy have known health benefits, and consumption of animal-based food during early life has been linked with lower levels of malnutrition and improved health outcomes., In many ways, British farming is the envy of the world, with high levels of sustainability and sensible land use – for example, most sheep are raised on land that could not be used for any other purpose – and the National Farmers’ Union has committed to the sector being carbon neutral by 2040., It is important to acknowledge that certain types of livestock farming may have issues with sustainability and climate change. But it is not true of all farming systems; and the issues that do exist are being dealt with using the latest research into genetics and biotechnology – for example, recent research has shown that certain types of seaweed can reduce methane emissions from cattle to close to zero., High-profile movements such as EAT-Lancet and Veganuary gain widespread press coverage, yet the fact that the World Health Organization rejected the EAT-Lancet recommendations was largely unreported, and a recent analysis of sales data showed that Veganuary in 2019 was not associated with a reduction in meat and dairy sales. Farmer data also shows that increased sales of alternative milks have not seen a corresponding reduction in dairy sales., The global food system, consumer choices and climate change are incredibly complex issues, and anyone who proposes simple solutions is almost certainly not in possession of all the relevant facts and data. Livestock are an important part of humanity’s future food needs.Prof Mick WatsonUniversity of Edinburgh, • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com, • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters, • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

The researchers concentrated their efforts on the islands of Taliabu and Peleng due to their likely high biodiversity because of their genetic isolation over the last few million years, revealed by using sea-depth analysis of the deep water channels in the archipelago., Nine of the 10 new forms were discovered on Peleng and Taliabu. The new species identified in the study led by Frank Rheindt at National University of Singapore include the Peleng fantail, the Peleng leaf warbler, the Taliabu grasshopper warbler, the Taliabu myzomela and the Taliabu leaf warbler., The new sub-species include the Togian jungle flycatcher, the Banggai mountain leaftoiler, the Taliabu snowy-browed flycatcher, the Taliabu island thrush and the Sula mountain leaftoiler., The findings mark the largest number of new species identified from such a small geographically confined region in more than 100 years., Approximately 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean are believed to await formal scientific description, but researchers fear that much of the world’s biodiversity is at risk of disappearing before it can be identified., Although the new species and subspecies have only just been formally identified, researchers warned that rampant forest destruction on the islands caused by logging and forest fires driven by the climate crisis threaten the survival of the birds., “It’s a real surprise to see that in the 21st century there’s still a place on Earth, a relatively limited area, where there are five new subspecies and five news species of birds to be found,” said Prof Rheindt. “It goes to show that there are still many areas on Earth that are underexplored., “In this era of environmental crisis, the year 2019 has shown that we have entered a critical stage. We will lose a lot of biodiversity in the future and we have limited resources to conserve what we have. How are we to conserve our biodiversity if we don’t know where it is? We really need a new push for biodiversity discovery and I hope that this study will provide the impetus for that.”, Rheindt first visited some of the islands in the study while on a solo exploring trip in 2009, returning four years later with a field permit from the Indonesian government and a research team. The majority of the birds, nine of the 10, were discovered on the little-explored highlands of the Indonesia islands, which were difficult to access., “The islands I visited are separated from Sulawesi by deep seas and that’s an incredibly important point, because the depth of the sea is a very important factor in how much endemism – species that are not shared with any other place on Earth – we can expect on an island. , “Every time there is an ice age, the global sea level recedes by up to 120m. All of these places that we see as islands today are not really islands. But the islands I chose for this exploration are true islands in that they have never been connected to Sulawesi because deep sea separates them. Hence, you might expect a lot of special species there that are not found anywhere else on Earth.”, In the last 20 years, only 161 new species of birds have been found worldwide, with even fewer in restricted geographic areas. There are roughly 11,000 recognised bird species, yet it is believed many more remain to be discovered. , Of the new species, the Peleng fantail is identifiable by the distinct black scaling below it black breast patch, its clean white throat and unique courtship vocalisation. The Taliabu grasshopper warbler, also conspicuous for its vocalisations, has fine dusky speckling which increases toward its breast and lower throat. The scarlet-bodied Taliabu myzomela inhabits forest canopy and was photographed feeding at flowers. The Taliabu leaf warbler, which has been scientifically named after a former Indonesian environment minister, is most notable for its entirely lemon underparts. Finally, the Peleng leaf warbler is identifiable by its lack of both a central crown stripe and wingbars, and its lemon-yellow underparts contrasting with a white throat., Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresflycatchers and fantails new songbird species discovered on tiny islands indonesia aoe", "label": 0}, "train-44": {"text": "\nWhite House unveils plan for major projects to bypass environmental review\n, Plan would help Trump administration advance projects held up over global heating concerns such as the Keystone XL oil pipeline, Reuters, \n\nThu 9 Jan 2020 13.52 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 9 Jan 2020 09.56 EST\n\n, The Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a plan to speed permitting for major infrastructure projects like oil pipelines, road expansions and bridges., It is one of the biggest deregulatory actions of the president’s tenure and comes at the cost of greatly narrowing the use of one of the country’s landmark environmental laws, especially assessments of how developments could exacerbate the climate crisis., Donald Trump is proposing changes that could allow projects ranging from oil pipelines to mines to move forward with far less federal review of their impact on the environment., The plan, released by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), would help the administration advance big energy and infrastructure projects, such as the Keystone XL oil pipeline or roads, bridges and federal buildings., “For the first time in over 40 years today we are issuing a new rule under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to completely overhaul the dysfunctional bureaucratic system that has created these massive obstructions,” Trump said at the White House on Thursday., The proposal to update how NEPA, the 50-year bedrock federal environmental law, is implemented as part of Trump’s broader actions to cut regulations and oversight, a huge rollback effort that has dismayed and enraged environmentalists., Trump on proposed NEPA rollback: \"This is just the beginning. We will not stop until our nation's gleaming new infrastructure has made America the envy of the world again. It used to be the envy of the world, and now we're like a third world country. It's really sad.\", “This proposal affects virtually every significant decision made by the federal government that affects the environment,” said the interior secretary, David Bernhardt, a former fossil fuels lobbyist., The proposed rule says federal agencies would not need to factor in the “cumulative impacts” of a project, which could include its impact on climate change, making it easier for major fossil fuel projects to sail through the approval process and avoid legal challenges., A statement from the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) president, Gene Karpinski, said: “President Trump is trying yet again to sell out the health and wellbeing of our children and families to corporate polluters. This misdirected proposal to change the implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act is one of the most egregious actions the Trump administration has taken to limit the federal government’s response to climate change yet.”, He warned the implications for access to clean air and clean water and for public input “could be dire”., The proposal would also put one federal agency in charge of overseeing the review process, instead of giving multiple agencies oversight of the process and set a two-year deadline for environmental impact studies to be completed and a one-year deadline for less rigorous environmental assessments., Trump’s efforts to cut regulatory red tape have been praised by the industry. But they have so far largely backfired by triggering waves of lawsuits that the administration has lost in court, according to a running tally by the New York University School of Law’s Institute for Policy Integrity., Over the last few years, federal courts have ruled that NEPA requires the federal government to consider a project’s carbon footprint in decisions related to leasing public lands for drilling or building pipelines., Other proposed changes include widening the categories of projects that can be excluded from NEPA altogether., According to CEQ, the average length of a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement is currently 600 pages and takes 4.5 years to conclude. US federal agencies prepare approximately 170 such assessments per year., Trump, a commercial real estate developer before becoming president, frequently complained that the NEPA permitting process took too long., “It’s big government at its absolute worst,” Trump said of NEPA., Some of the country’s biggest industry groups, including the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, also have complained about lengthy permitting delays., Environmental groups warned the plan will remove a powerful tool to protect local communities from the adverse impacts of a hastily designed and reviewed project., “Today’s destructive actions by Trump, if not blocked by the courts or immediately reversed by the next president, will have reverberations for decades to come,” said Rebecca Concepcion Apostol, US program director at Oil Change International, an environmental group., The plan will go through a public comment period before being finalized., Environmental groups are expected to challenge the final proposal.white house projects permits climate impact plan", "label": 0}, "train-45": {"text": "Quorn to be first major brand to introduce carbon labelling, Carbon footprint data will help customers understand environmental impact of food, Quorn is to become the first major brand to introduce carbon labelling on its products., The new labels, aimed at helping consumers understand the environmental impact of their shopping, will start appearing on some products from June and on the entire Quorn range by next year., From Thursday, the “farm to shop” carbon footprint data, certified by the Carbon Trust, will be available online for Quorn’s 30 best-selling products., Quorn claims to be the first meat-free food manufacturer to achieve third-party certification of its carbon footprint figures – via the Carbon Trust – which is being integrated into its own food labelling., It says that in 2018 its products enabled savings of 200,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent compared with meat. The greenhouse gas impact of mycoprotein – the fungi-based protein used in Quorn products – is 90% lower than beef., The most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet revealed that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way in which consumers can reduce their environmental impact, with animal agriculture a significant and fast-growing source of global greenhouse gas emissions., But while Quorn’s products may now be part of a booming industry of meat alternatives – and a key ingredient in Greggs’ new vegan steak bake – that has not stemmed criticism that they are heavily processed and a far cry from natural, plant-based foods., Peter Harrison, chief commercial officer of Quorn Foods, said: “This is about giving people the information needed to make informed decisions about the food they eat and the effect it has on our planet’s climate – in the same way that nutrition information is clearly labelled to help inform decisions on health.”, Manufacturers are stepping up efforts to give consumers more information about the environmental impact of their products, despite previous attempts ending in failure. The UK’s largest retailer Tesco, for example, dropped its plan to label all its products with their carbon footprint, after promising “a revolution in green consumption”, blaming the work involved and other supermarkets for failing to follow its lead., Carbon Trust research in 2019 found that two-thirds of consumers support the idea of a recognisable carbon label to demonstrate that products have been made with a commitment to measuring and reducing their carbon footprint.quorn to be first major brand to introduce carbon labelling", "label": 0}, "train-46": {"text": "\nNational Trust to plant 20 million trees in UK over next decade\n, Plan to cover area 1.5 times size of Manchester is part of goal to achieve net zero emissions, PA Media, \n\nThu 9 Jan 2020 07.12 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 9 Jan 2020 15.30 EST\n\n, The National Trust is planning to plant 20 million trees over the next decade as part of efforts to achieve net zero emissions by 2030., The organisation made the announcement, which it says will cost £90m-100m, on Thursday to mark its 125th anniversary., By the end of the decade, it says the new trees and natural regeneration of woods will cover more than 18,000 hectares (44,000 acres), an area one and a half times the size of Manchester. It will mean that 17% of the land the National Trust looks after will be wooded, up from 10%., The focus will be on planting on farmland – including in upland areas – that the trust owns, rather than in country estates, but the director general, Hilary McGrady, said the National Trust would be working with farmers to deliver the targets., The charity says a similar level of tree cover is needed nationwide to meet government targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions., Other initiatives announced by the trust include maintaining peat bogs, investing in more renewable energy and cutting its carbon footprint., Efforts will focus on the National Trust’s own pollution, but McGrady acknowledged the impact of visitors, many of whom travel by car to the organisation’s properties., She said the trust was measuring the impact of visitor emissions and suggesting ways to encourage more sustainable transport., The charity, which was founded in the 19th century to protect and care for natural and historic places, plans to work with other organisations to create “green corridors” that connect people in urban areas to nature., “As Europe’s biggest conservation charity, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to fight climate change, which poses the biggest threat to the places, nature and collections we care for,” McGrady said., “People need nature now more than ever.

She has endured bouts of dizziness, nausea and difficulty breathing from applying potent chemical straighteners, and regularly deals with distraught clients suffering alopecia and painful blisters after using dyes and lotions specifically marketed to African Americans., “I try to find out online what’s in the products, but the government should be doing more to keep us safe and keep dangerous chemicals out of cosmetics,” said Graves, 34, at a salon in Harlem. “There should be clear warnings on the labels, we need more information.”, The risks are very real. A new landmark study that tracked almost 47,000 American women over eight years has found that using permanent hair dye increases a black woman’s risk of breast cancer by 45%, compared to an increased risk of 7% in white women., The more frequently women colored their hair, the greater the risk, rising to 60% for black women who used permanent dyes at least every five to eight weeks. Prior studies on the link between hair dye use and cancer had been inconsistent., It’s not certain why, but several studies suggest that cosmetic products specifically designed for use by black women and children contain more chemicals that disrupt the endocrine or hormonal system than products aimed at white women. Disrupting the endocrine system – which regulates reproduction, metabolism, sleep, tissue function and growth and development – can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, reproductive problems, developmental and neurological disorders. The way dye is applied and differences in hair texture and absorption could also play a role., Hair products sold in the US contain more than 5,000 chemicals, including aromatic amines in dyes that can cause DNA mutations, parabens in hair lotions that are linked to reproductive and hormonal problems and known carcinogens such as formaldehyde, which are used in embalming fluids and some popular hair smoothing or straightening products., But information about toxic chemicals is not easy to find. Manufacturers are not federally required to list ingredients on professional salon products., In the EU, at least 1,300 chemicals are banned or restricted in cosmetics such as shampoos, soaps, dyes and nail polish, while the US has outlawed or curbed only 11., The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, is the first to analyze the link between chemical hair straighteners and breast cancer since the introduction of so-called Brazilian keratin treatments, which contain up to 11.5% formaldehyde, to the global market in the 2000s., The researchers found that regardless of race, using hair straighteners at least every five to eight weeks increased the risk of breast cancer by 31%. About 74% of black women reported using chemical straighteners compared to only 3% of white women., “Black women straighten their hair to assimilate,” said Amelia Govan, 31, a sales rep who as a teenager straightened her hair every month. “We have to fit in – you never see black women with braids working in corporate.”, “It’s popular with African American women, who still associate curly hair with being ugly,” said Graves, whose current salon does not use Brazilian keratin treatments on safety grounds. “That stuff makes you sick, it made my eyes and throat burn. It should be banned.”, Graves’ mother has used chemical straighteners all her life and is currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer; several other relatives have had the disease. “I need to know what’s in the products, as I’m already high-risk,” she said. “My clients are increasingly worried about the dangers.”, Breast cancer is an unequal disease. Almost one in three African American women diagnosed with breast cancer dies – a 40% higher mortality rate than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control., The reasons for the disparities are not fully understood, but black women are more likely to be diagnosed later, and with aggressive tumors. African Americans are also disproportionately exposed to high rates of carcinogens and other dangerous chemicals from polluting fossil fuel plants and factories – and toxic cosmetics. , The global beauty industry is huge: in 2017, the cosmetics products market was worth $532bn and is expected to grow 50% by 2023. Last year in the US, consumers could choose from 2,727,847 lines of cosmetic imports from 177 countries. African Americans spent $473m on haircare in 2017, accounting for almost 9% of sales., But standards and regulations vary hugely across the world., The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not required to approve or review the safety of cosmetic products and ingredients, other than color additives. In fact, participation in many FDA regulatory mechanisms, such as product registration and recall, is completely voluntary for manufacturers., In 2018, for instance, the FDA issued a warning about hair smoothing products containing formaldehyde, but was powerless to recall or ban them., The beauty industry says the onus should be on consumers, not manufacturers., “People have been told that these straighteners are not a good idea, industry should not be held responsible if they choose not to pay attention to recommendations,” said Ken Marenus, president of the industry group Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors (ICMAD). He insists that most US manufacturers already follow international standards, but agrees that regulations needs to be updated., The current standards are ineffective and inadequate, and it’s especially bad for black women,  “The current standards are ineffective and inadequate, and it’s especially bad for black women because products marketed to them are the most toxic,” said Janet Nudelman, director of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners’ campaign for safe cosmetics, which wants American consumers to be protected like those in Europe., The congressional energy and commerce committee is currently considering legislation which would overhaul cosmetics regulation and could vastly expand FDA powers., The most ambitious bill on the table is proposed by the Illinois congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, and includes provisions designed to protect “highly exposed and vulnerable populations” including salon workers and women of color., The bill would immediately ban 12 toxic ingredients such as formaldehyde, parabens, lead compounds and coal tar dye, and includes federal money for research into chemicals linked to adverse health effects among women and girls of color and the marketing of those products, as well as support research to develop safer alternative ingredients., ., In Harlem, consumers and stylists want more information, and better protection from toxins., Hairstylist Astou Sow, 40, who is originally from Senegal but lived in France before moving to the US, said: “In Europe they care much more about quality, safety and good health. Here it’s mostly about business and money.”black women hair products chemicals risks", "label": 0}, "train-48": {"text": "\nFactcheck: are national parks 'locked up' and more vulnerable to bushfires?\n, The myth that not enough has been done to manage bushland to mitigate bushfire risk has persisted, \nLisa Cox, \n\nFri 10 Jan 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 10 Jan 2020 14.02 EST\n\n,  As disastrous bushfires continue to grip much of the country, causing loss of lives and homes, claims persist that not enough has been done to manage bushland to mitigate fire risk., One frequent claim is that the “locking up” of national parks has somehow contributed to the increased bushfire risk this season, rather than prolonged dry and hot weather and the influence of climate change., The New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, used this language in November, arguing that the fires showed the “locking up” of bushland and “green-left ideology” had failed. In the Australian newspaper this week, the climate change denier Maurice Newman wrote that entries to parks were commonly “blocked by boulders or chains and padlocks” and fire trails were “so overgrown that a sign identifying them is all that distinguishes them from the rest of the forest”., Ross Bradstock is the director of the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong., He says the use of this language in relation to national parks is a “very tired and very old conspiracy that is always regurgitated and it’s always found to be wanting in the wash-up after the fires”., National parks are sometimes physically chained or gated, for reasons such as preventing 4WDs from entering and damaging tourist trails. At other times parks may be closed for the safety of the public during bushfires., To say the fires are due to national parks being locked up would be an incorrect statement., In some parks, there are seasonal closures to ensure roads don’t become eroded and damaged during the winter., None of this prevents fire crews from entering parks. The NSW Rural Fire Service says local trucks often have keys to allow them access., “To say the fires are due to national parks being locked up would be an incorrect statement,” an RFS spokesman says., The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service says some fire trails are secured by gates if they are in an area where there is known to be a high risk of arson., “All of these trails remain accessible to emergency services,” a spokesman says. “The RFS, along with other emergency services, has direct access to all NPWS fire trails.”, A lot of Australia’s national parks occupy large areas of land that cover remote bushland. There are mapped networks of roads for activities including fire management, other types of park management and recreation., Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management in Victoria, says that since 2017 more than 6,935km of access roads have been “improved or maintained” in public reserves in that state. Another 2,795km are planned for 2019-20. This work keeps trails clear for emergency crews during bushfires, and for visitors., “Any claim that the Victorian government has locked up national parks is just not true,” Hardman says. “We’ve got strategic fire networks that are mapped and maintained.”, Bradstock lives near the edge of national park in the NSW Blue Mountains, where fires have torn through massive amounts of bushland., “I don’t see any overgrown trails,” he says. “As a matter of fact, where I am at the moment, the crews have used these trails to put containment in which has been fantastically successful.”, A separate line of argument links with the debunked claims that opposition to hazard reduction burns has somehow contributed to the national disaster, suggesting that management of national parks generally has contributed to the devastation., The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service says it undertook 75% of all hazard reduction burning in the state over the past four years. This includes 137,500 ha of hazard reduction last year, with a five-year rolling average target of 135,000 ha., Hazard reduction burning is highly dependent on weather conditions. In 2019, the prolonged drought and heat has reduced the ability to safely carry out hazard reduction burns in some areas. The window in which to safely conduct this kind of fuel management is narrowing because of the effects of climate change., In Victoria, Hardman says, “we planned to burn 246,396 hectares of public land in 2019, but were unable to do so because it would have been unsafe”., He says, based on advice from emergency services agencies and communities, and taking into account the longer bushfire season, fuel reduction was carried out across 142,078 hectares of public land., All fuel management in the state, including hazard reduction burning and mechanical work such as slashing and mowing, is done on a risk-based approach rather than a hectare-based target., It is informed by members of an expert scientific panel on fuel management that advised the 2009 Victoria bushfires royal commission. It is getting harder to find enough days for safe hazard reduction burning., “The suggestion we’re not prepared to undertake planned burns is wrong and anyone claiming it is either misinformed or deliberately spreading misinformation,” Hardman says., The purpose of national parks is to protect Australia’s unique flora and fauna and items of cultural heritage. Experts say that will become more crucial after this disaster., National parks are also an important drawcard for tourists, both domestically and from overseas., There have been calls from the timber industry for more logging and thinning in national parks. David Lindenmayer, a landscape ecology expert from the Australian National University, says this would actually increase the bushfire risk and make parks less safe., He says logging makes forests more prone to “crown-scorching” fires that get into the tree canopy and burn at higher severity, and that studies have found thinning increases fire risk by elevating fuel loads, drying the understorey and increasing wind incursion., “The notion that thinning will make them less fire prone is garbage,” he says., Lindenmayer says he is a “strong believer” that national parks need to be managed., “It’s really important that the investment in national parks brings more people to these areas,” he says. “It’s the reason a lot of people come to Australia.”, The NSW Parks and Wildlife service says locals visit national parks 60m times a year, and this is expected to grow., Visits have also grown in Victoria, from 42.33m in 2016-17 to 49.63m in 2018-19., It should go without saying, but the millions of hectares burned across the country so far this season are not restricted to national parks. They have burned across all types of land tenure, including farm land, private land, urban tenure, state forest and crown land., David Bowman, the director of the Fire Centre at the University of Tasmania’s school of natural sciences, says the focus on national parks is misguided., “Why are people fixating on national parks when there are so many other landscapes that are bushland which are not national parks?” he says. “I think it’s distracting to be focused on one land tenure type. Broaden the conversation to bushland and then understand the operations to manage bushland are complicated. It’s not just about planned burning.”, Bowman says there is scope for discussion about how bushland is managed across different types of land tenure and has written that there may be a greater role for community groups., But he says there is also “a lot of misapprehension” about fuel management., “For example, fuel management can’t be applied to all vegetation types,” Bowman says. “There’s only certain types where it’s practically possible.”factcheck are national parks locked up and more vulnerable to bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-49": {"text": "\nThe week in wildlife – in pictures\n, The week in wildlife – in pictures, The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, including long-eared owls and an injured koala, \nEric Hilaire, \n\nFri 10 Jan 2020 09.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 10 Jan 2020 09.59 EST\n\n, Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA, Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Sergei Gapon/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Cailean Macleod/PA, Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images, Photograph: Grayden Fanning/Capt Dave’s Dolphin &amp; Whale Watching Safari/AP, Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Chamila Karunarathne/EPA, Photograph: Zsolt Czeglédi/EPA, Photograph: Chaideer Mahyuddin/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Hotli Simanjuntak/EPA, Photograph: Miguel Gutiérrez/EPA, Photograph: James Eaton/Birdtour Asia/Science, Photograph: West Sumatra BKSDA/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/Reutersthe week in wildlife in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-50": {"text": "\nGreta Thunberg tells world leaders to end fossil fuel ‘madness’\n, Failure to end investment ‘would be a betrayal against life itself’, say climate activists, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nFri 10 Jan 2020 08.03 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 10 Jan 2020 13.10 EST\n\n, Greta Thunberg and fellow youth climate campaigners are demanding that global leaders immediately end the “madness” of huge ongoing investments in fossil fuel exploration and enormous subsidies for coal, oil and gas use., The 21 young activists are also calling on the political and business leaders who will be attending the World Economic Forum in Davos to ensure investment funds dump their holdings in fossil fuel companies., “Anything less would be a betrayal against life itself,” said Thunberg and colleagues in an article in the Guardian. “Today’s business as usual is turning into a crime against humanity. We demand that you play your part in putting an end to this madness.”, The burning of fossil fuels is the biggest driver of the climate emergency. Scientists predict catastrophic impacts unless deep cuts in emissions are made rapidly, but global emissions are still rising., “Young people are being let down by older generations and those in power,” the climate strikers said. “To some it may seem like we are asking for a lot. But this is just the very minimum effort needed to start the rapid sustainable transition.”, Much of the world’s existing coal, oil and gas reserves must be kept in the ground to avoid the worst impacts of global heating. But investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction remains high., Since the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the world’s largest investment banks have provided more than $700bn (£535bn) to fossil fuel companies to develop new projects, with the total investment estimated to be trillions of dollars. Fossil fuel companies argue that their products will be used for many years to come and that they have a pivotal role in shifting the energy system to zero emissions. But their investments in green energy are tiny compared with those in fossil fuels., Subsidies for fossil fuels also remain high despite a G20 pledge in 2009 to eliminate them. The IMF estimates such subsidies run at $10m a minute, or $5.2tn a year. “The fact that ending investment and subsidies hasn’t been done already is, quite frankly, a disgrace,” said Thunberg and colleagues., Investors managing funds totalling $12tn have already divested from coal, oil and gas, but the climate activists demand that “all companies, banks, institutions and governments immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels”., Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said in December that the financial sector was not cutting investments in oil and gas companies rapidly enough and warned that assets in the sector could end up “worthless”. He said in October that companies and industries not moving towards zero-carbon emissions would be punished by investors and go bankrupt., “It ought to be in every company and stakeholder’s interest to make sure that the planet they live on will thrive,” said the climate strikers, who come from nations across the world, including the US, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India and Nigeria. “But history has not shown the corporate world’s willingness to hold themselves accountable. So it falls on us, the children, to do that.”, The agenda for the 50th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, which begins on 20 January in Switzerland, lists four “urgent and important” global issues. The first is “how to address the urgent climate and environmental challenges that are harming our ecology and economy”., The climate strikers said: “The world’s leaders should invest their money in existing sustainable technologies, research and in restoring nature.

Neil Hind, the Pinewoods Conservation Group (PCG) chair, said in the face of a climate emergency it was vital to preserve green spaces and mature trees, and not replace them with a factory producing bottled water., He said: “Harrogate Spring Water does a lot to share the name of Harrogate across the world, but is that benefit worth the loss of acres of woodland? We see no improvements or benefits that this planning application is going to give to the users of the Pinewoods.”, Dan McAndrew, a principal ecologist at Harrogate borough council, said no evidence had been provided to show how the extension could be achieved without biodiversity loss – therefore the application could not be supported from an ecological perspective., Harrogate Spring is Britain’s oldest bottled water and is ranked the country’s number one premium water brand. The family-owned company prides itself on its green credentials, and says its Harrogate facility is one of the most environmentally efficient facilities in the world., It received outline planning permission for the development in 2017, but has now submitted a revised application for a building 40% larger than originally put forward., McAndrew said this proposed increase made it much less likely sufficient environmental compensation could be achieved on site. The PCG are concerned that the revised application does not include details of the number of trees that will be planted to replace those lost., Harrogate Spring Water said updated ecological surveys would address these concerns in due course. Nicky Cain, brand manager for the company, acknowledged that it was “emotive land”. She said: “We want to retain as much as possible and make sure that it is still available for the public to use and enjoy.”, Cain said since naturally sourced water must be bottled at source, the company was limited in where it could expand in order to “remain competitive and grow the business”. She said some of the trees in the wood had failed to thrive, and that their plans would help improve accessibility to the site with new footpaths. Of the 1.86-hectare site, 0.8 hectares will be left as open space for public use, and will include paths, planting and sustainable drainage., Cain said the company had held public consultations throughout the process. She said: “We wanted to involve everybody, and try and reassure people that we would only do what’s in the town’s best interest. We have a requirement to grow in order to survive but at the same time, we don’t want to do that at the detriment of our environment and our community.”, The Pinewoods, including the Rotary Wood, was given asset of community value status in 2015, which gives it additional protection from development., Terry Knowles is a member of Harrogate Rotary club and was chair of the PCG when the Rotary Wood was originally planted. He said he was “pretty horrified” to see the company’s plans to increase the size of their extension., Knowles said: “There are a lot of wild orchids on the site, and since we’ve put all the trees in there’s a lot more wildlife there. So it’s not only the fact that trees are going to be knocked down, but the fact that wildlife has been sustained in the area.” He estimates that up to 1,500 trees are at risk., Harrogate borough council previously approved a plan to cut the district’s carbon dioxide emissions by 40% by 2020, and recent plans include tree planting for every child., Council leader Richard Cooper said last year: “I believe it is the most radical environmental manifesto put forward by a borough council ever and will place us at the forefront of the green movement in the public sector.”, A spokesman from Harrogate council, which owns the Rotary Wood site, said: “A revised application was submitted in December., “This amended application will now be considered through the normal planning process including consultation with statutory consultees and the public. It will then be presented before the planning committee at a date to be confirmed.”woodland at risk harrogate spring water expansion", "label": 0}, "train-52": {"text": "\nThe great dismantling of America's national parks is under way\n, In this waking nightmare, the Trump administration has filled the parks department with anti-public land sycophants, \nJonathan B Jarvis and \nDestry Jarvis, \n\nFri 10 Jan 2020 06.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 10 Jan 2020 17.26 EST\n\n, Sign up for updates on America’s public lands., Under this administration, nothing is sacred as we watch the nation’s crown jewels being recut for the rings of robber barons., For more than 100 years, professional management of our national parks has been respected under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Yes, they have different priorities, the Democrats often expanding the system and the Republicans historically focused on building facilities in the parks for expanding visitation. But the career public servants of the National Park Service (NPS), charged with stewarding America’s most important places, such as the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and the Statue of Liberty, were left to do their jobs., Even in the dark days of interior secretaries James Watt and Gail Norton, both former attorneys with the anti-environmental Mountain States Legal Foundation, the National Park Service (NPS) was generally left untouched, perhaps because they recognized that some institutions have too much public support or their mission too patriotic to be tossed under the proverbial bus., This time is different and we should know, as Jon, one of this story’s authors, worked for the last 10 interior secretaries as a career NPS manager, and ultimately led the agency under Barack Obama, and Destry, Jon’s brother and co-author, has worked with the past 12 NPS directors as a conservation advocate. The change began within 24 hours of the inauguration when Donald Trump complained that the NPS was reporting smaller crowds on the National Mall than Obama had drawn. Perhaps this is when the NPS wound up on the list of transgressors. Soon the interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, attempted to double the entrance fees, rescinded climate policies and moved seasoned senior national park superintendents around to force their retirements., After Zinke’s abrupt resignation, secretary David Bernhardt populated too much of the department’s political leadership with unconfirmed, anti-public land sycophants, and announced a reorganization to install his own lieutenants to oversee super regions, realigning NPS from seven regions to twelve in the name of greater efficiency., Next came the proclamation that career staff in Washington would be sent to the field to be closer to the people they serve, but in reality, to be out of the way and no longer an impediment to his agenda., Then came the decisions to leave the parks open to impacts during the unfortunate government shutdown, illegally misuse entrance fees, open park trails to e-bikes, suppress climate science, kill wolf pups and bear cubs in their dens to enhance “sport hunting”, privatize campgrounds, and issue muzzle memos to park managers. With a waiver of environmental laws, bulldozers are plowing ancient cacti in national parks along the southern border in order to build a wall. Senior career park managers are likely to be replaced with unqualified political hacks., These are not random actions. This is a systematic dismantling of a beloved institution, like pulling blocks from a Jenga tower, until it collapses. You ask, why on earth would someone want to do that to the popular National Park Service, the subject of one of Ken Burns’ acclaimed documentaries and often called “America’s best idea”?, Because if you want to drill, mine and exploit the public estate for the benefit of the industry, the last thing you want is a popular and respected agency’s voice raising alarms on behalf of conservation and historic preservation., Because if you want the public to ignore the science of climate change, the last thing you want are trusted park rangers speaking the truth to park visitors., Because if you want to get the federal government small enough (in the words of Grover Norquist) to “drown it in a bathtub”, the last thing you want is a government agency with high popular appeal that needs to grow rather than shrink., It is clear that this administration cannot be trusted with the keys to the vault of our most precious places that define us as a nation, such as Mount Rushmore or Yosemite national park., When this nightmare ends, and we begin to rebuild, we suggest it is time for Congress to consider making the National Park Service an independent institution, more akin to the Smithsonian, and no longer subject to the vicissitudes of a hostile political agenda in a Department of the Interior dominated by extractive industries and anti-public land crusaders., Brothers Jonathan and Destry Jarvis have spent a combined 87 years in the conservation of parks and public lands. Jonathan was the 18th director of the NPS and served in the agency for 40 years. Destry has spent 47 years as an advocate for national parks working for several non-governmental organizations and in the private sector., The opinions expressed here are those of the authors.

The vast ice desert of the Changthang plateau, situated between the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges, is the highest permanently inhabited plateau in the world and home to an extremely hardy and rare breed of goat: the Changra., The altitude, freezing temperatures and harsh bitter winds in this unforgiving mountainous region stimulate the growth of the goats’ supersoft undercoat. The fibres measure a mere 8-10 microns in width, making it about 10 times finer than human hair and eight times warmer than sheep wool. This luxurious fibre is known the world over as pashmina, the softest and most expensive type of cashmere wool in the world., A yak caravan winds its way up and down the steep valleys. Nowadays, vehicles are used to transport the heavy and bulky items, but with freezing oil and no four-wheel drive, they are no match for a yak., Rearing these valuable animals in such inhospitable conditions are the Changpa nomads. For centuries these nomadic shepherds, who are as hardy as their animals, have roamed “the roof of the world”, moving their herds of yak, sheep and goats along traditional migratory routes in this high altitude desert every few months in search of fresh grazing pastures., Changra goats are perfectly at home in the high mountains but when heavy snow falls and freezes hard, their food becomes difficult to reach. To prevent this, they are given food supplements., Cashmere is expensive and rightly so. The Changpa carefully comb the goats’ hair during the spring moulting season to harvest the downy undercoat and then the good fibre is laboriously separated from the bad by hand. Once cleaned and processed, the wool from a single cashmere goat only amounts to a mere four ounces. After the fibres are manually sorted, cleaned and hand-spun, the weaving process can begin, which is equally demanding and painstaking., It takes several months to a year for highly skilled artisans to work their magic on wooden looms and weave a masterpiece, which will be exported around the world and sold for up to $2,000 (£1,500) by luxury retailers., A herder undertakes the time-consuming job of separating the corse outer hair from the finer, softer undercoat. Changpa women, who have given up the nomadic herding life, spend much of their time weaving., This ancient way of life is now very much under threat. Nomads and scientists alike believe climate change is the biggest threat to pashmina production in the region. The Changthang plateau does not usually get much snowfall, and if it does, it begins in January or February., However, for the past few years it has been increasingly heavy, starting as early as December or even November. Food supplements have to be brought in to prevent the animals dying from starvation. Winters have also been getting warmer, which has reduced the quality and quantity of the valuable pashmina wool., Many of the elders still wear their traditional dress, which is considerably warmer that modern clothes. The Changpa do not actually wear cashmere, simply because it is too valuable., Over a relatively short period of time, dozens of nomad families from the village of Kharnak in the Changthang plateau have migrated away to set up their own neighbourhood called Kharnak Ling on the outskirts of Leh city, 180km away., “These are worrying times we are experiencing,” says the Kharnak village chief. “If weather patterns continue like they are then it could have an irreversible impact on pashmina goat-rearing on the Changthang., “There were once more than 90 families in Kharnak and now there are only 16,” he adds. “If the number of Changpa families in Kharnak falls below 10 then life will become too tough for us to continue this life. The younger generation would rather work in the city and cannot be persuaded to continue this physically, mentally and emotionally demanding existence.”, India’s Textile Ministry is now trying to help reverse the trend before it is too late. It is providing $1.2m for winter fodder and 50 animals to each herder as a way of encouraging the Changpa to return to rearing goats on the plateau., In recent years, due to a lack of cashmere wool from Ladakhi herders, weavers in Kashmir have begun importing raw Pashmina from China and Mongolia to meet ever-increasing demand. Much of this pashmina is not what it is claimed to be; the goats at not reared in the extreme conditions required to stimulate the growth of the supersoft undercoat to be officially classified as 100% pure pashmina. Ladakh produces less than 1% of the world’s total raw cashmere, but it is renowned for being the finest in the world., Due to the decreasing numbers of this rare Himalayan goat and increasing demand for genuine cashmere from the Ladakh region of Kashmir, scientists at the University of Kashmir decided to create the world’s first cloned pashmina goat. The project, partly funded by the World Bank but mostly by the Indian government, was successful, and on 9 March 2012 the female kid Noori was born., The scientists had planned to share their goat-cloning knowledge across the Himalayas to help others grow their own goats. However, this has not gone down well with the Changpa herders in the region, primarily because of their Buddhist beliefs., Each family has several hundred goats, all of which need to be moved separately so that they don’t get mixed up., The threat to pashmina goat-rearing would not only mean the end of the livelihoods of about 300,000 people in the Jammu and Kashmir state who, directly or indirectly, depend on pashmina, but would also mean an end to the unique culture of the Changpa; most of them are followers of Tibetan Buddhism and have an elaborate set of customs centred around their livestock.cashmere country the perils of making the worlds finest fabric", "label": 0}, "train-55": {"text": "\nCountry diary: the dipper's sweet singing lifts the winter gloom\n, Allendale, Northumberland: The song’s fluidity mimics the movement of the river where it lives and is especially cheering on a cold morning, \nSusie White, \n\nFri 10 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, There’s very little birdsong in this valley right now. Just thin wisps of notes from the robin, the see-sawing sounds of great tits on warm days or wild bursts from mistle thrushes that, in some years, I’ve recorded in my diary around Christmas time., There’s one bird, though, that sings throughout the year and that is the dipper. I listen for it when I step outside the back door. This song has a fluidity that seems all about the movement of the river where it lives, a stream of calmer moments followed by flurries of repeated notes. It has some of the sweetness of the skylark mixed with the variety of the thrush. In summer, I straighten from working the veg garden to take notice. In winter, when even the sheep are silent, it’s especially uplifting., On this cold January morning I go out into the glinting world of the frosted field. There’s ice on the pussy willows, ice on tufts of caught wool, ice turning barbed wire into tinsel. Where the river bends, a dipper sings from a boulder in the fast-flowing mid-current; favourite perching rocks are streaked in white droppings at intervals down the stream. They have a strong attachment to territory, with nest sites being traditional, and pairs are monogamous, sometimes for years., As a child, I first saw a dipper walking underwater below Jedburgh Abbey. Through the clarity of the Jed, I marvelled as it picked food from the gravel bed; mayfly nymphs, caddisfly larvae and tiny fish such as minnows are in its diet., Dippers have dense feathers, preened with oil to waterproof them, and they manoeuvre through the water using their wings. They are unfazed by cold. In the winter of 2010, when the East Allen had all but frozen over, water gurgling beneath a solid five inches as if in a cavern, I watched a dipper feeding. A dark blur, it moved resolutely this way and that, popping up occasionally, flicking its nictitating membranes over its eyes., Mating early in the season and being equipped for tough weather, the dippers of the East Allen may have their first clutch within only seven or eight weeks.country diary the dippers sweet singing lifts the winter gloom", "label": 0}, "train-56": {"text": "\nBlair attacks nuclear power privatisation - archive, 1989\n, 10 January 1989: As well as cost, Labour’s energy spokesman warns about the risk of nuclear accidents, Patrick Donovan, industrial correspondent, \n\nFri 10 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 26 Mar 2020 10.19 EDT\n\n, Tony Blair, Labour’s energy spokesman, yesterday launched a new assault against the flotation of the electricity industry by declaring that the sale of nuclear power will be “the most expensive mistake in the history of privatisation”., Speaking on the eve of the Electricity Bill starting its committee stage in parliament and today’s long awaited Department of Energy publication of the ‘licences’, Mr Blair added that the Government faces “a potential bill running into billions of pounds”., Mr Blair claimed that the public will have to meet the cost of decommissioning nuclear power stations but will lose the profit from the industry. Huge undervaluation of the industry’s overall assets will be needed “to compensate City investors for buying nuclear capacity”, he said., Question marks also remain over the size of insurance against nuclear accidents, once the industry has been floated off. Mr Blair added: “The Government is now firmly astride the horns of its nuclear dilemma; its obsession with privatisation demands that the industry be privatised but the reality is that the private sector has no intention of buying the industry unless the risks are removed. So we are being forced into the uniquely absurd situation where the public will actually pay to have an industry privatised and yet still retain after privatisation all the key elements of risk”, he said.blair attacks nuclear power privatisation archive 1989", "label": 0}, "train-57": {"text": "\nGrass growing around Mount Everest as global heating intensifies\n, Impact of increase in shrubs and grasses not yet known but scientists say it could increase flooding in the region, \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nThu 9 Jan 2020 19.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 10 Jan 2020 10.00 EST\n\n, Shrubs and grasses are springing up around Mount Everest and across the Himalayas, one of the most rapidly heating regions of the planet., The impact on water supplies of the small but significant increase in vegetation between the treeline and snowline is not yet known but could increase flooding in the vast Hindu Kush Himalayan region, which covers 4.2msq km(1.6m sq miles), feeds Asia’s 10 largest river systems and supplies 1.4 billion people with water., Scientists used satellite data to identify increases in vegetation in the inaccessible subnival (the highest zone allowing plant growth) ecosystem, made up of grasses and dwarf shrubs with seasonal snow. This ecosystem is known but could play a crucial role in the region’s hydrology, covering between five and 15 times the area of permanent glaciers and snow in the region., Studying images from 1993 to 2018 provided by Nasa’s Landsat satellites, researchers from Exeter University measured the spread of vegetation cover across four height brackets from 4,150 to 6,000 metres above sea level., The melting of Himalayan glaciers has doubled since the turn of the century, with more than a quarter of all ice lost over the last four decades. Research has suggested that its ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate-induced shifts in vegetation., “A lot of research has been done on ice melting in the Himalayan region, including a study that showed how the rate of ice loss doubled between 2000 and 2016,” said Dr Karen Anderson, of the Environment and Sustainability Institute on Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall., “It’s important to monitor and understand ice loss in major mountain systems, but subnival ecosystems cover a much larger area than permanent snow and ice, and we know very little about them and how they moderate water supply.”, It is not yet known how more vegetation might affect water supplies but studies of increased vegetation in the Arctic found that they delivered a warming effect in the surrounding landscape, with the plants absorbing more light and warming the soil., “That would be bad news for the Himalayas,” said Anderson. “The subnival zone is where seasonal snow is held and if it is warmer you will get flashy hydrology – quicker melt rates and an increased risk of flooding.”, But Anderson said that more vegetation may not actually increase warming and flood risks in the Himalayas, with the only study in the region, in Tibet, finding that the water in the plants that is evaporated through their leaf surface actually exerted a cooling influence., “We really don’t know much about this area and we need to direct research attention towards it because it’s a major part of the water supply story in the Himalayas,” she added., The study, published in Global Change Biology, was made possible by Google’s new Earth Engine, which provides researchers with a freely accessible collection of government agency satellite data in the cloud. Previously, researchers would have had to build a super-computer to sift through the enormous quantities of satellite data., “It has really revolutionised this kind of work and enables large-scale, long time-series investigations like this to happen,” said Anderson.grass growing around mount everest as global heating intensifies", "label": 0}, "train-58": {"text": "\nSee a show and help save the planet as the West End turns green\n, \nSee a show and help save the planet as the West End turns green\n, \nVanessa Thorpe, \n\nSat 11 Jan 2020 11.09 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Sat 11 Jan 2020 09.05 EST\n\n, After Extinction Rebellion’s call for urgent action on the streets of London last year, the issue of climate change is to stage another major London takeover. From 23 March, the wider environmental debate will dominate proceedings inside a West End theatre for eight weeks., Performers including Alistair McGowan, Rob Brydon, Gaby Roslin and Jason Manford are to join experts in the field at the Charing Cross theatre, alongside the double Olivier award-winner and West End leading lady, Janie Dee, for the inaugural London Climate Change festival., Dee, the force behind the festival, is soon to star on stage in the hit American comedy Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike, which has its London premiere at the Charing Cross theatre on 21 March. The play won a succession of top awards during its run in New York, where it starred Sigourney Weaver. The London Climate Change festival, formally unveiled on Monday, will run from March to May and will feature standup, dance, music and cabaret, in addition to talks from a changing line-up of visiting speakers, including the popular environmentalist and author Natalie Fee.

Police now say that was an error., Amnesty International condemned the decision on Saturday as criticism grew and questions remained about how Extinction Rebellion (XR) came to be included in the guide alongside neo-Nazi and terrorist groups., The climate emergency campaign group was included in a 12-page document produced by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) titled “Safeguarding young people and adults from ideological extremism”., XR has instructed lawyers., Jules Carey, who acted for XR when it successfully struck down police protest bans in the courts last year, told the Guardian that the latest guidance was unlawful. “It is extraordinary that Counter Terrorism Policing South East have added Extinction Rebellion to the list of terrorist groups and extremist organisations that the Prevent strategy was set up to deal with., “The guidance issued by the CTPSE is clearly unlawful. It constitutes an unlawful interference with human rights including free speech, right to assemble and enjoyment of a private life., “The guidance is clearly designed to harm Extinction Rebellion and cast those who support the movement as domestic extremists. It is a glaring example of the sort of overzealous policing we have come to expect around protests. Being referred to Prevent could have long-lasting and life-changing consequences for a young school activist.”, After inquiries by the Guardian police said they were recalling the guidance and that XR had been included in error in the guide, which was distributed to police, government and teachers in November 2019., Carey, of Bindmans solicitors, said: “It is not sufficient that CTPSE have sought to recall the guide from those that they shared it with. The advice in the guide … itself needs to be formally withdrawn and any decision taken to refer an activist of XR to Prevent needs to be urgently reversed.” , Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s campaigns director, said the police guidance added to longstanding concerns about Prevent. “It’s deeply shocking that the police ever seriously considered classifying peaceful climate crisis protesters as extremists. To see that schoolchildren were effectively going to be profiled under these proposed measures, just deepens our shock., “Given that children are potentially those who will be most affected by the climate emergency, it’s vital that they are able to speak out on these issues without this heavy-handed and entirely disproportionate police attention. This episode only adds to our existing concerns about Prevent, which is a highly dubious scheme sorely in need of a proper, independent and impartial review.”, Prevent is the the government’s anti-radicalisation programme. It is intended to spot people at risk of becoming involved in terrorism and divert them away from extremism., Concerns have been raised that it impinges on freedom of thought and speech. Its supporters, which include the government and the police, say it is vital to stop the flow of recruits to Islamist and extreme rightwing violence, but it has been accepted that changes may be needed., A review of Prevent that is due to report later this year is expected to be delayed after its original chair stepped down following criticism and a legal challenge., The police document revealed by the Guardian said that issues to look out for included people who speak in “strong or emotive terms about environmental issues like climate change, ecology, species extinction, fracking, airport expansion or pollution”., The guide advises readers to listen and look out for young people who “neglect to attend school” or “participate in planned school walkouts” – an allusion to the school strikes for the climate, a global movement of which the activist Greta Thunberg is a lead proponent. Thousands of UK pupils and millions worldwide walked out of school last year in protest at government inaction on the climate crisis., The document also flags young people taking part in non-violent direct action, such as sit-down protests, banner drops or “writing environmentally themed graffiti”., The disclosure that XR has been listed alongside proscribed groups such as National Action and al-Muhajiroun is being blamed on police in the south-east of England rather than a decision at the national level., Clare Collier of the civil rights group Liberty said: “This is a startling example of how Prevent stifles free speech, labels dissent as dangerous and gives the police sweeping powers to monitor non-violent, non-criminal behaviour. The definition of extremism under Prevent is fundamentally flawed and so wide that thousands – including children – are swept up by it., “Protest is fundamental to democracy and our ability to stand up to power. This year alone Extinction Rebellion, the school strikes and other protests have shown how valuable protest is for bringing about change. We corrode the right to protest at our peril.”, A spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain, which has long criticised how Prevent operates, said: “This case illustrates the serious flaws in the Prevent programme and a kneejerk reaction to create a list of undesirables, drawn up by divisive ideologues. The sooner a replacement independent reviewer can be found, the better.”, CTPSE would not answer questions about how XR came to be included., On Friday DCS Kath Barnes, the head of CTPSE, said: “I would like to make it quite clear that we do not classify Extinction Rebellion as an extremist organisation. The inclusion of Extinction Rebellion in this document was an error of judgment and we will now be reviewing all of the contents as a result., “It was produced by CTPSE to assist our statutory partners – including police forces and government organisations – in identifying people who may be vulnerable as a result of their links to some organisations., “The document was designed for a very specific audience who understand the complexities of the safeguarding environment we work within and who have statutory duties under Prevent. We are in the process of confirming who it has been shared with and recalling it., “We as counter-terrorism policing, along with our partners, have a responsibility to protect vulnerable people.

Not only are they biodegradable – some also absorb toxins, \nNell Card, \n\nSat 11 Jan 2020 07.00 EST\n\n, Cocoa husks, dried orange peel, ground blue pea flowers: the ingredients read like a tasting menu. They are, in fact, waste products that are used to make Orb – a sustainable building material that is carbon neutral. It’s versatile enough to be used for furniture or as a substitute for a wood-based sheet material, Orb is produced by Biohm, a startup founded in 2016 by Ehab Sayed. Sayed grew up in Doha, Qatar, and says his home town is one of the “biggest motivators” for him to inspire change. “Although it is the richest country in the world, it is likely one of the least sustainable and a contributor to the climate crisis,” he says. “Growing up in this environment resulted in a resentment towards the impact we are having on our planet.”, Sayed studied design engineering and graduated from Brunel University with an MSc in integrated product design. “I have always been shocked at how manufacturers and material developers don’t extend their responsibility to their product’s end of life and how inefficient our waste management processes are. The concept of waste has never made sense to me,” he says. “It is a human construct that has resulted in major problem.”, During his studies, he conducted two research projects. The first explored which industries caused hazardous levels of waste in the UK. “Everything pointed towards construction,” he says. The second looked at the environmental impact of those waste materials. “That was even more shocking,” he says. Sayed decided that the way to tackle this is to create buildings from natural materials. “I started exploring what could be used, knowing that I absolutely had to find a solution for structural materials, insulation and sheet materials.”, Sayed’s “material development journey” led him to Open Cell, a community of biotech startups based in shipping containers behind Shepherd’s Bush market in west London. With a small team of designers, engineers and scientists, he has developed two materials: Orb, made out of food or agricultural waste, and mycelium insulation, made by feeding waste to the root system of mushrooms., “The aim is to replace every harmful construction material with something sustainable and higher performing,” Sayed explains. Sheet material and insulation are just two of the products being manufactured: plant-based concrete is in development. So far, mycelium insulation outperforms almost everything on the market. According to Sayed: “The only thing it doesn’t outperform is polystyrene, which is flammable and there are specks of it all over the place.”, The waste used by Biohm comes straight from industry, rather than via a waste management company. Orange peels collected from the staff canteen of a tech giant (a staggering three tonnes of which are produced each week) and the grass cuttings collected from a London airport (up to 47 tonnes per week) are just two of the localised waste streams that go into producing Orb. The orange peel board – which is cork-like in texture and varies in tone from warm honey to rich brown, depending on how long the peel has dried for – is then sold to the company in the form of panels, tiles and risers. , Mycelium insulation can be grown from more toxic byproducts because it can break down petrochemicals and other substances into harmless hydrocarbons, which are then absorbed into the material. Biohm’s researchers discovered this by accident at the beginning of last year when they were developing a strain of mycelium in the lab that slowly grew out of its jar and consumed a nearby plastic sponge. “When we cut the mycelium open, there were absolutely no remnants of the sponge at all,” Sayed explains, “just a small square where it had been.”, Biohm has two labs at Open Cell: one dirty and one clean. “Because we’re working with natural living organisms that do most of the work, there is very little machinery involved,” Sayed says. The equipment set up in the “dirty” lab has been adapted from the food and agriculture industry. There is what looks like a huge bread mixer and a standing press for moulding the boards. There is a sample of Orb: a deep brown square of textured material, that has been dyed with discarding cocoa husks. “It smells like a cereal bar, right?” says Sayed. “It is completely edible: that’s how natural it is.”, In the “clean” lab, things look a little less familiar. There is a particularly sensitive piece of mycelium growing – a lumpen, organic shape slowly expanding into one corner of the shipping container. Along one wall are jars of mycelium covered in foil lids. Sayed explains that there are up to 5m species of mycelium in the world. Biohm is developing around 300 strains that have been gathered by hand from forests and gardens. They begin the growing process by feeding the mycelium with a nutrient-rich food source, such as grain. This is then mixed with a substrate (the waste product), to see how well it grows. Those that perform well are cloned and developed further by Biohm’s biotechnology engineer., Because it involves so little machinery, products have high profit margins and a double revenue stream: Biohm is paid to collect waste and can sell on the material created from it. As a result, Sayed claims its products can compete with everything in the market. Customers are contractually bound to return any materials to Biohm at end of life – they are collected free of charge (the cost of this is built in). “This is how far the manufacturer’s responsibility should extend,” insists Sayed. The aim is to challenge the stigma around sustainable materials, making them the affordable norm, as opposed to a rarefied, premium product. , This month, Biohm will open its first mycelium production facility outside London, in a disused paper mill. “We’ve always wanted to have social impact embedded in our business model – we just didn’t know exactly how we were going to do that,” says Sayed. In its second year, Biohm was contacted by the Onion Collective. Based in Watchet, West Somerset. The all-female community business was looking for a pioneering biotech company with global ambitions to replace the 175 jobs that were lost when the town’s paper mill closed in 2015., “Context is everything,” explains Sally Lowndes, director of the Onion Collective. “When the mill closed, it was completely devastating. It had been operating for 250 years. It was the beating heart of our economy here in Watchet, providing both jobs and our sense of identity.” After the closure of the mill, 20% of the working population lost their jobs. “Watchet is a beautiful place to live, with a strong sense of community, but we have the lowest social mobility in the entire country. We also have one of the oldest populations in the country and the lowest income. We’re a coastal community, one and a half hours from the nearest city. The current economic system doesn’t work for places like ours.” The Onion Collective works to create a new model of local economics and Biohm is at the centre of that plan., At the old paper mill, 3,000 sq m of mycelium insulation will be produced per month – enough to sequester 16 tonnes of carbon. (“Just by creating the material, we’re having a positive impact,” says Sayed.) The facility will employ 14 local people in the first year, with the aim of rising to 200 over five years. The revenue generated by the facility – estimated at £3m-5m per annum in three years’ time – will provide a profit share that will be retained locally. “This will be a community industry and a beautiful continuation of what was on this site before,” says Lowndes. “We’re thinking deeply about how to counter gentrification and the ways we can bring the whole community along for the ride.”, By partnering with social enterprises, Biohm is able to raise grants to pay for setup costs, employ a local workforce and use local waste streams. A similar project is planned with the YMCA in Newcastle this summer, in which Biohm will provide six-month employment schemes for disadvantaged young people. Governments in Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands have approached Biohm to set up facilities in towns in need of regeneration and there is talk of a facility in Mumbai. “We are both trying to change the world, really,” says Lowndes in summation. Together, they appear to have all the right ingredients.could mushrooms and orange peel detoxify the building industry", "label": 0}, "train-61": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a Welsh well of wisdom\n, Migneint, Snowdonia: After crossing the Afon Conwy watershed you come across a sturdy structure whose name and function remains a mystery, \nJim Perrin, \n\nSat 11 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, The lane that climbs steeply through conifers from Cwm Penmachno relaxes finally on reaching the moor above, and dawdles for a narrow mile through peat hags to arrive at a road junction in the lonely heart of Migneint (“place of quagmires”). Eastwards, the B4407 broaches the moor to descend alongside an infant Afon Conwy. The experimental novelist BS Johnson (1933-73) wrote a remarkable “phantom hitchhiker” story about encountering a sheela-na-gig while driving across here on his way from Kilpeck in Herefordshire to the Llyn Peninsula one wild evening. Whenever I visit the remote abandoned tyddyn – now a bothy – of Cefn Garw, two miles across the moor by the Afon Serw, it returns to haunt me, as though Johnson’s story had invoked the tutelary spirit of this wild and watery place, more suited to soaring buzzards, scudding merlins and quartering kites than to human habitation., West and south, the B4407 passes the fine little rock outcrop of Carreg y Foel Gron above Llyn Du Bach before coming to Pont yr Afon Gam, where the road from Bala heads down to Llan Ffestiniog. This is bracing country., At that first lane junction after crossing the Afon Conwy watershed there is a mystery. It’s a well, sturdily reconstructed in 1846, bearing the carved exhortation “Yf a bydd ddiolchgar” (Drink and be thankful). It’s alongside one of the old drove routes from Wales to the English smithfields. But this well was not for cattle, or for pigs, though traces of a retaining compound for swine still abut the structure. The access to its stone basin is staggered, leading through interlocking baffles that fattened animals could not have negotiated., Ffynnon Eidda (Eidda’s well) is its name, and that’s a further mystery. Eidda may be related to local names for understated features on these moors. In summer, children from Llan pedal noisily up here to roll up their sleeves and retrieve coins flung by passing motorists into its chill, clear water.

It plans to use all profits to reinvest in maintaining the community projects and building new ones., Phil Ponsonby, the chief executive of Midcounties Co-operative, said the tariff is the UK’s only one to be powered by 100% community-generated electricity and would ensure a fair price is paid to community generators too., Customers on the Community Power tariff will be able to “see exactly where it is being generated at small scale sites across the UK, and they know it is benefiting local communities”, he said., Co-op, which has about 300,000 customers, has set itself apart from a rising number of energy supply deals which are marked as 100% renewable, but are not as green as they seem., Consumer group Which? has found that many suppliers offer renewable energy tariffs but do not generate renewable electricity themselves or have contracts to buy any renewable electricity directly from generators., Instead, the “pale green” suppliers exploit a loophole in the energy market by snapping up cheap renewable energy certificates, without necessarily buying energy from renewables projects. , The certificates are issued by the regulator to renewable energy developers for each megawatt generated, but these can be sold separately from the electricity for a fraction of the price., Which? warned that these suppliers appear to be greenwashing their energy tariffs, which could risk misleading customers. A survey conducted last year found that one in 10 people believe that a renewables tariff means that the supplier generates at least some of its electricity from its own renewable energy projects., Ponsonby said the wind and solar schemes that generate electricity for the Community Power tariff “plough the profits they make back into their neighbourhoods or into helping other similar projects get off the ground”., Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said being able to buy locally-sourced clean, green energy is “a massive jump in the right direction” which will help grow the UK’s green electricity capacity., “Investing in more local energy infrastructure and getting Britain’s homes run by the sun when it’s shining and the wind when it’s blowing can end our reliance on dirty fossil fuels sooner than we hoped,” he said., “Local people investing in local people means that we can all muck in and put the work in to decarbonise where governments and large companies are slow to.”community generated green electricity to be offered to all in uk", "label": 0}, "train-63": {"text": "\nThere’s no extremism in Extinction Rebellion\n, Letters, \n\nSun 12 Jan 2020 12.54 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 12 Jan 2020 12.57 EST\n\n, The Guardian’s recent revelation that Extinction Rebellion (XR) had been classed as an extremist ideology in now hastily withdrawn advice issued by counter-terrorism police (Anti-terror police target school climate strikes, 11 January) is the latest example of a wider campaign seeking to undermine public support for our non-violent movement. In July, we saw the release of a report on XR by the former head of the Met’s counter-terrorism command, Richard Walton, done for the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange. His report makes a series of overinflated and discredited claims about XR, and it was subsequently revealed that Policy Exchange itself has taken funding from big energy companies., Walton’s report came out in the context of a persistent media campaign that sought to paint XR in the worst possible light, and it appears to have been the basis of the foolish action by counter-terrorism police. Yet despite all this, XR is as strong as ever. Our group remains resolutely committed to non-violence in our use of direct action, and 2020 promises an escalation in our campaign for action on the ecological and climate and emergencies., There is nothing “extreme” about this approach to a collapsing ecology. Those who seek to paint the common sense of defending our planetary home from its becoming an inferno as extreme are heavily invested in maintaining a crumbling status quo. There is a profound irony to this of, course, as climate collapse is the biggest possible threat to anything like the status quo that can be imagined.Prof Rupert ReadSpokesperson, Extinction Rebellion, • As a member of XR and having been arrested under section 14 of the Public Order Act, I went to trial last week at City of London magistrates court with the intention of testing the defence of “necessity”. My judge said I had made a “compelling case” and I received a conditional discharge. However, in the light of the recent guidance by counter-terrorism police, should I now report him to Prevent for expressing his sympathy for, and understanding of, XR’s cause?Tom HardyLondon, • Having resolved this year to look for the good news as an antidote to the gloom and doom we are drip-fed daily, I was thankful to Gaby Hinsliff for drawing my attention to the attempts being made to encourage people to talk to each other (We’ve built a world that feels cold. Yet we still want to connect, Journal, 4 January)., Her analysis of how the UK’s social capital was increasing was very uplifting in these dark January days, but there was one serious omission: Extinction Rebellion. I joined XR last October and soon found out that it is about a lot more than climate change. In these days when the world is increasingly looking as if it is going mad, taking part in XR has exposed me to a bubble of sanity: strangers talk to each other, care for each other and even share food. Cooperation is the order of the day, people are treated as equals and we all share a determination to work together to achieve our aims.Eileen PeckBenfleet, Essex, • Greta Thunberg (A message to Davos leaders: end the fossil fuel economy, Journal, 11 January) rightly calls for an immediate end to investments in fossil fuels. The key businesses to target are the world’s top banks, which invested $1.9tn in 2016-18, with the amount rising each year. Bill McKibben of 350.org recently pointed out that banks could be pushed to improve their performance on climate much more quickly than governments. Unlike most other businesses, banks can readily switch their investments in pursuit of a more reliable profit and to protect their brand., Climate campaigns need to target a few of the most susceptible and guilty banks. Campaigns can inspire citizens to pressure these banks to clean up their act, to avoid reputational damage and major loss of customers.Tim RootCoordinator, Muswell Hill &amp; Hornsey Friends of the Earth, • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com, • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters, • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Our second hottest year was 2013, followed by 2005, 2018 and 2017., New South Wales – one state hard hit by the bushfires – broke its record by a greater margin, with temperatures 1.95C above average, beating the previous record year, 2018, by 0.27C., At a very basic level, rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere change the Earth’s radiation balance, allowing less heat to escape., Australia also had its driest ever year in 2019, with rainfall 40% lower than average, based on records going back to 1900. NSW also had its driest year., A visualisation from Prof Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University, examines hot and dry years in Australia since 1910 and how they correlate with major bushfires., Fire authorities and the Bureau of Meteorology look at the risk of bushfires using the forest fire danger index, a combined measure of temperature, humidity, wind speed and the dryness, but not the amount, of fuel on the ground., Australia’s 2019 spring months of September, October and November were the worst  on a record going back to 1950 for bushfire risk., There have been two other meteorological patterns that helped generate the extreme conditions Australia has been experiencing, and both these “modes of variability” were in “phases” that made conditions worse., The Indian Ocean dipole was in a “positive phase”, meaning the Indian Ocean off Australia’s north-west was cooler than normal and the west of the ocean was warmer., Positive dipole events draw moisture away from Australia and tend to deliver less rainfall., But there is evidence that the extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are also impacting the dipole and another phenomenon, known as the southern annular mode (SAM)., A 2009 study found that positive dipole events “precondition” the south of the country for dangerous bushfire seasons and that these events were becoming more common., A 2018 study in the journal Nature Communications found the number of extreme positive dipole events goes up as climate heating continues., At 1.5C of global warming, the frequency of extreme positive dipole events doubles compared with the pre-industrial period., The southern annular mode was in a “negative phase” as the bushfires took hold in November and December. This phase was generated by a sudden warming event in the stratosphere above Antarctica., This caused westerly winds to track further north, blowing hot air across the continent into fire-prone areas, further fanning flames., Abram’s own research has found that the SAM is being pushed towards more positive phases which, when they occur in Australia’s winter, tend to dry the continent., Prof Matt England, of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, said: “These modes of variability are not changing in a way that’s good for south-east Australia., “We know with certainty that we are stacking the dice for the chances of these extreme drought years because of the changes in the modes.”, Scientists have already detected a trend towards more dangerous fire weather in Australia., A 2017 study of 67 years of FFDI data found a “clear trend toward more dangerous conditions during spring and summer in southern Australia, including increased frequency and magnitude of extremes, as well as indicating an earlier start to the fire season”., That trend continued in 2019, which was the riskiest year for bushfires on a record going back to 1950., A study of Queensland’s historic 2018 bushfire season found the extreme temperatures that coincided with the fires were four times more likely because of human-caused climate change., In advice issued in November 2019, Australia’s National Environmental Science Program was unambiguous., “Human-caused climate change has resulted in more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in recent decades for many regions of Australia., “Observations show a trend towards more dangerous conditions during summer and an earlier start to the fire season, particularly in parts of southern and eastern Australia., “These trends are very likely to increase into the future, with climate models showing more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires throughout Australia due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.”, Despite such unequivocal statements, Scott Morrison has been irritated that interviewers have asked about his government’s record on climate change, saying it was “just ridiculous” to link “any one emissions reduction policy to any of these fires”., Morrison’s argument that no emissions reduction policy can be tied to individual events is spurious, as the same argument could be put for any and all efforts to reduce emissions anywhere in the world, at any time., Scientists also believe that 2019 was a “standout” year in Australia for the formation of extreme bushfires that became “coupled” with the atmosphere, generating their own lightning and gusty, violent and unpredictable winds. Rainfall is replaced with blackened hail and embers that can be shot out over distances of 30km., Another study has found that global heating will create more favourable conditions for these “pyroCB” storms to form in Australia., Climate studies show that conditions in Australia for extreme bushfires will only get worse as more greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere., On Friday afternoon the president of the Australian Academy of Science, Prof John Shine, said Australia would need to further improve its climate modelling ability and understanding of fire behaviour to mitigate against the extreme events that would become more frequent and intense because of climate change., “Australia must take stronger action as part of the worldwide commitment to limit global warming to 1.5° C above the long-term average to reduce the worst impacts of climate change,” he said., England said: “We are loading the dice for more and more of these summers. But we have had knowledge of this for some time., “What we have seen in Australia this year will just be a normal summer if we warmed the planet by 3C. And an extreme summer would be even worse than we’ve seen now.”, Abram said: “Even from my perspective, I am surprised by just how bad 1C of warming is looking., “It’s worrying that we are talking about this as a new normal, because we are actually on an upward trajectory. Currently the pledges in the Paris agreement are not enough to limit us to 1.5C – we are looking more like 3C.”explainer what are the underlying causes of australias shocking bushfire season", "label": 0}, "train-65": {"text": "\nHow bad can the climate crisis get if Trump wins again?\n, US greenhouse gas emissions are up since 2017 and Trump’s administration has ripped up curbs on climate polluters, \nEmily Holden in Washington, \n\nSun 12 Jan 2020 04.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 21 Apr 2020 05.49 EDT\n\n, Climate pollution in the US is up under Donald Trump and threatens to undermine international efforts to stall the crisis, especially if he wins re-election this year and secures a second term in the White House., While US climate emissions fell 2.1% in 2019, they rose significantly in 2018, according to estimates from the economic analysis firm Rhodium Group. On net, emissions are slightly higher than in the beginning of 2017, when Trump’s administration began enacting dozens of environment rollbacks aimed at helping the oil and gas industry., Trump is still working to further weaken bedrock standards. This week he proposed to allow major projects like pipelines and highways to bypass reviews of how they will contribute to global warming. The draft rule is unlikely to become final before the November election, but it is yet another reason industries weighing climate choices might delay significant action., “What they have done is created confusion within the business community and the environmental world as to what are going to be the standards,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who led the Environmental Protection Agency under the Republican president George W Bush. “Essentially every regulation the agency promulgates gets a lawsuit that goes with it, almost inevitably … that’s the only good thing you can say about it.”, Whitman called the approach “mindless” and said “whoever is a bigger donor gets to tell them what the environmental policy should be, it seems”., In the absence of any federal climate action, states, cities and businesses have pledged their own efforts, seeking to encourage other big emitters like China and India to continue to slow their growing climate pollution., Andrew Light, a climate negotiator for President Barack Obama’s state department, said the world is taking note of those efforts, but if Trump is re-elected “you are going to see a lot of people who are worried anew about what the US can do”., Americans choosing Trump would send the signal that they don’t care about the climate, Light said., America’s Pledge, a project to quantify ongoing US emissions reductions, estimates that non-federal actors – like states and cities – could cut climate pollution 37% below 2005 levels by 2030. A Democrat in the White House could increase that to 49% with what Light described as modest, politically achievable policy changes. Experts are increasingly calling for the US to halve its emissions by 2030 and neutralize them by 2050., “In the case of a second Trump term, we’ve got to totally double down on the efforts to communicate how serious the non-federal actors are in the United States,” Light said. “And what you really want to try to make sure is that those people in other countries who are not in favor of strengthening their countries’ own climate target are not able to point to the United States and say nothing’s going on there.”, The Trump administration has initiated essentially all of its planned climate rollbacks – from weakening standards for cars to go farther on less gasoline to erasing rules for power companies to shift away from coal. It would be able to defend those changes in court against environment advocates and Democratic states if the president wins election., “The biggest impact of a second term of a Trump administration would just be more lost time,” said Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium Group. “It would be more time in which emissions weren’t really declining when they really needed to be.”, The concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases is at a record high, according to a report from the UN’s World Meteorological Organization. The planet is already 1C hotter than it was before industrialization., Three-quarters of the commitments made by countries under the international Paris agreement are “totally inadequate”, according to a comprehensive expert analysis. Temperatures are still rising and the world is “gravely” unprepared for disasters, crop failures, coastal flooding and heatwaves, according to another review., Under Trump, the oil and gas industry contributing heavily to the climate crisis is thriving. Oil and gas-related industries in the US are planning to build 157 new or expanded plants and expand drilling over the next five years – releasing as much greenhouse gas pollution as 50 new coal-fired power plants, according to a report from the Environmental Integrity Project., As the technology for retrieving oil and gas has advanced, with hydraulic fracturing, the cost of production has plummeted. The US is now a net exporter of oil products., Much of the expansion expected would be for feedstocks to make chemicals and plastics, explained Courtney Bernhardt, the group’s research director., Bernhardt said the oil and gas expansion would erase about 75% of the progress in the power sector since 2012., “The US is already struggling to meet climate commitments and transition to a low-carbon future,” Bernhardt said. “This analysis shows that we’re heading in the wrong direction and really need to slow emissions growth from the oil, gas and petrochemical industries.”, It’s not just climate change that is getting worse. Trump has loosened rules for clean water and air and safer chemicals.

Last year, it forced British oil multinational BP to describe how its strategy aligned with goals laid out at the 2015 Paris climate summit., Vanguard on Monday revealed that its assets under management surpassed $6tn during 2019, after a net gain of $230bn in new investments, much of it in passive investments that track stock market indices, giving it large stakes in many fossil fuel companies., It has also gained regulatory approval to launch a new UK investment advice service, adding to the funds service that it started offering in the UK in 2017., Vanguard chief executive Tim Buckley has repeatedly insisted that it will focus on engaging with companies rather than voting for action. “We have to make sure we’re talking to companies on how they are dealing with and addressing these issues, but not crossing the line and telling them what to do,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times published on Sunday., Jeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, highlighted the voting records of both BlackRock and Vanguard. Both investors opposed more than 80% of climate-related shareholder motions at fossil fuel companies between 2015 and 2019, according to Guardian analysis of data provided by Proxy Insight – far higher than many counterparts., Martin said: “Following BlackRock’s move to join CA100+, the spotlight is now firmly on Vanguard. The fact they aren’t already a member is telling of their approach to climate engagement.” , A Vanguard spokeswoman said the company had no plans to join Climate Action 100+. Another spokeswoman later said the company continued “to evaluate how our alignment with this organisation could benefit Vanguard’s investors”., The second spokeswoman said that Vanguard was taking action to address climate change, including taking part in emissions disclosure initiatives., The spokeswoman said: “While voting at shareholder meetings is important, it is only one part of the larger corporate governance process.

Scientists measure heat in joules; the amount of heat in the oceans is so large that we report it in zettajoules. What is a zettajoule? It is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules. The amount of heat we are putting into the oceans is equivalent to about five Hiroshima atom bombs of energy every second., I am part of the team of researchers that published a paper on ocean warming that shows the total heat of Earth is increasing with global heating, as scientists have predicted for decades., Each year, we take Earth’s temperature to try to determine what is happening to our climate. Each year the news is worse than the year before. There is hope, which I will discuss later. But first, let’s talk about the new study., As humans emit heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, it creates an energy imbalance. There is more heat coming in than going out. That means the Earth is out of balance, and temperatures are rising., The vast majority of the excess energy – more than 90% – ends up in the oceans. Consequently, ocean temperatures are rising, and we can measure it., Global warming is really ocean warming, and it has severe consequences. First, it makes ocean levels rise, because warming water expands. Scientists estimate that by the year 2100, oceans will be about 3ft higher than they were in the year 2000, displacing 150 million people around the world., Warmer oceans also make our weather more extreme. They supercharge typhoons and hurricanes. They make rains more deadly and flooding more severe. The rising temperatures are also threatening sea life. We are experiencing major die-offs of coral reefs, which are incredibly important to ocean biodiversity. Rising ocean water is not just a problem for fish and sea life, it is a problem for everyone., The leader of our team, Dr Lijing Cheng, developed an innovative way to measure ocean temperatures. We only get data where we place temperature sensors, and sophisticated mathematics are used to fill in the gaps and create a continuous picture of what is happening. His method of filling in the data gaps has been shown to be very accurate and scientists around the world have adopted the techniques. , Often when scientists report climate data, they try to show trends. It isn’t so important what the ocean temperatures were last year or what they will be this year. What really matters is the trend: are the oceans getting hotter or colder? Using the late 1990s as a reference, we see that years prior are colder and years after are warmer. In fact, we see that the oceans have warmed continuously since about 1990. This long-term trend is what climate breakdown looks like, and it is terrible news for the future of the planet., All reasonable people know that the climate is warming and humans are the cause. Sometimes, I am asked for proof of warming, and there are many things I can point to: ice is melting, air temperatures are increasing, sea levels are rising, etc. But the best proof of warming is in the oceans. No one can dispute the data. The oceans are unequivocally warming., So, what do we do about it? Well, we can begin to use energy more wisely. This will not only help with the climate crisis but save money as well. Secondly, we can maximise our energy from renewable sources such as wind, water, and solar. One of the things that gives me hope is that energy from solar and wind power is now cheaper than dirty coal. The benefits of solar and wind depend, of course, on how sunny or windy the conditions are, but with the drop in green energy prices, it no longer makes economic sense to build coal plants., Another bit of hope is represented by the growing actions of our youth. Make no mistake, the Greta Thunbergs of the world will change things in ways that privileged middle-aged white men like me cannot. Their generation will inherit a dire situation, but they have the passion to act, and decades of unarguable evidence that they must., So yes, 2019 set yet another dire record for Earth’s climate. But the fight continues to make the future more habitable for our children and their children.oceans are as hot as humans have known them and were to blame", "label": 0}, "train-68": {"text": "\nClimate activist turns down Siemens' offer of seat on energy board\n, Protest group leader Luisa Neubauer says she would lose right to criticise the company, \nKate Connolly in Berlin, \n\nMon 13 Jan 2020 12.03 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 07.32 EDT\n\n, The leader of Germany’s Friday for Future climate protests has said she turned down a seat on the board of Siemens’ new energy business amid growing anger over its role in a controversial coalmining project in Australia as she feared she would lose the right to criticise the company., Luisa Neubauer, 23, the German face of the campaign group inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who has campaigned alongside her, said on Monday the position would jeopardise her independence if she had taken up the offer from its chief executive, Joe Kaeser, made at a meeting in Berlin on Friday., The two met as protests by Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion were held in 40 cities across Germany, including outside Siemens’ Munich headquarters, against a central Queensland coalmine that will open up one of the world’s biggest untouched coal basins. Neubauer had hoped to persuade Kaeser to withdraw from the project, for which Siemens has won an €18m contract to provide the rail infrastructure., At the meeting in Berlin, Neubauer was offered a position by Kaeser in either the supervisory board or leadership council of Siemens Energy, a spin-off business which hopes to head a new generation of energy-efficient technology. It is due to split from the main company in the spring and to go public in September on Germany’s Dax index., She said on Monday she had turned down the offer. “If I were to take it up, I would be obliged to represent the company’s interests and could never be an independent critic of Siemens,” she explained. “That is not compatible with my role as a climate activist.”, The Carmichael mine was approved by the Austalian government in June and will be run by the Indian company Adani. It has become a cause for climate protesters who disapprove of a project which will contribute to global heating – especially at a time when large parts of Australia are already being wracked by bushfires blamed on the climate crisis., Kaeser, who has made much of the company’s pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030, last month tweeted his recognition of the activists’ complaints about the mine, promising he would “diligently look into the matter” and “get back” to the protesters. He pointed out a decision would “not be easy” due to the various interest groups involved, including shareholders, customers and the public., But on Sunday, following an extraordinary meeting of Siemens management, Kaeser announced the company was to go ahead with the project as it was legally obliged to remain committed to it, adding that at the same time it would become increasingly watchful of environmental concerns., “We have evaluated all the options and have concluded that we must fulfil our contractual obligations,” he tweeted. He promised the company would improve its future management of “protecting the environment” by establishing what he called “an effective Sustainability Board”., Activists say the coalmine project will produce an annual 27.5m  tonnes of coal and will contribute to global heating. They also point to the vast amounts of water it will require, as well as destruction of habitat and the need to transport the coal via the Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef in the world., The Australian Conservation Foundation called the decision “disastrous”, and pledged to continue its protests against the mine. It added: “With this decision, the company is showing its true face ... its climate change strategies have been revealed to be meaningless and hollow.”, Neubauer has referred to the Siemens’ project as an “inexcusable mistake”., She told the news agency DPA: “We asked Kaeser to do everything possible to stop the Adani mine. Instead he will now profit from this disastrous project., “This is so last century, and Joe Kaeser is making an unforgivable mistake,” she added, emphasising that Siemens’ decision threatened climate goals to reduce the rise in global warming by two degrees.climate activist turns down siemens offer of seat on energy board", "label": 0}, "train-69": {"text": "\nWhy do record ocean temperatures matter?\n, Everything you need to know about the significance of the heat record set last year, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nMon 13 Jan 2020 12.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Jan 2020 12.31 EST\n\n, The new record represents the most stark demonstration that global heating is unequivocally real and driving the climate crisis. With emissions still rising every year, more heat is being trapped by greenhouse gases, and the ocean data is crystal clear: an unrelenting and accelerating rise for at least the past half century. Lijing Cheng, at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: “There are no reasonable alternatives aside from the human emissions of heat-trapping gases to explain this.”, We live on the surface of the Earth, and so air temperature is the most common heat measurement. But two-thirds of the planet’s area is ocean and water can absorb far more heat than air. As a result, just 4% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases warms the air and land., So to really see what is happening with global heating, you need to look at the oceans. Here, the signal is unmistakable, with every year in the past decade recording hotter oceans that the year before, bar one. In contrast, air temperature is more affected by the natural variation that overlies human-caused global heating. The hottest year for air temperature to date is 2016, thanks to an El Niño event, though 2019 may slot in at number two when the final data is available., The oceans and atmosphere are inextricably linked. Changing ocean heat means changing rains, and that means more floods in some places and more droughts and wildfires in others. Furthermore, hotter oceans mean more sea level rise, threatening cities from Shanghai to Miami and Rio de Janeiro to Alexandria., Hotter oceans also supercharge storms, with Kevin Trenberth at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research noting that a hotspot in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017 spawned Hurricane Harvey. That led to 82 deaths and caused about $108bn in damage. In 2018, a hotspot in the Atlantic Ocean near the Carolinas led to Hurricane Florence., Many coral reefs are already suffering from bleaching. But the increasing number of ocean heatwaves are affecting all life. For example, the hot “blob” seen in the North Pacific from 2013 to 2015 caused a major loss of marine life, from plankton and fish – including 100 million cod – to marine mammals such as whales., No, but it might lead to some. Climate tipping points are reached when particular impacts of global heating become unstoppable, such as the runaway loss of ice sheets or forests, or the release of the potent greenhouse gas methane from melting tundra. Some scientists think the world may already have crossed a series of tipping points. If so, the buildup of heat graphically demonstrated in the oceans shows why., Yes. The way to end global heating and tackle the climate emergency is to stop emitting greenhouse gases. Most importantly that means a rapid end to fossil fuel burning, plus the protection and regeneration of forests and cutting down emissions from farming, in particular from cattle. There is no time to lose.why record ocean temperatures matter", "label": 0}, "train-70": {"text": "\nOcean temperatures hit record high as rate of heating accelerates\n, Oceans are clearest measure of climate crisis as they absorb 90% of heat trapped by greenhouse gases, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nMon 13 Jan 2020 11.57 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Jan 2020 07.34 EST\n\n, The heat in the world’s oceans reached a new record level in 2019, showing “irrefutable and accelerating” heating of the planet., The world’s oceans are the clearest measure of the climate emergency because they absorb more than 90% of the heat trapped by the greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel burning, forest destruction and other human activities., The new analysis shows the past five years are the top five warmest years recorded in the ocean and the past 10 years are also the top 10 years on record. The amount of heat being added to the oceans is equivalent to every person on the planet running 100 microwave ovens all day and all night., Hotter oceans lead to more severe storms and disrupt the water cycle, meaning more floods, droughts and wildfires, as well as an inexorable rise in sea level. Higher temperatures are also harming life in the seas, with the number of marine heatwaves increasing sharply., The most common measure of global heating is the average surface air temperature, as this is where people live. But natural climate phenomena such as El Niño events mean this can be quite variable from year to year., “The oceans are really what tells you how fast the Earth is warming,” said Prof John Abraham at the University of St Thomas, in Minnesota, US, and one of the team behind the new analysis. “Using the oceans, we see a continued, uninterrupted and accelerating warming rate of planet Earth. This is dire news.”, “We found that 2019 was not only the warmest year on record, it displayed the largest single-year increase of the entire decade, a sobering reminder that human-caused heating of our planet continues unabated,” said Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University, US, and another team member., The analysis, published in the journal Advances In Atmospheric Sciences, uses ocean data from every available source. Most data is from the 3,800 free-drifting Argo floats dispersed across the oceans, but also from torpedo-like bathythermographs dropped from ships in the past., The results show heat increasing at an accelerating rate as greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere. The rate from 1987 to 2019 is four and a half times faster than that from 1955 to 1986. The vast majority of oceans regions are showing an increase in thermal energy., This energy drives bigger storms and more extreme weather, said Abraham: “When the world and the oceans heat up, it changes the way rain falls and evaporates. There’s a general rule of thumb that drier areas are going to become drier and wetter areas are going to become wetter, and rainfall will happen in bigger downbursts.”, Hotter oceans also expand and melt ice, causing sea levels to rise. The past 10 years also show the highest sea level measured in records dating back to 1900. Scientists expect about one metre of sea level rise by the end of the century, enough to displace 150 million people worldwide., Dan Smale, at the Marine Biological Association in the UK, and not part of the analysis team, said the methods used are state of the art and the data is the best available. “For me, the take-home message is that the heat content of the upper layers of the global ocean, particularly to 300 metre depth, is rapidly increasing, and will continue to increase as the oceans suck up more heat from the atmosphere,” he said., “The upper layers of the ocean are vital for marine biodiversity, as they support some of the most productive and rich ecosystems on Earth, and warming of this magnitude will dramatically impact on marine life,” Smale said., The new analysis assesses the heat in the top 2,000m of the ocean, as that is where most of the data is collected. It is also where the vast majority of the heat accumulates and where most marine life lives., The analysis method was developed by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and uses statistical methods to interpolate heat levels in the few places where there was no data, such as under the Arctic ice cap. An independent analysis of the same data by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration shows that same increasing heat trend., Reliable ocean heat measurements stretch back to the middle of the 20th century. But Abraham said: “Even before that, we know the oceans were not hotter.”, “The data we have is irrefutable, but we still have hope because humans can still take action,” he said. “We just haven’t taken meaningful action yet.”ocean temperatures hit record high as rate of heating accelerates", "label": 0}, "train-71": {"text": "\nPutting Extinction Rebellion on extremist list 'completely wrong', says Keir Starmer\n, Labour leadership frontrunner joins police chiefs in denouncing the move, \nJamie Grierson, \nVikram Dodd and \nPeter Walker, \n\nMon 13 Jan 2020 11.50 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 13 Jan 2020 04.12 EST\n\n, Keir Starmer, the Labour leadership frontrunner, has branded a decision by police to include Extinction Rebellion on a list of extreme ideologies as “completely wrong and counterproductive”., The shadow Brexit secretary and former chief prosecutor in England and Wales joined police chiefs in denouncing the move – revealed in the Guardian on Friday – to put XR’s beliefs on the list of ideologies that warrant reporting someone to the Prevent programme, which seeks to stop terror attacks., His condemnation came after the home secretary, Priti Patel, defended the decision, saying it was important to look at “a range of security risks”., While accepting that XR was not a terrorist organisation, Patel told LBC radio that such an assessment had to be “based in terms of risk to the public, security risks, security threats”., Starmer, who emerged as the clear favourite for the Labour leadership among MPs on Monday with 88 nominations, said the guidance was wrong., “It’s completely wrong and counterproductive to describe Extinction Rebellion as an ‘extreme ideology’,” he told the Guardian. “I have spent a lifetime defending the right to protest – and campaigning for action on the climate crisis is hugely important.”, Starmer’s position was backed by Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow security minister, who called the decision “incomprehensible”., He said: “Climate change is a real and present danger that requires an immediate policy response; this decision further calls into question the effectiveness of the Prevent programme, of which Labour has long argued for an independent review., “Since Lord Carlile stood down as the independent reviewer following legal challenge, the government has not appointed a replacement. They must appoint someone who commands widespread confidence across different communities and carry out the robust review of Prevent that is urgently required.”, Carlile, a barrister and Liberal Democrat peer, was appointed by the Conservative government to carry out a review of Prevent, but stood down because of claims he was biased and amid a legal challenge., He too denounced the decision. The first independent reviewer of terrorism legislation from 2001-11 said the police had made an error and were right to apologise., Carlile said: “The Prevent strategy is meant to deal with violent extremism, with terrorism, and XR are not violent terrorists. They are disruptive campaigners.”, The list of extreme ideologies including XR came in a guide dated to last November produced by counter-terrorism policing south-east and was intended for police officers, government organisations and teachers, who by law have to report concerns about radicalisation., XR featured alongside threats to national security such as neo-Nazi terrorism and a pro-terrorist Islamist group. Police said including the non-violent climate emergency group was a mistake and recalled the document, but only after they discovered the Guardian had learned of it., Carlile said: “My view is it is important to distinguish between terrorism and protest. XR is mostly legitimate protest. It does not fall into the category of terrorism and the police are quite right to back down., “It is a very difficult area and it is unsurprising that mistakes are made,  … This was an error of judgment, but in this area, errors of judgment are going to be made from time to time.”, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said Patel’s comments were “indefensible”. XR has threatened legal action over the guidance., Sir Peter Fahy, who was head of Prevent from 2010 to 2015, subsequently told the Guardian that such categorisations risked Prevent losing confidence from communities., Asked about Fahy’s comments, Patel defended the Prevent programme and the police’s actions. “When it comes to anti-terrorism, Prevent and the work that the government is doing, and has done for a considerable period of time – we are constantly looking at individuals, groups,” she said. “That’s right and that’s proper. But everything has to be based and calibrated upon risk., “Sir Peter Fahy has made one comment. Quite frankly, I look at a range of security risks.”, Asked if she believed XR was a terrorist organisation, Patel replied: “No, they’re obviously a protest organisation. But everything has to be based in terms of risk to the public, security risks, security threats. That is based on information from the police, and various intelligence that we will receive. That’s the proper thing to do. You develop your policy approach accordingly.”, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said said: “The home secretary was very clear that it was considered a protest group. These are obviously matters for the police and the police set out on Friday that they were looking at this.”, XR, which has held a series of protests against the climate emergency involving blocking streets, was included in a 12-page guide produced by counter-terrorism police in the south-east titled Safeguarding Young People and Adults from Ideological Extremism, which is marked “official”., It says that issues to look out for include people who speak in “strong or emotive terms about environmental issues” and to look out for young people who “neglect to attend school” or “participate in planned school walkouts”., When the Guardian first asked police about the guidance, officials said they would review it. Following further questions, counter-terrorism police confirmed it had been circulated to “statutory partners” and had been recalled.

The scientists calculated that this increase would result in about 2,100 more fatal injuries every year in the US alone., People tend to go outside more and drink more alcohol on hotter days, while higher temperatures are known to increase rates of violence and suicide. The analysis did show a small reduction in the number of deaths related to falls among elderly people, probably because there is less ice in winter., Previous research on the impact of the climate emergency on health has focused on chronic diseases such as heart failure and infectious diseases including malaria. But deaths from injuries currently make up about 10% of all fatalities around the world and the impact of global heating on this had been little studied until now., The scientists say young people play vital roles in supporting societies and economies and that measures to tackle deaths from injury must be a public health priority., “Our results show how much climate change can affect young people,” said Prof Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London. “We need to respond to this threat with better preparedness in terms of emergency services, social support and health warnings.”, Injury deaths were expected to increase in all nations as temperatures rose, he said, although local factors would influence the extent of the increase – for example, the standard of road safety or level of gun control. The world is currently on track for a 3-4C temperature rise, suggesting the increase in injury deaths could be even higher., The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, is based on data on recorded deaths from injuries in every county in the mainland US between 1980 to 2017. It also used temperature data to find the months when the average temperature was 2C higher than usual. This enabled the researchers to account for the fact that people adapt to normal local conditions but are affected by unusual temperatures., Comparing the data allowed the scientists to estimate the annual increase in deaths that would result from a 2C rise. Men are already much more likely than women to die from injuries and the researchers found that 84% of the additional deaths were among men., The most affected age group was 15-34. Road crashes accounted for 42% of the extra deaths and suicide 30%. Deaths from violence and from drowning both made up about 14% of the total. Drownings increase in hot weather as more people swim., “There is a long history of work that shows injuries are fundamentally seasonal,” said Ezzati. “Some of this is obvious – people drown more in summer. We also know that warmth influences both our physiology and our behaviour.”, The reasons deaths from suicide and violent assault increase in hot weather are not fully understood. But the researchers said it was possible that people spending more time outdoors had a higher risk of confrontations., People also tend to be more agitated in hot weather, and may drink more alcohol, which could lead to more assaults. Previous research indicates that high temperatures are associated with higher levels of mental distress, especially in young people., Injuries already kill more that 5 million people a year, more than HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and such deaths are rising. Policies to tackle the climate emergency should include measures to combat deaths from injuries, said Shanthi Ameratunga and Alistair Woodward of the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in an accompanying commentary on the research., “The need to address this major public health problem is particularly urgent in low- and middle-income countries that experience over 80% of the global injury burden and are generally more vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather,” they said., “The public health community tend to forget that injury deaths are actually a pretty big factor in overall mortality,” said Ezzati. “The emphasis on young people is an important aspect of the story, as they are educationally and economically active.”climate crisis likely to increase violent deaths of young people report", "label": 0}, "train-73": {"text": "Sex machine: prolific Galápagos tortoise saves his species, Only 15 giant Española tortoises were left in the wild before one male sired 800 offspring in a wildly successful breeding program, The Galápagos National Park has announced it is ending a captive breeding program for giant Española tortoises, after one tortoise produced more than 800 offspring, helping save the species., When the breeding program began, just 15 representatives of the species Chelonoidis hoodensis remained in the wild on the island of Española.

The 2019 figures are also well below the average set over the last decade of 208 new projects a year. , Renewable UK warned that the UK risked falling short of its aim of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 as the pipeline of projects that clinched support before the schemes were closed begins to run dry., Rebecca Williams, a director at Renewable UK, said the figures showed that the government’s current approach was falling short on the clean electricity needed to meet the UK’s legally binding climate targets., “This is a flashing red warning light on our net zero dashboard and we urgently need a new strategy from government,” she said., The findings are likely to increase pressure on the government to reverse the block on government support for new onshore windfarms, put in place by the former Tory prime minister David Cameron in 2016., The current energy policy blocks onshore wind developers from competing for support contracts, and has caused the rollout of new onshore wind capacity to fall to 629 megawatts (MW) last year, or a quarter of the onshore wind growth recorded two years ago., The government’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has suggested that the UK’s onshore wind capacity should increase by almost threefold in the next 15 years to meet climate goals at low cost., This would require the UK to grow its onshore wind capacity from 13,000 MW now to 35,000 MW by 2035, or an average of more that 1,400MW a year., The sole addition to the UK’s fleet of onshore wind farms under the government’s current energy policy last year – the Withernwick II project, in the East Riding of Yorkshire – has a capacity of 8MW, with just four turbines., “Onshore wind is one of the cheapest low carbon technologies in the UK, quick to build, and it’s hugely popular as the government’s own opinion polls show 78% of people support it,” Williams said. “As ministers get down to work at the start of a new decade, we need to see new policies which support the full range of clean power sources to transform our energy system.”, ScottishPower, a major developer of renewable energy, has started planning for a major expansion of onshore windfarm projects across Scotland in anticipation of a government U-turn on support for wind power projects., Lindsay McQuade, the chief executive of ScottishPower Renewables, told the Guardian late last year that “if the commitment of net zero is to be a reality, I expect to see support from government to match it”.just one new onshore windfarm started up in uk in 2019", "label": 0}, "train-75": {"text": "\nSex superstar: how Diego the horny tortoise saved his species\n, There were just 14 of his kind surviving in the wild – until Diego arrived, drove the lady tortoises wild and fathered 800 babies, \n\nMon 13 Jan 2020 08.54 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 14 Jan 2020 07.09 EST\n\n, Name: Diego the horny tortoise., Age: About 100., Appearance: Roughly 5ft (1.5 metres) long, weighs 80kg (12.5st), leathery skin, long neck, large shell on his back., Occupation: Sex god., He doesn’t sound like a sex god. They say the same thing about Rod Stewart, another leathery old survivor who drives the ladies wild., What is Diego’s secret? Ebullience. He has “a big personality and is quite aggressive, active and vocal in his mating habits”, according to the US environmentalist James Gibbs, who has played a leading role in the conservation of giant tortoises in the Galápagos Islands., Remind me where the Galápagos Islands are. In the Pacific, 600 miles west of Ecuador. Read your Darwin., I take it Diego has been part of the conservation effort. His part has been in every sense enormous., Go on. In the 1970s, his species, Chelonoidis hoodensis, which is native to Española Island in the Galápagos, was down to its last 14 survivors in the wild. It was on its last stubby little legs, and threatening to follow several other giant Galápagos tortoise species into extinction., Call for Diego! Exactly. He had been sunning himself in San Diego zoo in California for 30 years after being taken from Española for scientific research, but in 1976 was returned to a breeding centre on Santa Cruz, one of the larger islands in the Galápagos. Since then, Diego has produced an estimated 800 offspring, making him an international sex superstar and saving the species., Singlehandedly? Not quite. There is another male tortoise called E5 who has fathered even more progeny, but because he doesn’t have a proper name and tends to be more discreet in his lovemaking he has been largely ignored. Branding is everything in the celebrity tortoise world., What now for Diego? Much-deserved retirement. The giant tortoise population on Española has been deemed self-sustaining, the breeding programme on Santa Cruz is being closed down and Diego can go home to his native island after almost 80 years away., Oh, how sweet. What about E5? Who knows? He’s not the story!, OK, well, how do giant tortoises mate? Noisily., What’s their favourite chat-up line? “A word in your shell-like.”, How do they arrange dates? By shellphone., Not to be confused with: Lonesome George, a Pinta Island tortoise who was the last member of his species, Chelonoidis abingdonii.

It comes after countries largely failed to meet targets for the previous decade agreed in Aichi, Japan, in 2010., As well as calling for a commitment to protect at least 30% of the planet, the 20-point draft plan, which has been likened to the 2015 Paris agreement on the climate crisis, aims to introduce controls on invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%., The draft text has been welcomed by environmental campaigners, who have called on governments to treat the targets outlined in the accord as the minimum acceptable level for which to aim., The director of Campaign for Nature, Brian O’Donnell, said: “Today’s draft shows that countries are listening and that they recognise the increasingly important role that protecting land and water must play in confronting climate change, preventing wildlife extinctions, and supporting people and local communities. This is a very encouraging first step., “Much work remains to be done in the coming months to ensure that the rights of indigenous people are advanced, and bold conservation and finance targets are included in the final agreement.”, By 2030, the trade in wild species must be legal and sustainable, according to the draft document, which also aims to promote the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities in decision-making about biodiversity., Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms and all its interactions.  “Without biodiversity, there is no future for humanity,” says Prof David Macdonald, at Oxford University. It is comprised of several levels, starting with genes, then individual species, then communities of creatures and finally entire ecosystems, such as forests or coral reefs, where life interplays with the physical environment. , Without plants there would be no oxygen and without bees to pollinate there would be no fruit or nuts. The services provided by ecosystems are estimated to be worth trillions of dollars – double the world’s GDP. Biodiversity loss in Europe alone is estimated to cost the continent about 3% of its GDP, or €450m (£400m), a year., The extinction rate of species is now thought to be about 1,000 times higher than before humans dominated the planet, which may be even faster than the losses after a giant meteorite wiped out the dinosaurs 65m years ago. The sixth mass extinction in geological history has already begun, according to some scientists. Billions of individual populations have been lost, with the number of animals living on Earth having plunged by half since 1970. Researchers call the massive loss of wildlife a “biological annihilation”. , Changes to the climate are reversible, even if that takes centuries or millennia – but once species become extinct, there’s no going back., The planned agreement forms part of a long-term international framework that aims to ensure biodiversity is sustainably valued and conserved by 2050., Enric Sala, explorer-in-residence at National Geographic, and co-author of the Global Deal for Nature, said: “If adopted, this target could achieve what our children have been calling on governments to do – listen to the science. If we are to stay below 1.5C (2.7F), prevent the extinction of 1 million species and the collapse of our life support system, we need to protect our intact wilderness, and ensure at least 30% of our land and oceans are protected by 2030., “But this is the floor, not the ceiling. Now every government on Earth must get behind this bold mission and drive through a global agreement for nature this year.”, In May, the world’s leading scientists warned that nature is being destroyed at a rate up to hundreds of times higher than the average for the previous 10 million years, due to human activity., The destruction of the planet’s coral reefs, rainforests and other vital ecosystems have placed human society in jeopardy, with the report’s authors warning of “ominous” consequences such as freshwater shortages and climate instability unless radical action is taken., • This article was amended on 15 January 2020. An earlier version included an absolute temperature conversion, of 1.5C to 34.7F, rather than converting a temperature rise of 1.5C, which is a rise of 2.7F.

It was described as the largest coordinated action of its kind and for a few hours the oil stopped flowing., The five climate activists, members of Climate Direct Action, cut their way through fencing and turned the valves. The activists notified the energy companies whose pipelines were being disrupted and posted videos of their protest online and waited patiently to be arrested., They have since been dubbed the “Valve Turners”, profiled in the New York Times magazine and featured in a recent documentary titled The Reluctant Radical. Their trials have also tested the willingness of courts to allow climate activists to make use of the necessity defense – the idea that a criminal action is justified if it helps to prevent greater future harm – as part of a legal strategy., But the group’s actions attracted the attention of the DHS., In a recent intelligence bulletin evaluating domestic terrorism threats between 2018 and 2020, the department included the Valve Turners and described the group as “suspected environmental rights extremists”., The document also listed two of the group’s members alongside violent white supremacists and other extremists who have engaged in mass killings, including the man behind the racist 2015 slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina., The document obtained by the not-for-profit Property of the People through a Foia request defines domestic terrorism as “any act of violence that is dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources” and that is intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or government body. The assessment is directed at departmental leadership and is based on a review of roughly 80 violent incidents between 2014 and 2017, according to the document., The document points to an uptick in “sabotage attacks” conducted by anarchist extremists, environmental rights and animal rights extremists against the Dakota Access pipeline in 2016 at the height of the pipeline protest. Nearly 800 activists have been tried on a variety of North Dakota state charges, in relation to the pipeline protests, according to Water Protector Legal Collective, a legal support organization., This activity was met with heavy law enforcement presence, FBI and DHS surveillance, and aggressive military style tactics deployed by pipeline security contractors. , In addition to providing an overview of domestic terrorism threats the document includes an appendix summarizing select incidents over the past few years. Two of the Valve Turners are listed alongside violent white supremacists such as Dylann Roof and James Fields, who have both been convicted of murdering innocent civilians. Roof killed nine black churchgoers in a rampage in South Carolina. Fields drove his car into a group of activists protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one and injuring at least 19 others., The document also states that “racial and environmentally themed ideologies” were among the primary drivers of terrorist attacks in the United States during this time., Mike German, a former FBI agent who is now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote in an email that ,  the DHS framing was “highly misleading because white supremacists are responsible for the bulk of this violence and almost all of the fatalities that result”. “There is little evidence,” he added, “that environmentalists have engaged in the types of deadly violence that would meet the statutory definition of domestic terrorism, as codified by Congress”., The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment., Sam Jessup, one of the activists named in the document, said the bulletin shed light on the role law enforcement and intelligence agencies have played in suppressing dissent., “Equating mass murder by white supremacists with what Michael and I did is totally obscene,” Jessup said in an email. “This whole infrastructure of so-called security has done little more than secure the future of the fossil fuel industry by terrorizing people into silence.”, Jessup, 34, served as a driver and videographer, live-streaming the action in North Dakota. Michael Foster, a former family therapist who lives in Seattle, turned the valve., Foster said even though the action involved a high level of legal risk, it was a small price to pay in light of the cascading impacts of climate change., “The only way to force society to change fast enough is to refuse to participate and fill the jails,” Foster said., Both he and Jessup were convicted on felony conspiracy charges and Foster spent six months in jail. During closing arguments the prosecutor compared Foster to the Unabomber and the 9/11 hijackers. He is now on probation and barred from engaging in direct action protest for another two years., In the more than three years since the action , several states have passed legislation making it a crime to trespass on property containing critical infrastructure.The Trump administration has advocated for stiffer penalties against activists who engage in non-violent direct action targeting fossil fuel infrastructure., Carl Williams, executive director of the Water Protector Legal Collective, which has defended a number of DAPL protesters, says the push to criminalize dissent is part of a larger rightwing strategy that has also targeted the BDS movement and Black Lives Matter., “I think there is a strategy that rightwing forces are using to criminalize dissent,” Williams said. “This bulletin shows that dirty hand.”, But Williams also says it shows that these same movements are making inroads. “Liberation movements know that this is happening and we’re fighting against it,” he said. “They’re doing this because they’re afraid of the power of these movements.”, Adam Federman is a reporting fellow with Type Investigations.us listed climate activist group extremists", "label": 0}, "train-79": {"text": "Half of UK universities have committed to divest from fossil fuel, 78 out of 154 universities joined campaign in blow to big oil’s ‘social licence’, campaigners say, Half of UK universities have signed up to divest from fossil fuels in what campaigners say is a significant blow to the “social licence” of big oil., Seventy-eight of the UK’s 154 public universities have joined the divestment campaign, either divesting or pledging to divest hundreds of millions from the fossil fuel industry., Although some of the universities have only withdrawn from certain fossil fuels – such as tar sands or coal – others have already divested from all fossil fuels as part of what campaigners say it is an accelerating process of delegitimisation of the industry., Chris Saltmarsh from the campaign group People &amp; Planet said excluding the industry from universities was now “a mainstream and majority position”., “That universities across the sector are now divesting so fully and quickly demonstrates how far the fossil fuel industry’s social license has been eroded over the last seven years.

So why does President Bolsonaro want to make them legal?, by  Dom Phillips, Yanomami indigenous reserve, Brazil, \n\nMon 13 Jan 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 13 Jan 2020 06.32 EST\n\n, Deep in the Yanomami indigenous reserve on the northern reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, the ruins of an illegal goldminers’ camp emerge after an hour in a small plane and two in a boat. No roads reach here., Wooden frames alongside the Uraricoera River that once supported shops, bars, restaurants, a pharmacy, an evangelical church and even brothels are all that is left of the small town. The army burned and trashed it as part of an operation aimed at stamping out wildcat mining on the reserve. , The army may have taken away the town, but they left the garimpeiros, as the miners are called, who this morning are hunched around a freezer, waiting for the soldiers camped downriver to leave so they can get back to work. Up to 20,000 garimpeiros are estimated by Brazilian NGO Instituto Socioambiental to have invaded this reserve, where mining and unauthorised outsiders are currently prohibited. But the garimpeiros may not remain unauthorised for long: the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to legalise their work with a bill in Congress., “I know it is illegal,” says Bernardo Gomes, 59, sitting by the frame of a bar. Formerly a worker at mining giant Vale, Gomes says his time at the company taught him how to protect the environment. “Today, unfortunately, I am helping to destroy it,” he says, explaining that a nearby patch of dead trees was suffocated by mud sucked out of the nearby mining pit., Some of his companions decline to talk, including a young woman who arrives carrying a bottle of whiskey and a speaker playing pop music. “Want a photo? Naked?” she jokes., In eight days reporting from different locations in the Yanomami reserve, the Guardian saw numerous mining pits and barges. Camps and bases had been destroyed along the Uraricoera – but its banks still teemed with outsiders., With 9.6m hectares (23.7m acres) of wild forest – an area bigger than Portugal – Yanomami is Brazil’s largest reserve. A fifth of its indigenous population died from diseases after 40,000 garimpeiros flooded the reserve in the 1980s, according to Survival International. The miners were expelled and the area declared a reserve in 1992 following a campaign by Survival, photographer Claudia Andujar and Davi Kopenawa, director of the Hutukara Yanomami Association, which invited the Guardian to visit the reserve., But the current garimpeiro invasion worsened after Bolsonaro took office. The president has said the reserve is too big for its population of around 26,000 indigenous people, and its mineral riches should be exploited. His ministers have met garimpo leaders., But garimpeiros bring malaria, prostitution and violence, indigenous leaders argue, while scientists say the mercury the miners use to separate gold particles from mud and silt enters rivers and the food chain. Their pits and barges upset ecosystems, scare away wildlife, and fill rivers with mud that distorts fish behaviour and breeding., Indigenous people used to call this upriver region Paixão de Mutum – or Curassow’s Passion – after the large, pheasant-like bird they hunted here. Now it is known as Tatuzão – Big Armadillo – for the pits that miners have gouged out of the forest. Miners have replaced the mutum., “Somebody should help us. The government doesn’t care, it wants to finish indigenous people off,” says Geraldo Magalhães, 42, a Ye’kwana indigenous man and deputy chief of Waikás village, a two-hour boat-ride away. In November leaders of the majority Yanomami and much smaller Ye’kwana tribes sent a letter to Bolsonaro. “We do not want garimpo and mining on our land,” it said. “Garimpo out!”, Funai, the national agency which works to protect indigenous lands, plans to reopen three bases in the reserve. But repeated army operations have failed to shift the miners., Just a few minutes upriver from the ruined camp, work has already resumed in an enormous mining pit, where tarpaulin and scaffolding made of logs and twine hold up a bank of earth. Three men toil waist-deep in mud with a hose jetting water under an uprooted tree. Mud pours down a rough wooden sluice, while black smoke belches from a deafening diesel engine: a hand-operated industrial hell amid the wild tropical beauty., “We are here to get gold. These are our riches,” says garimpeiro Fredson Pedrosa, 40. “Everyone here is counting on the army leaving so they can work again.”, The men are from small towns in Brazil’s impoverished north and north-east, where they say minimum-salary wages of around US$250 a month (£194) are barely enough to live on. “You do this to keep your family,” says Denilson Nascimento, 33., Garimpeiros say they voted for Bolsonaro after he promised to legalise their trade. “We know it damages the environment,” says Antonio Almeida, 24, who runs a bar here. “But there is a lot of nature, no way you can kill it all.”, Wildcat mining is deeply entwined with local life in Waikás. Four villagers work as boatmen for the miners, others sell food at Tatuzão and two run a smaller mining site nearby. Tolls on the garimpo boats paid for generators, boat motors and televisions., “The garimpo is a reality and they’re used to it,” says Edmilson Estevão, 33, who was raised in the village and works for the Ye’kwana association Wanasseduume. Some villagers work with the mining, others reject it, but the Ye’kwana keep their differences to themselves. “Same family, same blood,” he says., The garimpo has impacted heavily on hunting, fishing and water quality. “The prey is getting further and further away. Fish are disappearing, and are contaminated with mercury,” says Júlio Ye’kwana, 39, Wanasseduume’s president. “Wild pigs used to live around the village. Not anymore.”, When mining in the Tatuzão area was operating at full pelt, the river where children bathe and families collect water thickened with mud. “The water was very dirty,” says Nivaldo Edamya, 34, the village chief. “What garimpo does is bad. Deforestation, various diseases, that’s why I am against them.”, Academic research on the impacts of garimpo – or Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) – on biodiversity backs up these complaints., Marcelo Oliveira, a conservation specialist at the World Wildlife Fund has found high mercury levels in fish as far as 150km from ASGM sites in the Amazon. He and other researchers found mercury in Amazon river dolphins – nearly half of those studied had dangerously high levels – and other researchers found record mercury levels in jaguar fur near ASGM sites in the Brazilian Pantanal. “This is an invisible problem,” he says., Birds and larger mammals are sensitive to changes in forest cover and vegetation and flee garimpo areas, says David Lutz, a US-based research assistant professor in environmental studies at Dartmouth College who has studied ASGM in the Peruvian Amazon for a decade. “Massive disturbance. This is like a bomb going off. This is as drastic as you’ll see,” he says, after viewing photos of Tatuzão., A study carried out by Lutz and colleagues in Peru found water quality was severely impacted near ASGM sites. Mud and silt thickened rivers, reducing visibility, which would disturb seasonal behaviour and even the breeding habits of fish and the life cycles of insects. “There is a handful of species that can handle this change, so those species become dominant and it lowers the numbers of other species,” says Lutz., Near Waikás, two rough-hewn wooden barges used to dredge for gold are hidden in a tributary. Banks of sand, stones and mud sucked up by the barges had formed in the river. “They are reshaping the river structure,” says Lutz. “This will really change the sediment.”, In the 1980s and 1990s, William Milliken, an ethnobotanist at Kew Gardens documented the impacts in Yanomami areas degraded by ASGM, such as disappearing caiman and a reduction in plants such as fish poison vine. “It’s likely to happen again,” he said., The mercury that miners use to separate gold particles from mud and silt is dumped into rivers and burned off into the air, says Luis Fernandez, a tropical ecologist and director at the Wake Forest University centre for Amazon Scientific Innovation in the US., Mercury spreads into the aquatic ecosystem via a process called biomagnification and concentrates rapidly as it passes up the food chain. , “The food chain acts like a signal amplifier,” he says. “Environmental chemistry in the tropics is much faster than in temperate regions.”, A study published in 2018 found that 92% of indigenous people in a village near Waikás, where a garimpo site operated, had higher than safe levels of mercury in their hair. In Waikás, the level was 28%. “Here, all the garimpeiros use it mercury,” says one miner., An hour’s flight across the rolling hills of jungle from Waikás – passing over a garimpo pit and camp with its own vegetable garden – brings you to the health post at Maloca Paapiú. The Yanomami people it serves live in communal houses of extended families deep in thick forest, reached by muddy, winding trails. Here, men and women use black and red face and body paint and women wear short skirts of fronds, bamboo spears in their noses and cheeks; barefoot children skip nimbly across the slippery logs that serve as bridges across numerous streams and rivers., Garimpeiros overran the region in the late 1980s. Now they are inching closer again. , Noemia Yanomama, 40, says she saw a garimpo camp near the hills where she hunts. She worries young indigenous men will bring sexual diseases from prostitutes in the camps. “Soon they will get close to the community. That makes me very sad,” she says., Young men and teenage boys gather daily at the health post to charge cellphones they bought working on garimpo sites reached by hours of walking. One site abandoned this year was just a few hours away., This is creating a generational divide with their parents, who still hunt with bows and arrows. “The garimpo is not our friend. We call it a disease,” says Tibiana Yanomama, 42., His son Oziel, 15, escaped to the nearest garimpo with his friend Marcos, 21. Both spent three weeks working there, clearing jungle, before Tibiana went and dragged them back., “I wanted shoes, a machete, a sharpening file,” Marcos says. “I wanted a hammock. I wanted to work.” He was paid five grams of gold (worth around $180). He saw garimpeiros working with mercury and drank beer and sugar cane rum. “I got very drunk,” he says, with a nervous laugh., Tibiana is furious with Oziel. “The youth don’t listen,” he says.

We took the dog and set out across the sand at Scapa, the low midwinter sun casting moody shadows across the foreshore, each hollow and footprint picked out in charcoal, and the sky awash with pale hues: duck egg, buttermilk and apricot., The sea was unsettled, spume sinking exhausted into the sand. Oil rigs and tankers standing sentinel to the south were silhouetted on the horizon in a hazy grey, blocky and strange as a fata morgana., The dog scampered along the high-tide line, where bladderwrack and kelp lay tangled. We found her investigating a pane of mottled silver. It took me a moment to place it. Seal skin – a swatch of flank from a body half buried in the sand. And down the beach, another prone shape, then another. One pewter, with a dark patina, the second dappled like a horse. Neither had a head. It was strange to see them: their sleek, glossy shape, and then – neckline falling open like a bag – their contents pouring out upon the sand, thin pink streamers of flesh and the knotted rope of vertebrae., This winter, there has been a spate of headless seals washing up along the north-east coast of Scotland. To begin with, they caused a minor panic. The 11 “mutilated” pups reported along the Dornoch Firth in December were initially assumed to have been shot and decapitated., It’s not the first time such an alarm has been sounded. Back in 2010, scores of seals bearing distinctive lacerations washed up in Norfolk and east Scotland. The mystery was only solved in 2015 when the Seal Mammal Research Institute saw a bull seal attacking, then eating, seal pups. Cannibalism, this suggested, was far more common than realised., These poor souls on the Scapa sands were perhaps victims of a seal serial killer too; or else they died of natural causes (as half of pups do, during their first winter) then lost their heads to the waves.

That is the equivalent of more than 40 heart and circulatory disease deaths related to air pollution every day., The British Heart Foundation (BHF), which compiled the figures, said there are an estimated 11,000 deaths per year at the moment, but that this will rise as the population continues to age. It wants the UK to adopt World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on air pollution and meet them by 2030., Current EU limits – which the UK comfortably meets – for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution are 25μg/m3 as an annual average. The WHO limits are tougher, at 10μg/m3 as an annual average., The BHF said PM2.5 can have a “seriously detrimental effect to heart health”, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke and making existing health problems worse., Jacob West, executive director of healthcare innovation at the BHF, said: “Every day, millions of us across the country are inhaling toxic particles which enter our blood and get stuck in our organs, raising our risk of heart attacks and stroke. Make no mistake, our toxic air is a public health emergency, and we haven’t done enough to tackle this threat to our society., “We need to ensure that stricter, health-based air quality guidelines are adopted into law to protect the health of the nation as a matter of urgency. Clean air legislation in the 1950s and 1960s, and more recently the smoking ban in public places, show that government action can improve the air we breathe.” , In July 2019, the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs published a study showing that meeting WHO guidelines on air pollution was “technically feasible” in most areas of the UK by 2030., The BHF has launched a new campaign, You’re Full Of It, to highlight how people are inhaling dangerous levels of PM2.5 in towns and cities across the UK every day., The environment minister, Rebecca Pow, said: “We all know the impact that air pollution has on communities around the UK, which is why the government is stepping up the pace and taking urgent action to improve air quality., “Alongside our Clean Air Strategy, which has been praised by the World Health Organisation as ‘an example for the rest of the world to follow’, our landmark Environment Bill will include a commitment to a legally binding target on fine particulate matter which will improve the quality of millions of people’s lives.”, NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: “The climate emergency is also a health emergency, with thousands of avoidable deaths and hospital admissions every year linked to air pollution, which is why the NHS is playing its part by taking action to reduce carbon emissions, including cutting traffic by reducing the need for millions of hospital appointments through better services., “With air pollution contributing to around 40,000 deaths a year and four in 10 children at school in high-pollution communities, it’s clear that tackling air pollution needs to be everyone’s urgent business.”air pollution kill 160000 next decade report", "label": 0}, "train-84": {"text": "Disinformation on Australian bushfires should not be spread by ministers, We write as scientists alarmed that a minister has ignored scientific evidence, relying instead on grossly misleading social media sources. In the House of Commons on 9 January, Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister Heather Wheeler answered a question about the Australian bushfires by stating: “Very regrettably, it is widely reported on social media that 75% of the fires were started by arsonists.”, The claim that arson is a primary cause of this season’s bushfires has been comprehensively debunked: fire officers report that the majority of blazes were started by dry lightning storms. Nevertheless, social media is awash with false claims about the role of arson, obscuring the link between climate change and bushfires (Disinformation and lies are spreading faster than Australia’s bushfires, 11 January)., However fires start, they burn more severely because Australia is suffering extreme conditions which are directly linked to anthropogenic climate change: 2019 was the country’s hottest and driest year ever, with the temperature 1.5C above the long-term average. The Australian government was advised in 2008 that the effects of climate change on the fire seasons “should be directly observable by 2020”., We ask that ministers rely on expert advice rather than social media. Beyond the present situation in Australia, it is important to acknowledge the role of climate change in many other circumstances worldwide, including in the UK., As host of this year’s UN climate talks, the UK government is responsible for keeping the Paris agreement on track.

We think they’re going to lose us money, not make us money.”, Bracks said: “All the companies we invest in understand they have to have a long-term sustainable future and they have to assess the risk of climate change within that., “They know that there will be some stranded assets – particularly in energy generation – if we don’t get the right economic settings for investment in generation in the future, and so they’re really taking the lead and doing the work that the government should be doing.” , As well as pushing corporate Australia to take environmental, social and governance issues more seriously, including by serving as a member of a string of investor groups, Atkin also piloted Cbus through two royal commissions., The trade union royal commission, set up by the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, after the 2013 election criticised Cbus and Atkin over the leak of personal information about fund members to the construction union – before itself giving confidential Cbus documents to other parties., But Cbus skated through 2018’s banking royal commission after counsel assisting, Michael Hodge, QC, decided not to call any witnesses from the fund., Instead Hodge and the commissioner, Kenneth Hayne, held hearings that demolished the reputations of the for-profit sector – an outcome that embarrassed the government, which had included superannuation in the inquiry’s terms of reference in a bid to embarrass industry funds over their links to the unions., “We were to be called and they did not call us in the end and they were quite satisfied with the procedures we had in place, and that’s a good thing,” Bracks said., “So we take that as a seal of approval, but more than that the royal commission as it turns out was a great boon for industry funds, and certainly in our fund we had something like $1bn of net inflows extra compared to the previous year over the period of the royal commission.”scott morrison in danger of becoming a climate change casualty says steve bracks", "label": 0}, "train-86": {"text": "\nCutting air passenger duty to help Flybe could wreck UK carbon plan\n, Frequent flyer levy and cheaper trains would help with environmental pledges – but neither is planned, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nTue 14 Jan 2020 09.49 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 15 Jan 2020 04.55 EST\n\n, Travel from Exeter to Manchester next Wednesday, and a round trip with the airline Flybe returning the next day would cost you £68, of which air passenger duty amounts to £26. A train ticket for the same journey would cost £141., This kind of price disparity between domestic flights and rail journeys has been the norm for years, the result of under-investment in railways and rail fares allowed to rise at rates much higher than inflation, while regional airports and airlines receive publicly funded incentives and tax breaks on fuel. It comes despite the government’s much-vaunted green policies, and its repeated goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050., Given these price differences, and the woeful state of many of the UK’s railways, it is easy to see why the UK’s aviation sector is set to become the country’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, if left unchecked. That would blow apart the country’s carbon budgets and the net zero commitment., The Committee on Climate Change, writing to the government last year, warned: “Plausible options for how aviation could become zero carbon, even by mid-century, are lacking. Given a population that is anticipated to grow and rising incomes, some growth in aviation demand is expected. However, this cannot be unfettered.”, If the government presses ahead with plans to cut air passenger duty from domestic flights, as it is proposing in attempts to ensure the survival of Flybe, that would also send the wrong signal to the markets, argues Sam Fankhauser, director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “Air passenger duty is applied as a green tax, based broadly on the principle that the polluter pays. Cutting or removing it would essentially reduce or eliminate the carbon price for flying.”, Air travel has been regarded as if it is a really precious economic sector', As price comparisons show, air passenger duty at its current rate is at nowhere near the price that would be needed to tip the economic balance away from air travel. Indeed, according to the veteran flying campaigner Leo Murray, director of innovation at the climate charity Possible, that was never the intention., “It was designed not to have an impact on demand for air travel,” he said. “They governments do not want it to reduce demand. Air travel has been regarded as if it is a really precious economic sector.”, Air passenger duty, or APD, is a British tax on aviation, introduced in 1994. It is charged on each passenger on flights departing from the UK, and set according to the distance of their final destination and the class of travel., It is intended to incentivise passengers to seek alternative arrangements from flying, which is the most carbon-intensive form of transport. By reducing demand for flights, it seeks to decrease carbon emissions from the air industry., Destinations are grouped into two bands, above and below 2,000 miles from London, and charged at three rates – effectively for economy class, premium economy and business/first-class seats. All short-haul flights to Europe, including domestic, are charged in the same band, rising from £13 in economy to £78 in first class. A long-haul first-class flight now attracts APD of £528., Airlines have long lobbied against the tax, particularly after the rates were doubled in 2007., Flybe has argued that it is especially hard hit as the tax only applies to UK departures, and is therefore applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at £26, while an international return flight from the UK to Moscow pays £13 in APD., Long-haul flights from Northern Ireland are exempt from APD, as well as departures from remote parts of Scotland., Yet the entire sector contributes only about £20bn to £30bn to the national economy, according to estimates, and leisure trips taken abroad by UK residents far outnumber those by tourists coming to the UK. Murray points to a deficit of about £23bn when the amount overseas tourists spend in the UK is subtracted from the amount British holidaymakers spend abroad., That means, he says, there is economic space for far higher air passenger duty in the leisure sector. Long-haul business flyers could also pay far more without being discouraged from flying, as air passenger duty barely makes a difference to them. “We are bleeding money out of the country, and you could repatriate some of that by encouraging people to stay in the UK,” he says., One of the fairest ways to curb emissions from flying would be a frequent flyer levy. The majority of flights are taken by a small minority of people – in a given year, most people in the UK do not fly at all, and most of those who do are taking one or perhaps two return flights on holiday. One-fifth of overseas flights are taken by just 1% of the population. The airline industry is kept afloat by well-off people spending more on their leisure, taking advantage of low prices to jet off frequently on short trips., A frequent flyer levy would allow people a small number of flights a year without charge or at a small charge, while each subsequent flight would attract a much higher toll. Critics say it could penalise people in the outer edges of the UK, such as the north of Scotland or Northern Ireland. But there could be ways to manage those impacts while ensuring that the environmental cost of cheap flights is accounted for., Encouraging rail travel could also play a big role in reducing emissions from domestic aviation. Germany has just slashed the price of rail travel, to encourage people to use the lower-carbon form of transport. Even more radically, France is considering restrictions or even a ban on some domestic flights., Both those countries have well developed high-speed rail networks, however, which have benefited from public investment over decades. The UK has only one short stretch of high-speed rail, in the south-east, and plans for HS2 are still mired in controversy., This November, the UK will host the crunch UN climate conference, COP26, in Glasgow, and the government’s green policies will be scrutinised on the international stage. As ministers consider cutting air passenger duty on domestic flights while regions compete for what is likely to be limited investment in the national rail networks, a coherent green transport policy looks further away than ever.government fails on green transport policies despite promises", "label": 0}, "train-87": {"text": "\nExperts study first orca stranding in England and Wales since 2001\n, Discovery of dead juvenile killer whale is first confirmed stranding in nearly 20 years, PA Media, \n\nTue 14 Jan 2020 09.05 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 14 Jan 2020 15.50 EST\n\n, Experts are investigating the first confirmed stranding of an orca in England and Wales for almost 20 years, the Zoological Society of London has said., The juvenile male killer whale, approximately 15ft long, became stranded in salt marsh in the Wash on the east coast of England., It is the first confirmed orca stranding that the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, of which ZSL is a partner, has investigated in England and Wales since 2001., Orcas are a priority species for research by ZSL as they are top predators that can absorb significant concentrations of marine pollutants, such as chemicals known as PCBs, which accumulate as they go up the food chain., ZSL’s Rob Deaville and Matt Perkins collected blubber, liver, muscle and kidney samples from the mammal, which was internally mostly intact despite its decomposed condition, having probably died weeks ago., Tests will analyse the samples for marine contaminants, while genetic analysis will help determine which population the animal came from, and teeth have been collected to accurately assess its age., The experts said there was no evidence of recent feeding as its stomachs were largely empty.

Consumers get through 20bn packs of toothpaste every year with discarded tubes contributing to the plastic pollution crisis., But Colgate’s new Smile for Good brand, which has also been certified by the Vegan Society, comes in a tube made from high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is the same plastic as milk containers., Colgate said its engineers had figured out a way to turn the hard plastic, which is widely recyclable, into a “comfortably squeezable” tube., The technology will be shared with rivals, Colgate-Palmolive said, as part of its commitment to reduce usage of what is one of the most widely used forms of plastic packaging that cannot be recycled., However, the green toothpaste, which is on sale in Waitrose and Boots, comes at a high price. At £5 for 75ml, Smile for Goods costs more than six times as much as a regular tube of Colgate., Colgate-Palmolive’s chief executive, Noel Wallace, said: “Colgate wants to make tubes a part of the circular economy by keeping this plastic productive and eliminating waste. If we can standardise recyclable tubes among all companies, we all win. We can align on these common standards for tubes and still compete with what’s inside them.”, Colgate has also taken the unusual step of listing the toothpaste’s ingredients on the tube alongside a simple explanation of their function. Consumers trying to buy greener products were confused by the role of the various ingredients, the company said. While the role of fluoride is probably well understood, the tube explains that silica cleans and polishes while glycerin prevents the paste from drying out., As concern grows about the impact of single-use plastic on the environment, manufacturers and retailers have begun to tackle their substantial footprints. Colgate-Palmolive, which also owns the Palmolive and Sanex brands, has said the packaging on all its products will be 100% recyclable by 2025., Last year Unilever said it would halve its use of virgin plastic by creating greener versions of its household products, a shift that could make shampoo refill stations, cardboard deodorant sticks and toothpaste tablets the norm in supermarkets.colgate launches vegan certified toothpaste in recyclable tube", "label": 0}, "train-89": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a black swan cuts a lonely figure\n, Rodley, West Yorkshire: The hostility of mute swans, harsh winters and the bad luck rumour might explain why these birds have never found a foothold here, \nRichard Smyth, \n\nTue 14 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, It stopped being dark at about eight o’clock this morning, but it never got exactly light.

Asked on Wednesday about his message to backbenchers who continue to dispute the science, Morrison said “every member of parliament ... has a right to speak their mind”., Here’s what MPs have been saying., A serial and constant denier of climate change, the New South Wales MP most recently made international headlines when he called a British meteorologist an “ignorant pommie weather girl” after openly denying the existence of climate change., “Well firstly there is no link, the facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment and on this our climate scientists down here have been very clear and they have said that there is no link between drought and climate change.”, Kelly doubled down on his comments in an interview with Piers Morgan in the midst of the bushfire crisis., Just hours after Andrews’ comments, Kelly was back on Facebook denying Australia could do anything in terms of lowering emissions which “will have any measurable effect on global temperatures, sea levels or bad weather”., He may have to limit his views to his social media though. Government MPs say Kelly has been encouraged to once again avoid interviews – he was previously stopped from appearing on the ABC’s Q&amp;A program before the 2019 election campaign., The Queensland MP continues to point to debunked and false theories that arson is to blame for the majority of blazes this summer. He also openly and consistently disputes the link between climate change and worsening disasters and “hat tips” Kelly for his work in this space, linking to Kelly’s posts., Spent a bit of time yesterday digging around on the public pages of Liberal and National MPs to see what they've been saying during the fires. The overwhelming majority are either posting useful donation/emergency info or not posting. Then there's these two. pic.twitter.com/GrzaoGWogI, Unashamedly pro-coal, the Queensland senator declared it had been “such an honour to represent the Australian mining sector” when he briefly stepped down from the ministry, during the section 44 constitutional issues which weighed down the previous parliament., While agreeing that Australia should reduce carbon emissions, he also told the ABC on 12 December: “What I don’t agree with is that doing so in Australia would significantly or at all reduce bushfire risk., “I don’t think you can at all, at this stage, link individual events to particular outcomes. The fires have not started due to climate change.”, After leading the charge against the carbon price, Joyce has since acknowledged climate change is real and happening. Yet he continues to float debunked theories., “There are a range of things that affect the climate and, on a global scale, you should be part of it, and acknowledge it would have an effect and I acknowledge that there are other issues as well,” he told Sky News on 11 November., “There’s just the oscillation of the seasons. There’s a change in the magnetic field of the sun.”, Another Queensland rightwinger, Rennick made headlines during the 2019 election campaign for accusing the weather bureau of rewriting records as part of the “global warming agenda”., After his surprise election to the Senate, Rennick doubled down on his views during a November 2019 interview with Sky News., “Yeah, it is a serious accusation. And I’ll stand by it,” he said. “I don’t believe the record, the changing records and the way they’ve gone about it.”, As the bushfire season took hold, Rennick continued to use his social media to deny the impact of humans on climate change., The NT senator insists it is the Greens’ agenda which led “to these horrible fires”., At a point in time when we are witnessing first hand the catastrophic loss of an estimated one billion animals, the Greens still push their ridiculous agenda.

of funding to climate change adaptation body condemned\n, National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility funding was discontinued in 2017, while Scott Morrison was treasurer , \nPaul Karp, \n\nWed 15 Jan 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Jan 2020 01.22 EST\n\n, The Coalition’s decision to axe funding to a climate change adaptation research body in 2017 has left Australia “not well positioned” to deal with fires, the “silent killer” of drought and other global heating impacts, its director has said., Jean Palutikof, the director of the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF), told Guardian Australia the decision to discontinue funding in 2017 – when Scott Morrison was treasurer – had hollowed out the research community and “the capacity to take action on climate change is smaller than it was decade ago”., Palutikof made the comments as Scott Morrison and the science minister, Karen Andrews, attempt to shift debate from the link between climate change and bushfires to strategies for “adaptation and resilience”., The research facility at Griffith University was a Howard government initiative, funded in the 2008 budget by the Rudd government and continued under the Abbott government with $9m over three years in the 2014 budget., According to the environment department, the body has produced 144 adaptation research projects since 2008 with a total of $56.3m in federal funding., But in 2017, the Coalition gave the body just $600,000 to continue its existing online platforms that inform decision makers seeking to adapt to changes in climate, with no ongoing federal funding from 2018., Palutikof said the funding cut had forced it to axe conferences for researchers and community workshops informing business, local government and citizens about their exposure to climate risk., Palutikof warned that – although bushfire cooperative research centres have continued to receive funding – bushfire is “not the only risk”, citing drought and other natural disasters such as floods., “I worry if it starts to rain and bushfires cease to be an immediate risk some money will be pumped in and then we’ll forget about it,” she said. “The government will call it adaptation and resilience but people will be left in the same vulnerable state they were when these bushfires hit.”, A spokesman for environment minister Sussan Ley responded that the government is “investing heavily in climate adaptation and mitigation” and claimed investment is growing., He cited a $23.9m commitment to the national environment sciences and climate change hub in science agency CSIRO, $37m for climate science monitoring and forecasting in CSIRO and $30m for the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence and Climate Extremes., Ebony Bennett, the Australia Institute deputy director, said the decision to cut the NCCARF’s adaptation funding was “shortsighted” and “typical of the Coalition approach to climate policy”., “Any economist will tell you an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure,” she said. “The government’s new embrace of adaptation and resilience is welcome, but it’s the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff approach., “To reduce the amount of gas and coal mined and burned in Australia is the better response … to prevent hotter and drier summers in future.”, Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said: “The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have cut funding for significant adaptation work at science agency CSIRO, completely de-funded the NCCARF and produced a national disaster risk reduction framework that failed to take climate change seriously., “The 2017 review of climate change policies completely excluded climate adaptation.”, Labor’s criticism comes as the government held roundtables in Canberra to discuss the response to the bushfire crisis at which Ley met wildlife experts and Andrews met scientific organisations., Suzanne Milthorpe, national environment laws campaigner at the Wilderness Society, said the wildlife roundtable had seen “strong recognition that we can’t go back to business as usual”., “Australia was already the extinction nation, the bushfire crisis has exacerbated that severely,” she said. “We need not just to return to pre-bushfire levels but to aim for health and resilience and against further shock., “This is an unprecedented catastrophe – the first at this scale – but it won’t be the last.”, Andrews said the science roundtable would discuss evidence about patterns of bushfire behaviour, contributors to the current fire season and tools to predict future seasons., Butler said the meeting was “a start” but Labor “won’t hold our breath waiting for real action on climate adaptation or action”., Earlier, Andrews told Nine Newspapers that “every second we spend discussing if climate change is real is a second we don’t spend addressing these issues”., Andrews issued a rebuke to many government MPs who continue to dispute the contribution of climate change to bushfires, such as George Christensen and Craig Kelly, warning it is time to “move on and get over this”., At a press conference in Canberra announcing extra bushfire payments to families, Morrison said the hazards of “longer, hotter, drier summers” had “always been acknowledged by the government”., Morrison said that adaptation measures including hazard reduction, building dams and learning from Indigenous burning practices are “a part of that important response”., “Our policy is to reduce emissions, to build resilience and to focus on adaptation,” he said. “All of these are the necessary responses to what’s happening with our climate. They are not either or, they are not one instead of the other.”coalitions axing of of funding to climate change adaptation body condemned", "label": 0}, "train-94": {"text": "Fast food giants still 'failing' on chicken welfare, says report, Pizza Hut, Burger King and Domino’s are among UK outlets rated ‘very poor’ in report from leading animal charity , Customers of some of the UK’s biggest fast-food chains including Pizza Hut and Burger King may be eating meat that comes from chickens reared in poor conditions, claims a new report from a leading animal charity., Amid growing concerns about the intensive and large-scale production of meat – with some birds growing so fast that they routinely suffer from lameness and skin lesions – World Animal Protection (WAP) has ranked eight of the leading brands according to their commitment, ambition and transparency to improve chicken welfare globally., In the UK it has been calling on Nando’s to urgently improve its chicken welfare policies, but the results of its analysis, published on Wednesday, reveal the chain has for the second consecutive year received a “poor” rating., The most improved is KFC, which has leaped from “poor” last year to “making progress”. In July it became the first UK fast food chain to sign up to the European Chicken Commitment – new welfare standards for farmed chickens that will improve the welfare of millions of birds in the UK, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden., For its report the charity analysed the policies of leading chains with retail operations in the UK; Burger King, Domino’s Pizza Group plc (covering Europe), KFC, McDonald’s, Nando’s, Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Subway. It also included Domino’s Pizza Inc which operates in the US and Canada., Burger King, Pizza Hut and Domino’s were all classed as having a “very poor” approach to managing chicken welfare. Only three of the chains assessed were classed as “getting started” or “making progress” on improving chicken welfare standards – KFC, Starbucks and Subway. Most companies are still failing to take chicken welfare seriously, the report said., Ian Woodhurst, WAP UK farming campaigns manager, said: “While it’s encouraging to see companies like KFC starting to take chicken welfare seriously, many people in the UK are expecting to see other companies, such as Nando’s, also do the right thing for chickens. These companies face a real reputational risk if they don’t take action now to move away from the use of fast-growing chickens that suffer from catastrophic health issues and live their short lives in unnecessary pain., “Consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about animal welfare and these iconic companies have the power to put an end to this suffering that they are causing for the sake of their own profits. We will continue to speak up for chickens and consumers to put pressure on companies to make real change.”, In the UK sales of red meat have fallen in recent years, but chicken – seen as a “healthy” meat – has seen sales rise. Fast-food chains are also increasingly launching “vegan-friendly”, plant-based versions of traditional meat patties., The charity is calling on the chains to take a lead on animal welfare and ensure that any chickens being served at their restaurants are reared in humane conditions., Nina Arnott, a spokesperson for Domino’s plc, said: “Domino’s Pizza Group is committed to ensuring high standards of animal welfare throughout our supply chain. We have strict welfare policies and regular checks to ensure our supply partners are 100% compliant. All our chickens are reared with natural daylight and enrichment, including perches and bales of straw. We do not have any battery cages in our supply chain. Domino’s has published a number of targets for 2020 to ensure we continue improving our welfare standards.”, A spokesperson for Subway said: “Subway takes animal welfare seriously by working closely with our suppliers to ensure that animals are treated well in accordance with Subway’s global animal welfare policy. All UK and Ireland chicken suppliers and their producers must, as a minimum, comply with EU animal welfare legislation and globally we support the principles of the Farm Animal Welfare Council Five Freedoms, which is a framework to safeguard and continually improve animal welfare., A spokesperson for Burger King said: “Responsible animal welfare is a top priority for Burger King UK and we work very closely with our suppliers to ensure that all animals reared for meat are well cared for and treated. We require our meat suppliers and their producers to support the principles of the globally recognised Farm Animal Welfare Council Five Freedoms.”, A spokesperson for McDonald’s said: “We are deeply committed to the health and welfare of all animals in our supply chain and know that our customers expect us to uphold high standards. Together with our suppliers, we work hard to focus on continuous improvement and have led the industry with positive moves on chicken welfare. For example, three years ago we made a progressive change to increase the daylight provision and enrichment for all birds in our supply chain for all chicken served in our UK and Irish restaurants, providing pecking objects and perches to encourage the birds to express their natural behaviours. These steps meet higher welfare scheme requirements and are ahead of many of our competitors., A spokesperson for Pizza Hut said: “We take animal welfare extremely seriously and have stringent policies in place to ensure all our suppliers adhere to the highest standards. We are also taking steps to ensure we continue to progress in this area – we support the European Chicken Commitment and as such we will expect our suppliers to meet a series of set requirements for all of the chicken in our supply chain by 2026. In addition to this, all our eggs are now free range, which is something we worked to achieve a year ahead of our target.”, KFC said: “We know our customers care deeply about chicken welfare standards and our business depends on it. We were proud to be one of the first restaurant brands to sign up to the Better Chicken Commitment but we won’t stop there. This is just the beginning and we hope others take confidence from our commitment and join the growing movement to create real change to improve the lives of chickens.”, Nando’s said: “We take animal welfare very seriously, knowing it’s as important to our customers as it is to us. We know that as a recognisable chicken restaurant group we have a responsibility to ensure that every aspect of how we source our chicken is done in the best possible way. We welcome initiatives like the Better Chicken Commitment and share the aspiration and recognition of the need to change, which we believe needs to be a combined effort across the industry. We look forward to keeping everyone updated on our plans as we move forward on this important issue.”, Domino’s Inc and Starbucks have been approached for comment.fast food giants still failing on chicken welfare says report", "label": 0}, "train-95": {"text": "\nClimate emergency: 2019 was second hottest year on record\n, Last decade was also hottest yet in 150 years of measurements, say scientists, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nWed 15 Jan 2020 11.09 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Jan 2020 03.29 EST\n\n, The year 2019 was the second hottest on record for the planet’s surface, according to latest research. The analyses reveal the scale of the climate crisis: both the past five years and the past decade are the hottest in 150 years., The succession of records being broken year after year is “the drumbeat of the Anthropocene”, said one scientist, and is bringing increasingly severe storms, floods, droughts and wildfires., The previous hottest year was in 2016, the year that a natural El Niño event boosted temperatures. The new data is for the average global surface air temperature. More than 90% of the heat trapped by human greenhouse gas emissions is absorbed by the oceans, but on Monday scientists revealed 2019 as the warmest yet recorded in the seas, calling it “dire news”., The average temperature in 2019 was about 1.1C above the average from 1850-1900, before large-scale fossil fuel burning began. The world’s scientists have warned that global heating beyond 1.5C will significantly worsen extreme weather and suffering for hundreds of millions of people., The World Economic Forum’s global risk assessment for the next decade, also published on Wednesday, found the top five dangers were all environmental, including extreme weather, failure to prepare for climate change and the destruction of the natural world., “The last decade was easily the warmest decade in the record and is the first decade more than 1C above late 19th-century temperatures,” said Gavin Schmidt, of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which produced one of the temperature records., “What is important is the totality of evidence from multiple independent data sets that the Earth is warming, that human activity is driving it and the impacts are clearly being felt,” he said. “These announcements might sound like a broken record, but what is being heard is the drumbeat of the Anthropocene.”, “It’s now official that we have just completed the warmest decade on record, a reminder that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels,” said Prof Michael Mann at Penn State University in the US., While instrumental temperature records stretch back to 1850, data from ice cores indicate that today’s temperatures were last seen at least 100,000 years ago. Furthermore, the level of carbon dioxide is the highest it has been for several million years, when the sea level was 15-20 metres higher., The four temperature datasets are compiled from many millions of surface temperature measurements taken across the globe, from all continents and all oceans. They are produced by the UK Met Office with the University of East Anglia (UEA), both Nasa and Noaa in the US, and Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Small differences between the analyses arise from how data-sparse polar regions are treated, but all agree that the past five years are the warmest five years since each global record began., The Met Office’s forecast for global average temperature for 2020 suggests this year could well set another record and is very likely to be among the top three hottest. The UK government will host a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow in November. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, and many others are urging nations to increase dramatically their pledges to cut carbon emissions, which would  lead to global temperatures rising by a disastrous 3-4C., “It is obvious we are not succeeding in preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, which was the main goal of the original 1992 UN climate change convention,” said Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics., “Even if we succeed in limiting warming to 1.5C, this would not be a ‘safe’ level of warming for the world,” he said. “Therefore we must focus on cutting global emissions to net zero as soon as possible. We know the transition to a net zero economy is the growth story of the 21st century.”, Rosie Rogers, of Greenpeace UK, said: “We’re breaking more records than Usain Bolt, but there are no gold medals for dangerous temperature rises, or the floods and fires that come with it. We cannot run away from the climate emergency.”climate emergency 2019 was second hottest year on record", "label": 0}, "train-96": {"text": "\nActivists cheer BlackRock's landmark climate move but call for vigilance\n, Divestment decision by the world’s biggest fund manager called a breakthrough – but only a first step, \nEdward Helmore in New York, \n\nWed 15 Jan 2020 03.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Jan 2020 10.28 EST\n\n, In recent decades, environmentalists have grown used to disappointment when big companies and Wall Street pay lip service to concern over the climate crisis. On Tuesday, it looked like something might have changed., The decision by BlackRock – the world’s biggest asset manager – to exit investments that “present a high sustainability-related risk” has been welcomed by environmentalists as a significant moment in the battle to reshape the relationship between money and the climate crisis., The move is “a remarkable breakthrough”, the leading climate science writer Bill McKibben told the Guardian. “The activists who made this happen get the afternoon off to celebrate., “This is the biggest pot of money in the world and until today, its leaders have refused to acknowledge the biggest thing happening on the planet – the accelerating rise in temperature. So it indicates that the facts on the ground of the climate crisis are so grave that no one can turn away, and that activist pressure has reached a point that even the richest companies are not immune.”, In two letters on Monday, the BlackRock boss, Larry Fink, announced: “The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance” and henceforth the company would divest $500m from coal-related businesses., The announcement called on “every company, not just energy firms, to rethink their carbon footprints”., BlackRock, which holds $7tn in assets, has come under intense pressure to reform the funds it offers investors., “Awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,” Fink wrote, adding that new funds would allow clients to avoid investments in companies that may be adding to climate change., The firm said it doubled to 150 the number of exchange-traded funds it offers that address social, environmental or governance issues., In November, climate activists protested outside BlackRock’s London offices, dumping ashes to signify the Amazon fires while Extinction Rebellion, the global environmental movement, described BlackRock as the world’s top investor in deforestation and coal. Fink himself has received letters from members of Congress urging action, while BlackRock was named as an investor with one of the worst voting records on climate issues by Ceres, a not-for-profit watchdog that pushes financial firms to consider sustainability., The pressure for change has come from within the world of finance as well as outside. Last month, Mark Carney, the outgoing head of the Bank of England, warned that pension funds risk seeing their assets become worthless unless companies rapidly rise to the challenge of the climate crisis., But while some celebrated, others warned that sustainable investing will not be quick or simple for BlackRock. It currently holds a 6.7% stake in ExxonMobil, 6.9% in Chevron, and 6% in the mining company Glencore. Two-thirds of its $7tn in assets are in tracking funds that cannot easily be switched to meet sustainability goals., McKibben, who last year published a devastating report in the New Yorker titled Money Is the Oxygen on Which the Fire of Global Warming Burns and who is part of a campaign to force companies including Goldman Sachs, Chase Bank and BlackRock to reform their investments, said environmentalists would now need to keep the pressure up., “The steps BlackRock is taking are baby steps, and we will have to watch and push hard for them to begin striding at the pace we need to go. But in some sense, the first step is often the hardest,” McKibben said., He urged the company to go further. Its decision to divest $500m from coal-related businesses, for instance, is not the same as divesting from larger and far more polluting oil and gas industries., “Coal is part of the problem, but not the biggest part of the problem – oil and gas are,” McKibben said. “Fink made noises that natural gas is part of the solution but it’s not. That’s old thinking, and we’ll push them hard on that, but at least we’ve reached the point that they’ve realized they have a role in dealing with the climate crisis.”, But perhaps the largest change is BlackRock’s apparent willingness to use its considerable shareholder power to demand climate action – a power it has in the past demurred from using in favor of direct company consultations., A report last year by the Washington DC-based Majority Action and the Climate Majority Project claimed that BlackRock had voted overwhelmingly against key climate resolutions at energy companies, including ExxonMobil., Had BlackRock and Vanguard not torpedoed these investor efforts, at least 16 climate-critical shareholder resolutions at S&amp;P 500 companies would have received majority support in 2019, representing a significant corporate shift on climate, the report claimed., “We have the largest investment stewardship team in the industry and engage with companies even in the absence of shareholder proposals,” BlackRock said in a statement to the Guardian at the time. But, it warned, “it would be wrong to equate good governance with voting against management without regard for a proposal’s impact”., In Tuesday’s statement, that position appeared to be shifting from last year when it said that “recent extreme weather events” and “the implications for investment portfolios – stemming from a rising frequency and intensity of such events – have been notoriously hard for investors to grasp”., No longer. Now BlackRock’s CEO writes that company directors should be held accountable “where we feel companies and boards are not producing effective sustainability disclosures or implementing frameworks for managing these issues”. He added that “the company voted against or withheld votes from 4,800 directors at 2,700 different companies” last year., There are still worries for environmentalists. Majority Action’s Eli Kasargod-Staub warned that subtlety in BlackRock’s language calling for companies to improve disclosure on “integrating and reporting on sustainability” is not the same as calling for immediate action., “BlackRock has the power to be going to corporate directors and saying: ‘Either you commit to the science-based targets of the Paris climate agreement and align your operations, governance, political spending, lobby and trade association activities to achieve that target or we will vote against you and your directors,’” Kasargod-Staub said., “But that’s not what BlackRock said – they said they’re calling on companies to enhance their disclosures around climate risks and their plans around those risks,” he added., Kasargod-Staub pointed to this quote from BlackRock, directed at companies it invests in: “This should include your plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures guidelines.”, “Think about how passive that sentence is, then think about the behavior of ExxonMobil or Marathon petroleum, who through their capital expenditures and policy influence have actively undermined our ability to protect long-term investors and meet the goals of the Paris agreement,” said Kasargod-Staub., Whether Blackrock is now going to side with activist resolutions on sustainability remains to be seen during shareholder season, McKibben said, but he warned against expecting a shift by fossil-fuel energy producers to become carbon-neutral., “I don’t think the big oil companies are capable of changing, though I’d like to be proved wrong,” he said. “The job is basically to starve them and reduce their ability to continue expanding.”, Still, McKibben said: “For all of us that have been campaigning for years around climate finances, this is an historic moment. From today, it’s going to be harder to go sink of load of money in Exxon, because the biggest financial firm in the world has said, ‘Huh, there’s something to this climate stuff.

This makes sense. After all, consumers have long been advised by detergent manufacturers and environmental organisations to turn down the dial on the washing machine to 30C. Dropping to 25C is a small adjustment, but possibly a greater psychological one: will clothes really be clean at that temperature, and on such a short cycle?, Lucy Cotton, the report’s lead author, said that the temperature of the water used in the test machines, which were set on a “cold” cycle, was 25C. Her research tested the release of dye and of microfibres from a range of consumer clothing, such as Fruit of the Loom T-shirts. However, the clothes were not dirty when they went into the wash, and only the release of microfibres and desorption of dye were measured. “We weren’t testing for cleanliness,” she says. “One of the things that is useful about this study is that it puts the onus on detergent manufacturers to explore this area. Can they make the cleanliness happen in a cold, quick wash?”, Wrap, the waste reduction charity that has a campaign called Love Your Clothes, considers 30C to be a cold wash – even though, in 2013, the EU’s Ecodesign initiative made an even lower 20C setting compulsory on new washing machine models, and 30C is not cold (my local outdoor lido is heated to 25C). But according to the Energy Savings Trust, washing clothing at 20C instead of 40C saves about 66% of the energy used for a load (compared to a 40% saving for dropping to 30C)., Proctor &amp; Gamble tested its Ariel Gel for effectiveness and stain removal at 20C, while Which? magazine found in a test that an olive oil stain was the only one a 20C wash couldn’t shift compared with a 40C wash. It’s got to be worth a try. But just remember to keep the cycle length short, and avoid a delicates wash because these use more water than average cycles and cause more microfibres to shed., This article was amended on 15 January 2020 because an earlier version wrongly referred to 25C as being the “inlet” temperature of water in a washing machine. That meant to refer 25C being the temperature of the water used in the machines set on a “cold” cycle in the research.

The new government has championed its commitment to climate action. It now needs to set out its policy on fossil fuel extraction, making clear that digging more coal out of the ground is no longer acceptable,” Willis said., Recommendations made in the report include using less steel, using recycled steel, improving the efficiency of steel production with conventional blast furnaces, and producing steel with new processes such as renewable energy., Dustin Benton, Green Alliance’s policy director, said: “Clean energy has already made coal obsolete in the power sector. Our previous work shows that UK demand for coking coal would halve if steel producers opted for cheaper, cleaner steel production using today’s technologies., “In addition, innovation in zero carbon steel production means this mine will likely become redundant in the near future, saddling Cumbria with an expensive stranded asset.”, Councillors who backed proposals for the undersea mine said it would create vital jobs. It is expected to employ 500 people, with an estimated 2,000 more jobs created in its supply chain., But Berners-Lee, a leading expert in carbon footprinting and the brother of internet pioneer Sir Tim, said the emphasis should be on creating green jobs., “Cumbria’s politicians understandably want to see new jobs on the west coast. But we estimate that the profits from the mine would leave the local area, with only 3% of the turnover spent on salaries,” he said., “We urgently need an active, low-carbon industrial strategy for Cumbria and other local areas, to generate thousands of green jobs rather than hundreds of coal jobs.”, The developer West Cumbria Mining has previously revealed that it agreed a deal for a 50MW solar farm nearby to provide about a third of the project’s energy needs, in order to mitigate some of the impact of the plant on the environment., In June, the UK became the first large economy to pass laws to end its contribution to global warming by 2050. The goal requires Britain to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, compared with the previous target of at least 80% reduction from 1990 levels., A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We are well on the way to phasing coal out of our energy system by 2025 and last year Great Britain went nearly 4,000 hours without using coal for electricity. Ending our use of it will be a key milestone on our journey to end our contribution to climate change entirely., “Although coal will soon no longer be part of our energy system, there will continue to be domestic demand for coal in industries such as steel, cement and even heritage railways.” , West Cumbria Mining said it did not want to comment on the report.new cumbria coalmine incompatible with climate crisis goals", "label": 0}, "train-99": {"text": "\nWarming oceans force leatherback turtles on longer journeys to feed\n, Migration routes after nesting in French Guiana found extended as far as Nova Scotia and France, research shows , \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nTue 14 Jan 2020 19.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 15 Jan 2020 08.34 EST\n\n, Leatherback turtles are making exhausting journeys, in some cases nearly twice as long as usual, from nesting to feeding grounds, because of rising ocean temperatures and changing sea currents., After nesting, turtles must move to cooler waters to feed, but higher temperatures mean some are having to swim further to reach suitable areas, according to research from Greenpeace and the French Institut Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, part of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique., The researchers tagged 10 nesting female leatherback turtles last year on the Yalimapo and Remire-Montjoly beaches of French Guiana, and then tracked their migration through the north Atlantic. Some of the turtles were found to have swum as far as Nova Scotia in north-east Canada and to France to find new feeding grounds for the jellyfish which form their main diet., Though small in scale, the research provides an insight into how some marine species are being forced to adapt to the warming oceans. This week scientists warned that ocean temperatures had reached record levels with the last five years, which were the five hottest on record., Warming oceans pose clear dangers to human life as they lead to more intense storms and rising sea levels, but the impact of the increasing frequency of heatwaves at sea on marine species is much less studied. There is evidence that some species, including commercially important fish such as cod, are migrating towards the poles in search of cooler waters, but more research is needed for a fuller picture., In another stark example of the dangers to marine life from human actions, one turtle followed was found dead on a beach in Suriname only 120km (74 miles) from the starting point, drowned after having become enmeshed in a discarded fishing net. , Estimates say more than half of all sea turtles have ingested plastic. The animals also face threats from overfishing, though they are mainly bycatch rather than targets., The beaches of French Guiana were once abundant turtle nesting grounds, but now the eggs laid there are only a small fraction of those laid 30 years ago., Last year, the complete absence of leatherback turtles from a beach in a nature reserve in Nicaragua also raised alarm., “Sea turtles survived the extinction of the dinosaurs, but they might not survive us,” said Will McCallum, a campaigner at Greenpeace. “Human activity has put such severe pressure on sea turtle populations around the world that six out of the seven species are threatened with extinction.

In Prince William Sound in southern Alaska, more than 4,500 bird carcasses were found every kilometer, or 0.62 miles., The blob stems from a years-long severe marine heatwave, believed to be caused by an anticyclone weather system that first appeared in 2013. The weather phenomenon known as El Niño accelerated the warming temperatures beginning in 2015 and, by 2016, the rising heat resulted in water temperatures nearly 11F (6C) above average., Anticyclones form when a mass of air cools, contracts and becomes more dense, increasing the weight of the atmosphere and the surface air pressure., Heat maps at the time showed a huge red blob growing, spanning more than 380,000 sq miles (1m sq km). That’s nearly 1.5 times the size of Texas or four times the size of New Zealand., The study found that the murres mostly likely starved to death. The seabird must eat half its body weight to survive, but food grew scarce amid intense competition from other creatures. Warming ocean waters gave fish such as salmon and halibut a metabolism boost, causing a fight for survival over the limited supply of smaller fish., Researchers also uncovered other effects, including a vast bloom of harmful algae along the US west coast that cost fisheries millions of dollars in revenue. Other animals also died off, including sea lions, tufted puffins and baleen whales., “Think of it as a run on the grocery stores at the same time that the delivery trucks to the stores stopped coming so often,” Julia Parrish, a co-author of the study and UW professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, said in a press release., The murres’ population also took a hit. According to the study, a limited food supply resulted in reduced breeding colonies across the entire region. Between the 2015 and 2016 breeding seasons, more than 15 colonies did not produce a single chick. Researchers say those estimates could be low since they only monitor a quarter of all colonies., The seabird has not replenished in numbers after the mass die-off., “The magnitude and scale of this failure has no precedent,” said John Piatt, the lead researcher. “It was astonishing and alarming, and a red-flag warning about the tremendous impact sustained ocean warming can have on the marine ecosystem.”, Researchers cannot determine how long it will take for the population to rebound – or if it ever will., “In light of predicted global warming trends and the associated likelihood of more frequent heatwaves”, the study concluded, this could be a stark warning about the impending effects of the climate crisis., Meanwhile, another huge heat blob has formed off the Washington coast and up into the Gulf of Alaska, and is growing., This article was amended on 16 January 2020.

Green businesses fared little better, seeing their numbers drop from an estimated 93,500 to 88,500 over the same four-year period., The ONS said there was a small increase in the number of people employed in the green economy between 2016 and 2018, but this was not enough to offset a huge drop in the number of jobs and businesses between 2014 and 2016., Critics of the Conservative government’s record of support for the low carbon and renewables sector blamed the Treasury’s dramatic cut in subsidies to the solar power industry for the sudden loss of employment., Solar panel installers were among the many businesses connected to the industry that went bust after the Treasury cut subsidy payments by 65% in 2015 before abolishing them altogether last year., Of the UK’s four countries, England saw the biggest fall in the number of green jobs followed by Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales was the only area to see an increase – from 10,000 to 11,400 jobs., Adding to the downbeat analysis, the ONS said the recent increase in activity was also mainly due to acquisitions in the renewable sector rather than an increase in investment., A report by the Committee on Climate Change, an independent government advisory body, found that UK emissions met the government’s 2018 target, following a decline in emissions to 44% below 1990 levels. But a recent slowdown meant it was “not on track” to meet the next target, which covers the period 2023-27, or to reduce emissions by at least 100% of 1990 levels by 2050., The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial strategy said the figures for 2014 were distorted by a change in the way the ONS estimated employment and that since 2015 the number of green jobs had risen from 200,000 by more than 24,000., Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said: “A greener economy creates enormous opportunities for new employment, with the low-carbon sector potentially supporting 2m green-collar jobs by 2030., “As we seek to end our contribution to climate change entirely by 2050, I am determined that these numbers will increase even further in the years ahead.”, TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said recent progress was “still far too slow” and meant the government had a “dreadful record”., The Royal Society of Arts and Manufacturing said the figures “should be a wake-up call for ministers” who have pledged to cut greenhouse emissions to net zero by 2050. The thinktank’s director of economics, Asheem Singh, said: “It is pretty clear that the UK is well behind in meeting its next milestones and the 2050 target., “Reaching the target is inextricably linked to the growth of the green economy and it is clear from these figures that this just isn’t happening.”, Britain’s renewable energy industry has expanded in the last three years, mainly in response to the growth of offshore windfarms. The share of total electricity generation from renewables reached 38.9% in September, the highest recorded and higher than gas generation for the first time., But the industry employs relatively few workers in service companies while most turbines are manufactured abroad, limiting the scope for a dramatic rise in the number of people employed across the industry., The ONS figures showed that £6.3bn worth of imports of renewables and low carbon services exceeded the value of exports by £1.2bn, leaving the UK with a 20% deficit in the balance of green trade., Caterina Brandmayr, senior policy analyst at Green Alliance said the figures “expose the yawning gap between the UK’s net zero law and policy in most government departments to drive decarbonisation”., She said most efforts to cut carbon had focused on the offshore wind sector, “but other sectors have huge untapped potential to decarbonise”., She added: “Efforts to cut carbon emissions from transport and buildings have been woefully unambitious. Transport emissions have flatlined since 1990 and buildings energy efficiency policy has been stalled for years. And there is very little policy at all to improve industry’s resource efficiency.”, The Treasury is expected to put forward several measures to encourage investment in industries that promise to reduce carbon emissions, but investments are likely to take several years to bear fruit.uk green economy has shrunk since 2014", "label": 0}, "train-103": {"text": "\nThe war on plastic won’t be easily won\n, David Fell on the difficulty of containing consumption, Libby Peake on the conclusions of the Green Alliance’s report, Haddon Willmer on the NHS’s extensive use of single-use plastic, Wiebina Heesterman on The Clean Kilo shops, and Jose Roberto Senna on local governments subsidising waste, Letters, \n\nThu 16 Jan 2020 12.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Jan 2020 18.08 EST\n\n, I am delighted to see John Vidal explaining that there’s no way of making current levels of consumption “environmentally friendly” (The solution to the plastic waste crisis? It’s not recycling, Journal, 15 January). But I am alarmed when he says: “Can consumption ever be contained? Easily.” It will not be easy., It is simply wishful thinking to say that “we can learn to just say no to buying ever more new stuff”. We are comprehensively addicted to our consumerist lifestyles; the western economic model is fundamentally predicated on consumerism; and, while the machinery of power will tolerate the sorts of marginal changes mentioned by Vidal, it will fiercely resist anything on the scale required if we are to seriously address our social and environmental crises., I suggested in my 2016 book Bad Habits, Hard Choices that a possible solution is what I called SmartVAT. Using the obesity crisis as an example, I propose that we should increase the price of harmful products by using a higher rate of VAT, and decrease the price of helpful or “good” products through negative VAT. I present evidence that, suitably designed and presented, this approach would be considered fair by the British public, and could be fiscally neutral to the exchequer. In his 2017 book Heat, Greed and Human Need, Prof Ian Gough suggests that SmartVAT could provide an important transitional process towards a more sustainable economy., In the end, a sustainable economy will come into being if we, as consumers, demand it. But we will need help to get there. “Just say no” is not, and never has been, enough.David FellLondon, • John Vidal is right to say there is no way of making our current levels of consumption environmentally friendly. However, our report is not simply promoting recycling and an end to consumer confusion., While recycling will certainly form part of a sustainable system, it wasn’t the main focus of this research. Instead, we show that companies in the grocery sector – under pressure from the public and in the absence of government leadership – run the risk of simply replacing plastic with other single-use materials. We call for solutions that “address the systemic problems of our throwaway society, to avoid the risk of simply substituting current environmental problems with new ones”., Vidal argues for more reuse. The final sections of our report outline how such systems are making inroads and companies are considering how to incorporate more refill models into their operations. This is cause for hope in the battle against throwaway living. Single-use culture is now such a part of everyday life that it will take a huge joint effort to break it, from government, producers, retailers, recyclers, the media and consumers., We believe that the first step should be to consider all materials we use, not just plastic.Libby PeakeGreen Alliance, • I am just home from two days’ emergency care in the NHS, full of gratitude and admiration for people working there. But it seems modern medicine is built on single-use plastic. What is the cost, in money and to the environment, of the production and disposal of it all? It is clearly taken for granted, as workers and patients ask no questions about it. Do we all assume there is no alternative? Yet John Vidal says, rightly, that we must stop building these mountains. Haddon WillmerLeeds, • Here in Birmingham we now have two The Clean Kilo shops where you go with your own containers and/or bags, weigh these empty, then fill and weigh them. The shops have a large range of dry goods, cleaning materials, herbs and spices, a selection of sweets, savoury products and locally grown vegetables. The friendly staff stand ready to help people if necessary. Most of the products sold are organic. Their motto is “refuse, reduce, reuse”, with recycle as an inferior option. We need more The Clean Kilo shops and plastic-free aisles in supermarkets.

The amount of waste your household produces does not make a difference in your taxes. People who produce less waste are paying for the more wasteful households.

As everybody keeps saying, it’s unprecedented,” he said., The Blue Mountains world heritage area covers one million hectares of national park and bushland and is dominated by temperate eucalypt forest., The area is renowned for the diversity of its vegetation and is home to about a third of the world’s eucalypt species., While most are fire-adapted and can regenerate, many of the species depend on long intervals between fires, Merson said., “We had a very large fire in 2013. It’s only six years after that,” he said., “The eucalypts can be very badly reduced in diversity if fires come through in too short and intense intervals. Their numbers will virtually collapse.”, He said the full impact on tree species and wildlife would not be known until more assessments were done as fire grounds became accessible., But there are concerns about the effect on breeding and feeding habitats for species including the spotted-tail quoll and the brush-tailed rock-wallaby., The fires have also burnt swamp communities that release water slowly and are important water resources. They flow into streams that feed into Sydney’s water supply and provide water for wildlife., It was revealed this week that a rescue mission by NSW fire crews was able to save the only known natural grove of Wollemi pines, so-called “dinosaur trees” that fossil records show existed up to 200m years ago., Merson said the fires had entered areas that had not burnt previously and the need for the rescue mission was indicative of the intensity of the fires in the region., “This is climate change in its most fundamental form,” he said., “This is right in our face. We’re living it.”, Further north, the fires have devastated parts of the Gondwana rainforest world heritage area, a collection of reserves of subtropical rainforest that span 366,500 hectares across NSW and Queensland., Guardian Australia used newly released data which combines all burned areas in NSW and Queensland since 1 July 2019, and calculated the area of overlap with world heritage areas., This analysis shows 53% of the Gondwana rainforest area has burned., Guardian Australia spoke to Mark Graham, an ecologist with the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, in December., Graham is based in the Bellinger Valley near some of these fires., He said since December there had been “significant, additional fire in areas that hadn’t burned” in Barrington Tops, and that most of the Gondwana areas have taken a “massive hit”., “It’s heart-wrenching. It’s disturbing. It’s frightening.”, Graham said his area had experienced some rain in recent weeks but there were now concerns that sediment washed into the Bellinger River has affected the food sources for the critically endangered Bellinger River snapping turtle., A spokesman for the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment said understanding the impact of the fires on both world heritage areas was a priority., “Analysis will improve as the forests becomes safe to enter and the smoke clears, enabling accurate satellite and aerial imagery to help guide our assessment and on work on ground,” he said., He said both regions contained a mixture of forest types, some of which was adapted for fire, but others that were more sensitive to fire, such as dense rainforest., Jess Abrahams, the nature campaigner for the Australian Conservation Foundation, said climate change was hitting Australia’s world heritage areas “very hard”., “We have witnessed consecutive years of devastating coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, while global heating has been described as a catastrophic risk to the Wet Tropics and Shark Bay world heritage areas,” he said., “It’s really upsetting to see how much of the Blue Mountains world heritage area has been burnt., “This is a place many Australians know and love.

It implied a constitutional right to a stable climate, and alleged that the government violated the public trust by failing to protect assets held in trust, notably the atmosphere., The plaintiffs, now all between the ages of 12 and 23, also asked the US district court of Oregon to order the government to craft a climate remediation plan, one targeting scientifically acceptable standards to stabilize the climate., On Friday, the ninth circuit court found, however, that the court lacked the power to enforce such a plan or climate policy decisions by the government and Congress, concluding “in the end, any plan is only as good as the court’s power to enforce it”., Nevertheless, the court found that the record “conclusively establishes that the federal government has long understood the risks of fossil fuel use and increasing carbon dioxide emissions” and “that the government’s contribution to climate change is not simply a result of inaction”., The court also found that the youth met the requirements for standing in the case and that some of the plaintiffs met the requirements for actual injury., Levi Draheim, a 12-year-old plaintiff from Satellite Beach, Florida, the court found was injured by repeat evacuations from his home during worsening storms. Jaime Butler, 19, was injured by displacement from her home because of water security issues, separating her from relatives in the Navajo Nation, the court also found. The court also found that the plaintiffs proved their injuries were caused by the climate crisis., Two of the three judges balked at the scope of change required to reverse climate breakdown, finding that halting certain programs would not halt the growth of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere or injuries to the plaintiffs., “Indeed, the plaintiffs’ experts make plain that reducing the global consequences of climate change demands much more than cessation of the government’s promotion of fossil fuels. Rather, these experts opine that such a result calls for no less than a fundamental transformation of this country’s energy system, if not that of the industrialized world … given the complexity and long-lasting nature of global climate change, the court would be required to supervise the government’s compliance with any suggested plan for many decades.”, Kelsey Juliana, the 23-year-old named plaintiff in Juliana v United States and a resident of Eugene, Oregon, said she was “disappointed that these judges would find that federal courts can’t protect America’s youth, even when a constitutional right has been violated”., “Such a holding is contrary to American principles of justice that I have been taught since elementary school,” Juliana added. “This decision gives full, unfettered authority to the legislative and executive branches of government to destroy our country, because we are dealing with a crisis that puts the very existence of our nation in peril.”, “We will continue this case because only the courts can help us,” Draheim told the Guardian following the ruling. “We brought this lawsuit to secure our liberties and protect our lives and our homes. Much like the civil rights cases, we firmly believe the courts can vindicate our constitutional rights and we will not stop until we get a decision that says so.”, District Judge Josephine L Staton, in a lengthy dissenting opinion, argued that courts do have the authority to protect the young in the face of climate breakdown, and should, given the government’s inaction: “In these proceedings, the government accepts as fact that the United States has reached a tipping point crying out for a concerted response – yet presses ahead toward calamity. It is as if an asteroid were barreling toward Earth and the government decided to shut down our only defenses. Seeking to quash this suit, the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the nation.”, The court ordered the case be remanded to the district court and dismissed.climate change lawsuit activists lose appeal sue us ", "label": 0}, "train-107": {"text": "\nThe week in wildlife - in pictures\n, The week in wildlife - in pictures, The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, including an iguana and an injured leopard, \nEric Hilaire, \n\nFri 17 Jan 2020 15.26 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 17 Jan 2020 18.08 EST\n\n, Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian, Photograph: Martin Meissner/AP, Photograph: Galapagos national park/AP, Photograph: Chris Bruetsch/AP, Photograph: Jerome Murray/Alamy, Photograph: Dmitry Feoktistov/Tass/Getty Images, Photograph: Hotli Simanjuntak/EPA, Photograph: Ye Aung Thu/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters, Photograph: Jo-Anne McArthur/Weanimals, Photograph: HO/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: BOYHAQI/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Anupam Nath/AP, Photograph: Loïc Venance/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Oksana Maksymova/Alamy, Photograph: New Zealand Ministry For Primary Industries/AAP, Photograph: Deepak Sharma/AP, Photograph: HO/SERFOR/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Friends of Big Bear Valley/AP, Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Michael Couffer/APthe week in wildlife in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-108": {"text": "Small steps towards a plastic-free world, Re John Vidal’s article (The solution to the plastic waste crisis?

This was eye-opening, as my family discovered that all the apples (and most of the other loose fruit) in our supermarkets had plastic stickers on every piece of fruit. Milk bottles were out (plant milk cartons have plastic tops); as was bread, salt, pasta, cereal (plastic inners) and tofu (entirely encased in plastic). On our second trip out we finally hunted down non-plastic-wrapped yeast to make our own bread. It opened our eyes to what a mountain of plastic we normally cart home in our eco-friendly cloth bags., This inspired some changes around the house, which has reduced our consumption dramatically. It has had the added benefit of our food being healthier and cheaper. We now shop at Unboxed, a local store selling most essentials – including herbs and spices – without packaging. We make our own plant milk in the blender and bread in the bread maker (this all takes an average of 15 minutes every evening), and tofu with soy beans grown by a local farmer. We now stop before buying anything, and consider the packaging options., The shift hasn’t been easy, but it hasn’t been impossible.

This abuse amounts to an admission that the police do not know how to deal with XR. They are familiar with capturing those who avoid arrest. But many in XR welcome arrest as a way of highlighting the climate emergency., I was arrested during the October rebellion last year. As I was leaving Wood Green station, I overheard two police officers talking. One said to the other: “There must be a better way. They are doing this because they believe in it, and we are doing this because it’s our job. There must be a better way.” He was right. A better way is needed – and not one that involves further abuse of police powers. That better way requires the government to listen to XR, and to act on the climate crisis.

More surprising still is that the bird has lived for four months almost completely unnoticed by the public close to the M40 and the commuter belt., The eagle, known as G3-93, is one of six satellite-tracked specimens released on to the Isle of Wight last summer, when they became England’s first resident sea eagles, or white-tailed eagles, for 250 years., “He thinks he’s a red kite,” said Steve Egerton-Read, a project officer for the reintroduction programme led by Forestry England and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation. “Like all young birds, he tries to learn from other birds. In the absence of other eagles, he’s learning from red kites. He flies around picking up bits of dead stuff – dead rabbits, dead game birds.”, Scavenging carrion is normal for young sea eagles, which rarely learn to hunt live animals in their first year. According to Egerton-Read, G3-93 is living on private land where the bird is safe from persecution by humans., “Oxfordshire is full of game shoots but there’s no ill-will towards it and the landowners are very pleased to have another exciting bird to add to their list,” he said. “I don’t have many concerns for their safety over southern England and there is much more food for them here than in Scotland.”, In six months since the six eagles’ reintroduction into England, their tags have revealed their contrasting fates. One bird died shortly after release during a prolonged wet spell. It has not yet had a postmortem to reveal its cause of death., Another, named Culver, was tracked cruising over central London on a day-trip from the Isle of Wight. Unfortunately its tag failed and the bird is feared dead because it has not been spotted since., Barely one in three young eagles survive to adulthood so to have four of six surviving into 2020 was a very positive start, Egerton-Read said., Previous attempts to reintroduce sea eagles have been scuppered by fears they would terrorise pigs and lambs, but the current specimens appear to have melted into busy southern England. There have been relatively few reliable public sightings, although there was one unconfirmed report that an eagle devouring roadkill was narrowly missed by a lorry., Three of the eagles remain on the Isle of Wight. G3-18, a female, returns every day to a feeding station to take the fish Egerton-Read puts out., Another female, G3-24, and a male, G2-74, are living in the same woodland, leading to hopes that they may eventually form a mating pair., White-tailed eagles take five years to reach maturity, and even then may not breed successfully for another two or three years., The project aims to release as many as 60 eagles in southern England over the next four years. The birds are taken as chicks from nests in Scotland, where there are now 150 pairs after the birds were reintroduced from Norway in the 1970s., It took 30 years for the first chick to fledge in Scotland but Egerton-Read hopes the English reintroduction will be quicker. “If we’re lucky, by 2030 we might get eight to 10 breeding pairs,” he said., Egerton-Read said the project would inform the public if the English eagles began appearing regularly at accessible sites so they could be watched and admired. They may become more visible in the summer when they become more active, soaring on thermals., “I remember 20 years ago buzzards were a rare sight in this part of the world,” he said. “I’m really looking forward to the day people look up and go, ‘Oh, another eagle.’ That will be a success.”young sea eagle takes up residence among oxfordshires red kites", "label": 0}, "train-111": {"text": "\nActivists warn of ‘fracking by stealth’ and call for acid fracking ban\n, Fears grow companies may use it to get around temporary fracking moratorium, \nJessica Murray, \n\nFri 17 Jan 2020 01.09 EST\n\n, Campaigners have warned that the fracking moratorium announced by the UK government does not apply to acid fracking, a process that involves injecting acid into the earth to dissolve and fracture rock., More than 500 academics, politicians and campaigners have signed an open letter initiated by Brockham Oil Watch calling on the government to ban the practice over fears companies may use it to get around the moratorium., Lawyers and academics said regulation of the use of acid in oil and gas wells is vague and could be exploited., Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, is one of the letter’s signatories. “It isn’t acceptable just to have half a moratorium. The definition of fracking needs to be expanded, regulations need to apply right across all forms of unconventional drilling, and local communities need to know what’s going on beneath their feet.”, No permits have yet been granted for acid stimulation in England, although oil and gas companies, along with water companies, commonly use acid wash to clean wells., Campaigners fear the lack of monitoring of acid use could lead to “fracking by stealth” through matrix acidising, where liquid is injected into the earth at low pressure to dissolve rock, or acid fracturing or fracking, where the acid is used at high pressure to fracture the rock., Residents in Wressle, north Lincolnshire are waiting on the outcome of a public inquiry which took place in November last year to decide whether onshore oil and gas company Egdon can continue drilling at its site in the area. The company’s plans involve using an “proppant squeeze” that would dissolve rock around the well and can create small fractures., The newly elected Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole, Andrew Percy has previously described fracking as “industrialisation of the countryside” and said affected communities should be given more power over the issue – although he had previously voted against tighter fracking regulation., Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, said the UK government’s definition of fracking is part of the problem., “Most countries define fracking as the intention to fracture the rock, but the UK takes the use of quite a large volume of fluid as the definition of fracking,” he said. “It’s quite possible to use a small volume of fluid to frack the rock, including acid, without actually naming it as fracking and without going through the formal permissions for fracking.”, His analysis shows that of 4,500 oil wells fracked in the US from 2000-10, 89% would not be defined as fracking in the UK, along with 43% of US gas wells fracked over the same period., “This is a clear opportunity for gaming the system so I argue that acid treatments onshore should stop, until a coherent set of regulations is produced and with clarity about who polices those regulations.”, Campaigners claim acid stimulation brings with it many of the same risks as fracking, such as water, soil and air contamination, and earth tremors., The Weald in Surrey and Sussex is a prime target for onshore oil and gas extraction. A local resident has launched a campaign to fund a judicial review into the council’s decision to grant 20 more years of oil production at the Horse Hill site near Horley., Brenda Pollack, the south-east regional campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said residents near areas at risk of potential acid fracking should remain vigilant. She said: “It could be worse for those communities now because with this moratorium, companies are going to be turning to those sites where they can get their feet in the door, or their drills in the ground.”, However, industry representatives say the use of acid is standard practice and should not cause concern. Ken Cronin, the chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said: “Acidisation, both in the water industry and our own, is a regulated practice that allows us to effectively ‘clean’ or improve recovery from a well. It dissolves fine particles and scale, allowing a better flow of what we’re trying to extract., “As with household kettles, which need to be treated for limescale build-up, the use of this process merely increases the efficiency of our practices. An environmental permit is only issued for this technique if the Environment Agency are satisfied that the proposed activities meet the requirements of all the relevant legislation.”activists warn of fracking by stealth and call for acid fracking ban", "label": 0}, "train-112": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a population explosion of garden pests on my windowsill\n, Crook, County Durham: Unnoticed in the withering roses, the overwintering aphid eggs experienced a premature spring, \nPhil Gates, \n\nFri 17 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, Virgin births took place on our dining table at Christmas. After a frost-free December, I had cut the last rosebuds from the garden and by Christmas Eve they had opened enough to make a table decoration. It was left forgotten on the windowsill until Twelfth Night, when the withered flowers, infested with rose aphids (Macrosiphum rosae) and sticky with honeydew, were about to be consigned to the compost heap., Unnoticed, overwintering aphid eggs had experienced a premature spring. What followed was spectacular, thanks to these insects’ capacity for parthenogenesis, asexual reproduction from an unfertilised egg, without male involvement. When they emerge from an egg they are all females, multiplying via virgin birth, cloning themselves with production-line efficiency: a rosarian’s nightmare. It only takes one greenfly hatchling to start a population explosion., I watched over the course of an afternoon. First a small, elongated blob appeared at the tip of a mother’s abdomen, swelling into an infant whose legs finally extended as she lowered it on to the rose stem. Throughout, the mother’s stylet, acting like a hypodermic syringe, tapped the rose’s sugary sap: seamless feeding and breeding, each newborn gravid with developing embryos for the next generation, even before inserting its own stylets for the first time., Scores of aphids were aligned head-to-tail along the flower stems but their food source was dying, so some had transitioned into the dispersal phase of their life cycle, when winged adults take flight in search of a fresh host plant. This would be the moment when gardeners hope salvation will arrive, in the form of natural predators like hoverfly, ladybird and lacewing larvae that wreak havoc on greenfly populations, or wasps that can’t resist eating these sweet treats., Our precocious Christmas population would never reach the final step in the breeding cycle, when males appear in autumn and fertilise the new generation of overwintering eggs that females will lay, before dying., I dropped the dead roses in the garden compost bin. A wren was searching for food among withered stems of last summer’s flowers: for every aphid egg it finds, there will be thousands fewer greenfly on the roses next summer.country diary a population explosion of garden pests on my windowsill", "label": 0}, "train-113": {"text": "\nBiggest food brands 'failing goals to banish palm oil deforestation'\n, Commitments to phase out deforestation by 2020 are out of reach for many, reports find, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nThu 16 Jan 2020 19.01 EST\n\n, Some of the world’s biggest brands are failing in their commitments to banish deforestation from their supply chains through their use of palm oil, despite making public claims to environmental sustainability, according to two reports., Scores of the world’s biggest consumer brands have agreed to phase out deforestation through the use of sustainable palm oil by 2020, but this goal looks far out of reach for many, according to separate reports from the campaigning groups WWF and Rainforest Action Network., Many of the companies highlighted as performing poorly or missing targets are household names, including Kellogg’s, Mondelez and General Mills, whose brands include Yoplait and Häagen-Dazs. In the UK, major brands such as Greggs, Warburtons, Reckitt Benckiser and Associated British Foods also ranked relatively low in the table., In its annual scorecard report on major companies’ performance in reducing deforestation from their use of palm oil, WWF found that only 15 out of 173 companies surveyed were performing well and “leading the way”. Thirty companies were judged to be lagging behind, while 41 failed to respond., You may not have heard of palm oil but you certainly eat it, probably every day. It is the most widely consumed vegetable oil in the planet, representing a third of all vegetable oil. It is used in many foods, from margarine, chocolate and cookies to bread and instant noodles., About a quarter of all palm oil is used for other things, such as shampoo, soap and lipstick. It is also burned as biofuel in vehicles, though the EU is phasing this out., Palm oil drives the destruction of tropical forests, especially in south-east Asia. Orangutans, the world's largest tree-dwelling mammals, are particularly under threat as their habitat is cleared for plantations, as well as species of elephant and rhino. About 20% of palm oil is now certified as \"sustainable\", though critics say the environmental benefit is marginal., To avoid palm oil, the most important thing consumers can do is read the label. A small but increasing number of products are now labelled as palm-oil-free. They may cost more, as palm oil is so widely used because it proved a cheap substitute to traditional fats such as cocoa butter in chocolate. However, some alternatives have their own problems: cocoa butter, for instance, has been linked to slavery and child labour., The WWF survey awarded companies points out of 22 based on answers to a questionnaire on their practices in sourcing palm oil. Ferrero, the Italian chocolate maker, was the only company to exceed 20 points. The UK retailers Marks &amp; Spencer and the Co-operative Group also scored highly, with 18.75 and 18 points respectively., Emma Keller, palm oil expert at WWF-UK, said: “Consumers don’t want their food or other purchases to come with a side order of deforestation and destruction of wildlife. But after a decade of promises, too many companies have failed to deliver. They must prove to their customers that they’re not selling products involved in destroying nature, and that they’re fully committed to a world where unsustainable palm oil no longer exists.”, Palm oil is found in a wide range of foods and some cosmetics and household goods, but its production is often problematic. The race to satisfy growing demand over the past two decades has resulted in vast plantations replacing native forest in countries in south-east Asia, while efforts to prevent forest destruction have often been stymied by corruption or companies flouting the rules., Companies are under pressure to improve their performance as the deadline looms for compliance with commitments under the Consumer Goods Forum, which will meet in June in London. That commitment, which began in 2010, involved a resolution by companies to reduce deforestation through their palm oil supply chain to net zero by 2020. Net zero means that some deforestation could be made up for by restoring or growing forests elsewhere., Separately, the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) assessed eight global brands – Kellogg’s, General Mills, Mondelez, Hershey’s, Mars, PepsiCo, Nestlé and Unilever – involved in a key area of south-east Asia known as the Leuser ecosystem. The survey found none were performing adequately in avoiding “conflict palm oil”, defined as palm oil whose production is leading to deforestation, loss of peatland or other habitat, and exploitation of workers or indigenous peoples., “The policy commitments of all eight companies have not stopped deforestation, threats to endangered species, or delivered respect for human rights or remedy for exploitation of indigenous peoples, local communities and workers,” said RAN. “All companies have increased transparency and begun reporting on the palm oil mills they source from, but to date not one company can communicate to consumers the plantations or farms where all the palm oil they sourced was grown. None of the companies have adequate systems in place to identify and cut or reform non-compliant suppliers in their supply chains.”, Robin Averbeck, of RAN, said: “None of these companies has a plan to verify credibly that they are not causing deforestation from palm oil. They only respond when NGOs publicly shame them. Their claims are greenwash.”, Ignacio Gavilan, environmental sustainability director at the Consumer Goods Forum, said new approaches were needed for companies to meet the pledge made in 2010 to end deforestation associated with palm oil use by 2020. “In 2010, our strategy was rooted in remediating individual company supply chains, often through certification. While we have seen progress, we have found that certification is a tool, but not the comprehensive solution the world needs,” he said., One problem is that there is still a market for palm oil products from deforested areas, so broader initiatives than certifying some areas as sustainable production are needed, otherwise unsustainable producers can simply move to clear new areas of forest and still find a market for their goods. Solving that conundrum is likely to require more involvement from governments and international moves to close down markets for the products of deforested areas., “The singular focus on certifications incentivised us to think small,” said Gavilan. “We want, and need, a more transformative approach that will get us to a more forest-positive future.”, Many companies rely on the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil as an assurance to consumers that they are taking the product from sources that are not leading to deforestation. However, Averbeck said there were problems with the certification and it was “inadequate” as a guarantee that the palm oil in use was not leading to deforestation. “RSPO is not working, fundamentally. Companies know that there are issues with RSPO.”, RSPO said: “We acknowledge the need for continuous improvement of RSPO strategies and interventions, which is why our membership continues to improve our standard. The situation on the ground requires companies, government and civil society to work together to achieve the mission of the RSPO. , “RSPO is more than just a certification system – it is a convening organisation that brings together stakeholders to discuss the issues. It has helped spur the development of sector-specific national initiatives to promote sustainability. Our goal is to transform the entire industry – a difficult mission – and we are proud of the progress achieved, while also firmly acknowledging there is a lot more work to be done.”, Many of the companies investigated by RAN and WWF told the Guardian they were working to improve their performance on palm oil, with some citing the Consumer Goods Forum 2020 target as a key aim., Mars said: “RAN’s conclusion is that, despite industry initiatives, a number of environmental and social threats to the landscape remain. This is precisely why we are working to radically transform the way we source palm oil at Mars with our Palm Positive Plan that aims to deliver 100% deforestation-free palm oil by the end of 2020 and to advance respect for human rights across our suppliers’ extended supply chains.”, Mondelez said it had blocked 10 palm oil growers based on recent cases, in addition to two longstanding exclusions, as evidence of its commitment to rooting out abuses in its supply chain. “This highlights the urgent need for sector-wide monitoring to provide one source of verified data on deforestation by palm oil plantations, based on the principles of transparency, group definitions, multi-stakeholder governance and independence. We are actively working with others to establish this.”, General Mills told the Guardian: “While we have elevated standards and protocols in place, our approach is continually evolving and, in line with our commitment to protect forests and peatlands, we increasingly see a need to support on-the-ground activities that address the drivers of deforestation. This demands action beyond the supply chain, but a lasting solution will require concerted action from all actors, including government and smallholder farmers.”, Unilever, which scored 34th in the WWF table and came out best of the eight companies in the RAN report, said: “Only by all parties coming together, using cutting-edge technology to carefully monitor our forests and engaging with the communities and stakeholders around them, will we create a sustainable future. We remain committed to working in partnership with suppliers, governments, NGOs and the wider industry to end deforestation.”, Whole Foods Market, which scored only 8.25 out of a possible 22 in the WWF table, said: “We made a public pledge over 10 years ago to use only 100% RSPO palm oil in own brand food products. We recognise that there is more work to be done and are actively exploring opportunities for improvement.”, Warburtons, which scored 12.75 in the WWF ranking, said: “We are shortly set to hit the 2020 target of ensuring the small amount of palm oil we use is 100% segregated, and our focus is now on making improvements through the supply chain.”, Greggs, which received only 9.5 points, said: “Greggs is a member of the RSPO and 100% of the palm oil we use is sustainable.”, • Additional reporting by Sarah Butlerbiggest food brands failing goals to banish palm oil deforestation", "label": 0}, "train-114": {"text": "\nLuxury travel: 50 wealthy tourists, eight countries ... and one giant carbon footprint\n, \nLuxury travel: 50 wealthy tourists, eight countries ... and one giant carbon footprint\n, \nRupert Neate, \n\nSat 18 Jan 2020 12.10 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Sat 18 Jan 2020 11.00 EST\n\n, Forget cruises. The super-rich have found a new way to see the world in the luxurious style of an ocean liner but taking a fraction of the time: private jet round-the-world tours., This week, 50 members of the wealthy elite will board a privately chartered Boeing 757 to begin a 24-day guided tour of the globe, taking in Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, the Galápagos islands and mountain gorillas in Rwanda., The trip involves 10 flights, 23 nights in five-star hotels or lodges, meals in some of the world’s most famous restaurants, champagne and “every single tip”. Thrown in are tour guides, an engineer, seven cabin crew, a chef and an “expedition physician”., The cost is £108,000 a person for couples, or £118,800 for one. The cost to the environment is the emission of 13 tonnes of carbon dioxide per passenger, according to research for the Observer by analysts at the clean transport campaign group Transport and Environment. It would take a typical family of four driving to their annual holiday on the south coast of France more than 30 years to rack up the same emissions. Going by train, they could make the same trip 150 times before reaching the same level of emissions., The jet used for the trip, which is described by the organiser, TCS World Travel, as “the Ferrari of commercial jets”, has been designed for well-heeled clients. The plane, which can carry up to 295 passengers, has been reconfigured to accommodate 50 customers in business class seats. The carbon footprint will be almost six times more per person than if the plane was filled with economy class travellers. TCS said it had paid to offset all flights., If you are thinking of joining the tour, you’re too late. The trip sold out months in advance., When the trip is completed, it’s a quick turn around before a fresh set of wealthy passengers begins another round-the-world adventure. The next 25-day trip includes Machu Picchu, Easter Island, the Great Barrier Reef, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and a safari in the Serengeti. It starts in late February and has also sold out., At least three other companies, including the luxury hotel chain Four Seasons and the Singaporean hotel chain Aman, offer similar trips., Four Seasons’ trips include an onboard chef. “It’s the highest Four Seasons restaurant in the world,” says Kerry Sear, Four Seasons’ executive chef, in the marketing video. “I often hear, ‘how are you going to wow us on this trip, Kerry?’., “The social area on the plane is really exciting for me as the chef. Every hour there will be something to snack on, it could be something from the location we left, or something highlighting the location we are going to. You are going to have people who expect a three-star Michelin experience, but then you’ve got somebody who really wants a peanut butter jelly sandwich.”, Shelley Cline, the president of TCS, said the company had commissioned a dedicated private jet from Airbus to replace the Boeing 757 next year, with 52 Italian leather fully-flat beds., Cline said many of the travellers were entrepreneurs who had made millions from their own businesses. “Many are self-made and want to enjoy themselves after all that hard work, but no matter their age or how they make their living, they are all curious about the world,” she said., “Time-saving is absolutely one of the big selling points about our trips. We fly direct, which also eliminates the hassles of airport layovers. We did a calculation, and to do the same around the world trip on commercial air would take 10 more days (34 vs 24) and would entail 11 more flights, 39 more hours of flying time and about 74 more hours waiting between flights., “Another reason people take our trips is for the special experiences and access that would be prohibitive to do on their own. Whether it’s getting into the Hermitage before it opens to the general public, having an amazing private dinner at a temple at Angkor Wat, or having dinner with royalty in some countries, we are able to provide our guests experiences that last a lifetime.”, Cline said TCS prided itself on thinking of everything a traveller might need, extending to all but writing postcards to families and friends for them., “They don’t have to handle their luggage, we fill out their immigration forms (well, they do have to sign them),” she said. “We even provide stamped postcards and spending money in the local currency at every stop.”, Guests are accompanied by experts who give lectures on destination stops, including David Keeling, a professor of geography at Western Kentucky University., “As a cultural geographer I focus on destination context, such as demographics, economics, geopolitics, history and resource management,” he said. “Most of my lectures have an environmental component. For example, we are visiting the Maldives and my lecture for that destination covers the impacts of climate change, geopolitical implications for small island communities, and economic challenges. I talk a lot about carbon footprints and carbon offsetting, something that TCS is very sensitive about, and the company provides opportunities for guests to offset their footprint.”, Jack Ezon, founder and managing partner of luxury travel agency Embark Beyond, said organised round-the-world private jet holidays started booming in popularity about four years ago. “They really give people the opportunity to explore the world in the limited time they have,” he said. “You’re not going to be able to deep dive into Cambodia in a single day, but it enables you to stitch together a story from around the world. By looking at how quickly it’s proliferating, there are clearly enough people with enough money for this.”, Ezon said most guests were baby boomers. “It is usually the cruise client who has done every port of call, and is looking for new experiences. They’re not just any old trip. They make it an experience, they do dinners in palaces or parties on the Great Wall of China. They really go beyond what you expect, and to places that ordinary clients travelling on their own wouldn’t be able to go to.”world tour luxury jet", "label": 0}, "train-115": {"text": "\nBeetles and fire kill dozens of 'indestructible' giant sequoia trees\n, \nBeetles and fire kill dozens of 'indestructible' giant sequoia trees\n, Deadly interaction between insects, drought and fire damage have forced California’s park officials to trigger climate crisis plans intended for the 2050s, \nPatrick Greenfield and Mette Lampcov, \n\nSat 18 Jan 2020 04.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Jan 2020 03.55 EST\n\n, Giant sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on the planet – some more than three millennia old – have started dying from beetle attacks linked to the climate emergency, the preliminary findings of a new study have revealed., The deaths of the trees, some of which lived through the rise and fall of hundreds of empires, caliphates and kingdoms – not to mention the inauguration of every US president – have shocked researchers in their speed and novelty. , In Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks in the Sierra Nevada, California, 28 giant sequoias have died from a seemingly deadly interaction between bark beetles, drought and fire damage since 2014, according to a joint National Park Service and US Geological Survey study that will be published later this year., Beetle attacks appear to have killed the trees in previously unseen ways, claiming mature standing giant sequoia trees known as monarchs. In addition to the beetle attacks, high-severity fires strengthened by drought and decades of natural wildfire suppression have killed 12 giant sequoias since 2015 in the national parks., The deaths have challenged age-old assumptions about the tree, which only grows on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada and is fabled for its near-indestructibility, attracting visitors from across the world., “It’s unheard of. It’s never happened before,” said Dr Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science for Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, who oversees the welfare of ecosystems in the parks. “You think giant sequoias don’t die in fire, you think giant sequoias can’t be killed by insects. That’s not true any more.” , According to more than 100 years of records preceding California’s 2012-16 drought, sequoia trees either died by falling over or suffering near total crown scorch in wildfires, never while standing upright. But since the historically hot and dry drought, researchers have recorded trees dying “from the top down” with the notable presence of bark beetles in their crown. , Although the number of trees that have died is a small proportion of the approximately 6,000 sequoias in the park, Dr Nathan Stephenson, the US Geological Survey forest ecologist who conducted the research, said he expected more to succumb to beetle attacks if, as expected, droughts become more severe and frequent in the future due to the climate crisis., “I don’t expect a threshold to be passed, at least in my lifetime, when there’s suddenly gigantic outbreaks taking out whole groves of giant sequoias. I suspect it will be beetles continuing to hit the most stressed sequoias but they will be doing more sequoias, because there will be more stressed sequoias.”, Stephenson said while there were no beetle attacks marked in park records, he suspected it might have happened before “deep in history”, but more needed to be done to understand what the insects were doing to the trees., Climate crisis contingency plans for giant sequoia tree deaths and high severity wildfires made for the 2050s are being enacted now, the National Park Service said. Ecologists are considering taking measures such as planting seedlings at higher elevations outside the areas sequoia trees usually grow and increasing prescribed burns to thin the forest as much as possible., Fire is vital to ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada mountains, clearing the forest floor and allowing new seedlings to establish themselves. The sequoia tree needs slow burning fire to reproduce, but decades of fire suppression has meant that burns have not taken place in some parts of the forest for over a century., As a result, the buildup of fuel in the forest means that when fires do take place, they are more intense than usual, killing sequoia trees in the process., “For the sequoias that died in fires, it’s a combination of past management practices plus the hotter drought that ganged up to kill so many,” Stephenson explained. “Sequoias have died in past fires when it hasn’t been an extreme hot drought, but it was fewer. Again, it might be a warning shot across the bow that if it continues to warm as projected, you might get more severe, longer-lasting, hotter droughts and sequoias will be exposed to those kinds of wildfires.”, Tens of millions of trees have died across the US, ravaged by pests, wildfires and the effects of the climate crisis, research in August found. In February 2019, the US Forest Service announced 18m trees had died since 2017 in California, bringing the total to more than 147m for the years since the drought began in 2010., Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresbeetles and fire kill dozens of california indestructible giant sequoia trees aoe", "label": 0}, "train-116": {"text": "\n'This is not how sequoias die.

Then the unthinkable happened: trees started to die – and scientists began the search for answers, Photographs by Mette Lampcov, by  Patrick Greenfield, \n\nSat 18 Jan 2020 04.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Jan 2020 06.58 EST\n\n, The fable of the giant sequoia tree is an enduring tale of America’s fortitude. Standing quietly on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, the Californian giants can survive almost anything – fire, disease, insect attack, cold years, hot years, drought – so the story goes., The largest living organisms on the planet can grow over 90 metres (300ft) tall. When they do die after 3,000 years or so, the oldest trees, known as monarchs, usually succumb to their own size and collapse. Their giant trunks will rest on the forest floor for another millennium., But the miraculous story of the near-indestructible giant trees that millions of Americans tell their children is no longer true., The giant trees are a huge tourist draw. They can grow to over 90 metres tall, and stand for 3,000 years or so, the oldest and largest often felled by their own weight, For the first time in recorded history, tiny bark beetles emboldened by the climate crisis have started to kill giant sequoia trees, according to a joint National Park Service and US Geological Survey study set to be published later this year. Twenty-eight have gone since 2014. The combination of drought stress and fire damage appears to make the largest sequoias susceptible to deadly insect infestations that they would usually withstand., One of the 28 is the optimistically named Lazarus, which stands in the Giant Forest in Sequoia national park, surrounded by other sequoias and a handful of cedars and pines that died in California’s great drought., Lazarus, a dead monarch sequoia, stands surrounded by a handful of cedars and pines that died in California’s great drought, When Dr Christy Brigham, who is responsible for the welfare of the ecosystems in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, saw Lazarus for the first time, all she could do was weep., “This is a tree that has lived through 2,000 years of fires, other droughts, wet years, dry years, hot years, cold years. It’s been here longer than Europeans have been in this country and it’s dead. And it shouldn’t be dead. This is not how giant sequoias die. It’s suppose to stand there for another 500 years with all its needles on it, this quirky, persistent, impressive, amazing thing, and then fall over. It’s not supposed to have all of its needles fall off from the top to the bottom and then stand there like that. That’s not how giant sequoias die,” she says, standing next to the skeletal Lazarus as the occasional tourist wanders past., Dr Christy Brigham, who is responsible for the welfare of the ecosystems in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, Even as tens of millions of trees died around them in California’s historic drought, reassuringly the vast majority of giant sequoias appeared to stand strong, as they had always done. But in 2017, Dr Nathan Stephenson, a forest ecologist with the US Geological Survey, noticed a dead branch showing signs of beetle damage had fallen from a giant sequoia. Trees had died standing since 2014, but the fallen branches were the first indication of what might be going on. Other researchers took samples of live branches from the top of sequoias that were dying from the top down and incubated the branches for further research. , “Hundreds of beetles came out of these pieces of branch. We went back the next spring and that part of the tree that had been sampled was now dead,” he recalls, detailing how the giant sequoia faded to its death from the top down. Stephenson emphasises that there is still further research to do on how bark beetles are killing giant sequoias but he is clear on one thing., “I think beyond reasonable doubt in the limited set of circumstances, which was the most severe drought on record and all the trees had had a recent fire at their base, you can weaken giant sequoias to the point that bark beetles can kill them.” , Dr Christy Brigham locates a group of dead sequoias and observes a fallen monarch. Pieces of bark patterned with bark beetle galleries indicate that something is wrong with a nearby sequoia, The post-mortem site of another monarch that died in this way stretches along the forest floor a short walk from Lazarus. The tree, unnamed, had been felled and cut into chunks to protect tourists passing on a nearby road. At what would have been the top, the bark exhibits the telltale cause of death: the elegant spirals and grooves of beetle galleries, formed where the insects are thought to have entered and slowly killed the weakened tree., It is hard not to reflect on what the dead giant sequoia had endured and what awaits other trees in California’s groves. As CO2 levels continue to rise, wildfires grow in intensity and the climate crisis alters ecosystems in just a few years, what does the future hold for these giants of the forest?, “Predicting the future is a fool’s errand. But I would expect a ramping up of what we’ve already seen,” Stephenson says. Stephenson does not expect the widespread mortality events seen in other trees on the west coast but as everyone the Guardian speaks to emphasises, nobody has seen this before., The Giant Forest, situated within Sequoia national park, is a mix of white fir, incense cedar, sugar pine, ponderosa pine and giant sequoia trees. The grey trees here are dead; in areas of the national park tree mortality of some species is 70%, More than a century of fire suppression has hurt the health of these forests. Since the late 1880s, landscapes that are meant to burn regularly in California have not, causing a huge buildup of wood and dead trees on the forest floor. When the inevitable fires do come, they are increasingly not slow, smouldering blazes that clear the forest floor and invite new life to thrive. The fires are intense, more regular than they should be, incinerating monarch sequoias that should be able to survive., Those trees that have succumbed from the top down in the drought – flagging first, then turning deathly autumnal orange – now stand grey on the mountainside in their millions, including many at famous views in Yosemite., View over the Yosemite Valley as one of the first winter storms approaches, bringing much-needed moisture, Yosemite national park, famous for its climbing, landscapes and wildlife, is struggling to deal with the wave of dead trees. They line roads, threatening to topple on cars, campsites, buildings. Dead trees are felled every day just to keep the forest safe, but there is only so much that can be done., The bark beetle thought to have killed the sequoias, Phloeosinus punctatus, is different to the pine and spruce beetles that have claimed hundreds of millions of trees in Siberia, Europe and North America. But scientists are concerned about the classification of Phloeosinus and want further study., Whatever new information emerges, Brigham is clear: “I can see why people could be confused because we are standing in a bog looking at giant sequoias that we say were killed by drought. It also doesn’t help that we’ve been telling people for 100 years that drought, fire and insects don’t kill giant sequoias. And now what I’m telling you is that the combination of drought, fire and insects is killing giant sequoias.”, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresthis is not how sequoias die its supposed to stand for another 500 years aoe", "label": 0}, "train-117": {"text": "\nCountry diary: the psychology of seeing off those thieving pigeons\n, Great Casterton, Rutland: Those bangs are meant to sound like guns – because birds know what guns do, \nSimon Ingram, \n\nSat 18 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, Appearances aside, true peace is elusive here. The A1, just over a rise, keeps the background away from silence most days. It’s subtle, like an endless exhale, and you don’t notice it’s there – but you notice when it’s not. Sunday mornings come close. Then, you register other sounds. Different sounds. More deliberate. Designed to scare., I walk the lane that leads to a low amphitheatre of farmland four miles wide, and I hear one: a distant crack, softly reverberating. Sometimes they are dull and boxy, echoless, like a finger flicked against cardboard. Sometimes they sound like cannon, and bounce around the landscape’s shallow folds., Bird scarers are interesting. They’re battle tactics, as old as agriculture, that examine reflexive responses and enemy psychology across species borders. Consider the thinking behind anti-crop-picker methods: from scarecrows to plastic owls and herons (static, or with moving heads for sharper foes). From plastic bottles on windmills to “terror eyes” balloons to lasers to propane-powered bangers that pierce the Sunday silence. There are laws on these last, but not many: four bangs an hour are allowed, only during daylight and as loud as you want. The bang isn’t just to make the birds jump, I’ve read. They are meant to sound like guns, because birds know what guns do., That intelligence is critical. Here by the dry-stone wall of the lane I’m surrounded by wispy-winged bugs of some sort – odd, on such a cold day – too instinctive to be bothered by anything. Yet in the field there is a kite. Not a child’s kite: a decoy kite. The silhouette is unambiguous. The splay tail and hard angle of the wings make it a ringer for the red variant, reintroduced and thriving around here., It’s a strange feedback loop. Plastic, masquerading as a species driven out by farmers in the first place – now re-abundant for real. I wonder if the fake kite is putting the real ones off; two wood pigeons nibbling this field seem to be banking on it. Not long after, I hear the bang again. The pigeons don’t move.

Frankly, I think it is more likely than not that intercity fliers and the reluctant Tories of the now-collapsed red wall form two mutually exclusive groups., The bottom line is that both bailing out Flybe and pushing through HS2 are appalling options from an environmental perspective. The green way forward is simple and straightforward. Leave Flybe to sink or swim, keep air passenger duty as it is (or preferably hike it further), and scrap HS2.

This has resulted in an increase in intelligence being submitted to the force by ACT-trained security personnel.”, The report was discussed at a hearing of the scrutiny committee in June last year. Another paragraph said: “The key issues continue to be threats relating to international terrorism and domestic terrorism. In addition, the high-profile actions of Extinction Rebellion, which centred around non-violent disobedience, results in some disruption in the City, with the potential for the event to be hijacked or infiltrated by more extremist groups.”, Paul Stephens, an Extinction Rebellion member and former Metropolitan police detective sergeant, said on behalf of the movement: “With each new example revealed by the Guardian, the categorisation of Extinction Rebellion with terrorist groups looks more like a strategy to encourage intelligence gathering than an error and is in complete contradiction to the words of counter-terrorism policing. It is an obvious and unethical tactic which could lose the trust of valued sources., “We will never knowingly mislead the police, so why not speak to us directly? I hope that the gravity of this emergency and the need for communication and cooperation is understood.” , A City of London police spokesperson said: “City of London police does not consider Extinction Rebellion to be a terrorist organisation. Ahead of the protests in the summer, our officers, who have regular contact with businesses in the area, spoke to them to ask them to consider the impact of the protests on their business continuity, and to make plans accordingly.”, The Guardian revealed this month that Extinction Rebellion had been placed on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to authorities running the Prevent programme. Last week it was revealed that Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups were included in a counter-terrorism police document distributed to medical staff and teachers as part of anti-extremism briefings., Police chiefs said any such advice was issued by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) in the south-east of England and not in any other part of the UK, and they branded it an “error of judgment” and vowed to recall the guidance., City of London falls under a separate division of the CT policing network, Counter Terrorism Command (SO15), along with the Metropolitan police., The Guardian has since heard from teachers and council workers across the country who have received Prevent training that referenced Extinction Rebellion., A teacher from south London described a Prevent training session held at her school by a Home Office official, organised by the borough council last September. As part of the training, she was shown an image of a bag with an XR badge affixed., She told the Guardian: “The specialist went through five or six different groups – there was far right, Islamism, they were all things I’d seen before. The one that did stand out was Extinction Rebellion and climate protesting.”, A council housing officer whose borough falls within the counter-terrorism policing east region said two police officers provided a Prevent training session to staff in June last year in which they included Extinction Rebellion., “I was unable to concentrate for the rest of the session as I was so shocked by the appearance of Extinction Rebellion,” they said., A teacher at a college in the Midlands said they were in a induction session in November last year, a large part of which was given over to a representative from a West Midlands counter-terrorism unit., “For the most part she focused on rightwing threats but there was one slide that detailed some alt-right extremist groups alongside XR and surprisingly, Greenpeace,” they said. “It is entirely inappropriate that XR be considered a terrorist threat or even a group that is to be monitored. Doing so diminishes the threat from other groups and also utterly negates XR’s agenda of challenging climate change.”, In the north-west, evidence emerged of a Prevent interest in stickers advocating anti-fascism and tougher action on climate change, with images of the stickers circulated to council managers.

Rising sea levels and more frequent storms brought on by the global climate emergency have accelerated the erosion., Councillors will this week urge ministers to treat coastal erosion as a natural catastrophe like flooding, saying that there is a lack of national guidance and funding to help tackle the issue., Jane Evison, a councillor on East Riding council, said families whose homes were at imminent risk of sliding into the sea were liable to pay the full cost of demolishing their property and for their relocation., The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) provides up to £6,000 in retrospective funding towards the cost of demolishing each property, but Evison said the total bill was at least double that., “The’ve lost their home and the legal responsibility is on them – they don’t have that sort of money,” she said. “At the moment the only funding we have available to us is from Defra but it doesn’t cover the cost at all, and then the council is making up the remainder of what it costs.”, Evison said ministers should treat coastal erosion like flooding, where significantly larger pots of funding are made available to local authorities, homeowners and businesses to cover the bill for damage. She said: “We know sea levels are rising. It’s going to accelerate. It’s an act of nature we have no control over. We think it isn’t a special case – it’s the same as flooding – so we should be able to bid for genuine costs to help keep people safe.”, A council report, due to be discussed on Wednesday, found that some parts of the picturesque Yorkshire coastline were disappearing at more than double the average speed. On one two-mile stretch south of Withernsea, near Hull, 10 metres were lost in nine months last year, compared with a yearly average of four metres., The report states: “This erosion rate is expected to increase in future due to sea level rise and more frequent storm events linked to climate change, which will put even greater pressure on both the coast and council resources., “Despite this, there remains a lack of national policy guidance and funding mechanisms for adaptive management in locations where defences cannot be constructed or maintained.”, Prof Mike Elliott, who co-authored an academic report on coastal erosion, said the government was wary of “opening the floodgates” to potentially thousands of compensation claims for people living on the eroding east coast, which stretches from Bridlington to the white cliffs of Dover., A Defra spokesman said it was investing £1.2bn in coastal defences to protect 170,000 properties by 2021 and that it was working with local authorities on a £23m five-year scheme to monitor the erosion.treat coastal erosion as natural catastrophe uk ministers urged east yorkshire", "label": 0}, "train-121": {"text": "\nI eat only strangers' leftover food – and it's the best diet I've ever had\n, \nI eat only strangers' leftover food – and it's the best diet I've ever had\n, To try to combat the mountain of food waste, diabetic Andrew Mayers decided to live on what people chuck in the bin.

The shops are full of Christmas leftovers: those high-calorie, nutrient-light foodstuffs, now for sale at massive discounts – confectionery collections, deep-filled mince pies, presentation tins of chocolate biscuits. You exert all that willpower over the festive period, and just when you think it’s safe to go back into the supermarkets …, But in the last year I’ve pretty much stopped going into supermarkets. Or takeaways. Or fast-food joints. Not that I’ve stopped eating their products – I’ve restricted myself to hoovering up what other people bring on to the streets and squander: my own personal Deliveroo, free of charge., From quinoa salads discarded at farmers’ markets to pub grub abandoned by fellow diners, it can be quite a varied regime. Park yourself in a central London square on a nice day, and the pricey rice bowls from eateries such as Itsu or Benugo, often still laden with dumplings and prawns and spicy vegetables, pile up alongside overflowing bins. Once I ate my children’s leftovers. Now I eat leftovers from strangers., I’ve fought a lifelong battle with an urban environment that encourages unhealthy eating – the obesogenic environment, as it has now been defined – and, after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I seemed destined to be on the losing side. But after adopting a diet that friends and family and experts had deep reservations about, I feel transformed., On a good day I often can take a surplus home – my very own weekly shop, Friends dubbed me the Gutter Gourmet. My mum was horrified. My GP was concerned. It wasn’t just that they felt I would pick up some dreadful lurgy. They were worried about my mental health – this isn’t what decent people did. Certainly a dose of indecency has been the most efficacious medicine I could have hoped for., When I repurposed myself as the Gutter Gourmet, it was fuelled by anger at the criminal excesses of casual waste all around me (not as a way to save a few bob, as some who know me well contend). The government’s waste advisory body, Wrap, estimates a colossal 10.2m tonnes of annual food waste. Of that the household contribution is 7.3m tonnes. My particular harvest – restaurant plate waste and on-the-go squandering – is more difficult to quantify. Yes, restaurants and cafes bin more than 300m meals a year. But that’s before the consumers I clean up after get a chance to sink their teeth into the complacency industry. One telling survey by the environmental charity Hubbub estimated that our fast food habit generates a staggering 11bn items of mostly unrecyclable packaging waste a year, from cartons to napkins and plastic cutlery. According to my highly unscientific empirical survey, good food is binned in a third of these cartons, from Hawaiian sushi to garishly coloured meringues., But I was also triggered by the “there’s nothing I can do” apathy of individuals. A couple of years ago, when I was last in hospital with one of the many serious health issues I’d chalked up since that diabetes diagnosis, the bloke in the next bed would order his hot meals for lunch and dinner – and then ignore them when they were delivered, in favour of the grub his family brought in. I talked to him: how can you allow all these wholesome meals to go to waste, and all the effort that goes into producing them, and the nursing resources? It would be so easy not to order them every morning. All he had to do was not tick a few boxes on a form., He was not interested. Did he not see a link between his behaviour and systemic waste? Why should he change, when it was the system’s fault? It was his right to do with his food as he saw fit. He’d paid for it with his taxes. And what business was it of mine? For a minute I thought he was going to ask me if I liked hospital food. (I do.), In that hospital stay I gave up on education and plumped for action. If I stopped ordering my own meals, could I eat the ones he ordered and left untouched? It was a deal. When I was discharged, I had an epiphany. All around me were versions of my ward mate, coming out of shops with on-the-go edibles, and discarding them after a few bites or gulps. The Gutter Gourmet was loosed upon the world., I was diagnosed with diabetes on my 40th birthday. I tried to remedy the situation. I went jogging. I put vegetables in my morning porridge instead of sugar. Carrots. Broad beans. Spring onions. Broccoli. Kale. Spinach. If you persevere, they say your taste buds get used to anything. Mine refused to cast off the memory of crunchy brown sugar melting on hot oats. Every morning I fought the battle anew, and often lost., I diligently swallowed the pills – Metformin, Levothyroxine, Simvastatin – and jabbed myself with insulin twice a day. What I needed was an injection of willpower. The iron resolve I woke up with to keep all those satanic carbohydrates and sugary treats behind me always seemed to evaporate by mid-afternoon, usually just as the refreshment trolley arrived at work. What harm can one more toffee-coated flapjack do?, Quite a lot, it turned out. Since the onset of diabetes, my compromised immune system has got me into one mess after another. The steady gain of bodily fat decommissioned my number one defence against diabetes – exercise – and weaponised its severity. In the past decade I have clocked up five bouts of pneumonia; recurrent raging episodes of cellulitis (a deep-tissue bacterial infection you can see racing up your legs); ulcerated shins; a general vulnerability to every opportunistic infection going; and intermittent erectile dysfunction., A bloodstream full of sugar, as the top lung professor in my hospital trust put it, is a chemsex orgy venue for microbes. Then my GP weighed in. Unless I pulled my socks up, he warned, eyesight-robbing retinopathy, or peripheral artery disease leading to lower limb amputation, could be just around the corner., It wasn’t an idle threat – there are about 7,000 lower-limb amputations in the UK each year. I recalled visiting a friend who’d lost a leg in a car accident, years ago. The woman in the next bed on the amputation ward had diabetes. “My doctor told me I had a choice,” she cheerily informed me. “Either the chocolate goes or a leg goes. And I couldn’t give up my Cadbury’s.”, If I’d known as a child that my passion for Cadbury’s, and fry-ups and bakeries and condiments and cakes and puddings, would decades later have me hooked up to IV drips and emergency antibiotics, would it have made any difference?, Probably not. I am a child of the obesogenic revolution. Of course, they didn’t call it obesogenic back in the early 70s. We still had early closing, shops were shut on Sunday, and you couldn’t order so much as a pizza to be delivered. , But our local high streets were changing. In my part of south London, there was always a Wimpy bar or a greasy spoon caff around the corner. , The era of the microwave turned every corner shop into a takeaway. Vesta curries, Findus pancakes, Angel Delight for afters. Baby food for grown-ups, as we lounged in front of the TV. , The first layers of fat that would eventually entomb my pancreas and degrade its production of insulin – the hormone that breaks down glucose into energy in the cells – were being laid down. I am one of two and a half million people in the UK who would suffer. Boyd Swinburn, the New Zealand public health expert who gave the world the term “obesogenic environment”, concluded that the problem is not driven by greed or abnormal appetites, but is a normal response to abnormal environments – encapsulated by the conditions he felt were responsible for the high rates of diabetes and obesity in the Arizona reservations of the Native American Pima people, whom he studied in the late 1980s., My NHS dietician says Swinburn would have recognised similar issues in the south London I grew up in: the aggressive promotion of energy-dense but nutrient-light foods; the beginning of a discount, “bogof” (buy one get one free) checkout culture encouraging you to buy more than you need; high-street domination by takeaways and (relatively) fast food outlets; the ascendancy of sedentary screentime over outdoor exercise., Although it is estimated that 60% of adults in England are now obese or overweight, we are not actually consuming more calories than we were back in the mid-70s. Indeed, there is evidence that sugar consumption is actually falling. It’s the food we eat that’s different. As George Monbiot pointed out, we eat five times more yogurt; three times more ice-cream; 40 times as many dairy desserts; a third more breakfast cereals; twice the cereal snacks; three times the crisps. All the things I love. Fat-, salt- and sugar-laden foods that in excess can play havoc with the body’s appetite-control systems., If anything, after my diabetes diagnosis I found it tougher to shun these sugar-loaded foods – and I was weakest when I was on my own. In company, the judgmental gaze of family or friends around the dinner table was a huge deterrent. Try helping yourself to ice-cream when your daughter insists that it’s going to harm you. So, as if I had a secret porn or drug habit, I would wait until everyone was asleep before guzzling digestives or a tub of flapjacks. Away from home, I would find myself slipping into shops, putting transgressive treats into my shopping basket and binge-eating them in bus shelters. At least I never had any leftovers., Looking back at this furtive behaviour, with that pronounced element of lone gratification, it all seems very reminiscent of addiction. My willpower wilted in the face of all these temptations. All the guilt I felt about letting down all the people relying on me to stay healthy seemed to melt away. It was as if my brain had been hijacked., Of course, many would argue that this is what the obesogenic environment does. It exists to drive addiction. What chance an individual’s willpower when pitted against an industry that spends billions on coaxing us to overeat?, In London, in good weather, the food-wasters can be very generous. It helps that I work a few days a week at a very swanky magazine group, where very swanky takeaways are crammed, shockingly untouched, into the bins. Recently I extracted a punnet of “soaked berry oats with peanut butter burn”. Never had that before, and it made a great tea with the two doughnuts and a cucumber I found in a Puregym locker on the way home. I did wash the cucumber., On a good day I often can take a surplus home – my very own weekly shop. But not every day is a good day. Indeed, not every month is a good month. When the temperatures drop and the weather worsens, the outdoor street harvest withers. Cartons of pizza wedged into the bin slots – a big summer staple – lose their allure when they’ve been marinaded into mush by an autumnal downpour. It’s an opportunistic existence, and opportunity does not always knock. Occasionally I have to concede defeat and resort to cooking. It’s a simple back-up plan: oats and bulgur wheat online. Most mornings start with porridge. One or two evenings a week, I rustle up a wholegrain mush. It’s austere, but I like it. And so does my pancreas., There are seasonal compensations. In the cold weather, people shoal under cover, clutching their comfort food and scrupulously observing the ultra-fashionable law that the real comfort lies in throwing away more food than you eat. My perspective is not very scientific. But it seems to me that people are more profligate than ever, often behaving as if the debate about waste and single-use plastics does not apply to them., I have been accused of taking food from the mouths of homeless people. But maybe it’s a mark of how much surplus food there is that rough sleepers, who watch me searching for scraps, insist on passing on food items distributed to them by well-meaning shoppers. They won’t take no for an answer. The regular outside my local Aldi says I’m doing her a favour, because the store’s food is so cheap she doesn’t know what to do with all the stuff she’s given., The biggest compensation of all seems to be my health. For starters I have miraculously avoided all those forms of pestilence that my mother predicted would follow my “unsanitary” refuelling habits. Sorry, Mum. I feel rotten that I haven’t felt rotten. The real gains have been round my diabetes. Obviously I’m happy that my GP’s warnings that I might lose my eyesight, or a limb, have not materialised. I have lost a lot of weight – a key objective for diabetics, and something I had been trying and failing to achieve for years., How could I have done this on a diet leaning on the sort of carbohydrates – white bread, white rice, pastries, noodles – I am supposed to shun? My diabetic dietician had a theory. “The idea that diabetics can’t eat any carbs or sugary foodstuffs is misplaced. What’s important is moderation and minimising. Your exposure to over-consuming the wrong things has been massively reduced. You are generally eating a few small portions a day, and you have to work pretty hard to find your food. That’s a lot of steps you are doing, so in a way you have transformed yourself into a textbook patient.”, Eureka! The Gutter Gourmet diet is actually beneficial for my diabetes: a daily regime of more exercise, smaller portions, reduced calorific input, reduced fat on the belly and abdomen. Without realising it, I have been making healthy choices. For more than a decade I had tried, and failed, to tackle my morbidity through willpower alone. In the past couple of years I have been empowered by a sense of protest. I align myself with all those people who wash their clothes, and themselves, less to save water. Who don’t fly. It’s all about busting consumerist norms. I don’t feel enslaved, or intimidated, by food, or the food industry, any more. The Gutter Gourmet v The Obesogenic Environment?

Retired colleagues and I have regularly shared ideas and actions with young people and learned together how to take the movement forward., An example: at a recent Reforesting Scotland gathering, one of the workshops was on XR and how a group of 70, mainly young, XR activists had responded to a call for volunteers and joined experienced foresters to plant trees at Gameshope, a Borders Forest Trust rewilding project in the south of Scotland.

Is it true?\n, The Coalition claims it’s meeting its targets and doing more than Labor did in power. What’s the reality?, \nAdam Morton Environment editor, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2020 19.49 EST\n\n, The prime minister says the Coalition is acting on emissions, meeting its targets and doing more than Labor did when in power. What’s the reality?, No., National emissions peaked in 2007, the last year of the Howard government, came down each year under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, and have flatlined since the Coalition was elected in 2013., This graph by Nick Evershed, Guardian Australia’s data and interactive editor, sets it out clearly., (Specifically, that they are on average 50m tonnes less each year under the Coalition than Labor.), This was not correct until last year, when the government released revised historic emissions data (as explained here). Since then, Morrison’s claim is roughly accurate., But it is a meaningless statistic – a clear case of nonsense framing to mask what is happening., Labor can’t be held responsible for the historically high emissions level it inherited when it came to office, and pollution fell about 14% in the nearly six years Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were prime minister., The ALP can’t take all the credit for the decline. The millennium drought, the global financial crisis and a high Australian dollar all had some impact. But government policies, including the carbon price scheme introduced in partnership with the Greens and independents, had some effect., Emissions reductions stopped under the Coalition about the time the carbon price scheme was repealed in 2014., The most recent quarterly greenhouse data found rising pollution in most parts of the economy were offset by a significant fall in emissions from agriculture due to drought and floods – a shift that has nothing to do with the government., This is where we risk getting buried in numbers, but bear with me., It makes sense for governments to set emissions targets. How else to assess whether countries are playing their part in addressing a dramatically escalating global problem?, But the most important initial question about a government target, before asking whether it will be met, is whether it addresses the problem faced., As far back as 1990, the Coalition went to an election under Andrew Peacock promising to cut emissions 20% by 2000., But Australia’s first target under the Kyoto protocol, the initial climate pact signed in 1997, allowed it to increase emissions by 8% above 1990 levels by the years 2008-2012., Put another way, the Howard government adopted a goal that allowed it to emit even more heat-trapping gas as part of an agreement under which developed countries were supposed to be cutting pollution., As has been well ventilated, it was no accident that 1990 was chosen as the baseline year. There was a hell of a lot of land-clearing and deforestation that year, releasing a stack of carbon dioxide. As the graph above shows, emissions plummeted after 1990, largely because land management in Queensland changed., It meant Australia had set itself a target that allowed it to not just increase pollution by 8%, but dramatically ramp up emissions from fossil fuels and other industry., As this graph shows, that’s what happened. It leaves out emissions of what is known as LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) – which are important, but have been used to muddy the picture – to show Australian pollution from electricity, industry, transport, agriculture and waste is up about 30% over three decades., So, yes, Australia “beat” its first Kyoto target., If it had used any year after 1991 as the baseline it wouldn’t have., And fossil fuel emissions – the primary driver of the climate crisis – have continued to rise., Australia’s 2020 target is usually described as a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020., As analysts and politicians have pointed out, it is neither meeting nor beating that goal., Government data shows emissions are expected to be just 0.3% lower this year than at the turn of the millennium., Again, the wonders of greenhouse accounting., As the ANU economist Stephen Howes explains, Australia’s 2020 target was expressed in more than one way. It was also listed with the UN as a 0.5% cut below 1990 emissions levels – that baseline year again – for the average of the years 2013 and 2020., Under that complicated formulation, Australia will technically beat its 2020 target., But it will still be putting the same amount of heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere this year as it was 20 years ago., Not much., The Department of the Environment and Energy projects that pollution will be only 4% lower in 2030 than today., It expects that despite assuming that, due to the falling cost of solar panels and some state-based targets, renewable energy will rise to provide 51% of electricity in the national grid by then (a level that the government opposed as damaging to the economy at last year’s election)., If the department projections are correct, it means we will not have made a 5% emissions cut below 2000 levels by 2030, let alone 2020., That, despite Morrison claiming it will be met “in a canter”, the government is not on track to meet that either., Before getting to the specifics, it is worth considering what was agreed in Paris, and what it means for Australia., The headline goal of the 2015 pact was to limit global warming to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and trying to keep it as close to 1.5C as possible. Scientists say that means net zero emissions by about 2050., That this is the implicit target of the Paris agreement is now broadly accepted across the engaged community. More than 70 countries say they are working towards that goal., In Australia, a coalition of groups including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Energy Council issued a statement in December saying the country should adopting policies that put it on a path to net zero national emissions., Every state, whether run by the Coalition or Labor, has a net zero emissions goal., The Morrison government doesn’t., Asked by 3AW’s Neil Mitchell on Monday about a suggestion federal Labor would recommit to net zero emissions by 2050, the prime minister said he had “no idea what the Labor party is talking about”., Pressed further, he acknowledged the government promised at last year’s Pacific Islands Forum, where Australia faced sustained criticism from island nations for its support of the coal industry, that it would consider it. But he stressed he was concerned that “it wouldn’t be a good thing” and did not think it should be adopted unless it was clear what it would mean for jobs., Australia disregarded scientific advice in setting its initial, medium-term target under the Paris agreement. The then Abbott government was advised by the Climate Change Authority that Australia’s part under a meaningful global pact would be equivalent to a cut of between 45-63% below 2005 levels by 2030., It instead opted for a 26-28% reduction over that timeframe., Again, there was some fudging. Rather than stick with 1990 or 2000, the government opted for a baseline year that – as emissions were substantially higher in 2005 than in 2000 – made the proposed cut appear larger., If the government had stuck with 2000 as the baseline, its Paris target would be a 16-18% cut., Department data suggests national emissions are expected to instead be 16% below 2005 levels by 2030, well short of the minimum 26% goal. The government plans to make up the difference through another accounting measure: claiming credit for “beating” or, as it now describes it, “overachieving” its Kyoto targets., Using what are known as Kyoto “carryover credits” is politically and legally contentious, and opposed by many countries at climate talks., Critics say Australia is still trying to claim credit for a 30-year-old land-clearing loophole that it used against targets that were already far lower than what scientists said was necessary., Not so far. The government’s main climate policy remains the $2bn climate solutions fund, under which taxpayers pay businesses and land-owners to limit pollution, mostly by planting or protecting vegetation. Recent evidence suggests it is struggling to find people to sign up., In October, the government quietly commissioned a review of the policy in what was seen as an acknowledgement that it was not delivering what was needed., The Coalition supports some energy projects, particularly pumped hydro storage, and is promising a long-delayed electric vehicle strategy and a “technology investment roadmap”., Morrison says Australia is leading the world on renewable energy, and emissions from the electricity sector have fallen while those from other sectors increase. But spending on clean power fell 56% last year, and the government has rejected calls for an overarching policy to drive private investment., Australia is responsible for about 1.3% of pollution, but has only 0.3% of the global population. It is one of the top 20 emitting nations, releasing more than G7 members Britain, France and Italy., It is also the third biggest exporter of fossil fuels and aims to expand the trade., Several analyses have found that, even by the inadequate standard of international action to address the climate crisis, Australia is performing poorly., Science and policy body Climate Analytics says it is expected to fall even further behind because, unlike comparable countries, it has no plan to introduce an effective national emissions reduction policy.scott morrison says the government is acting on emissions is it true", "label": 0}, "train-124": {"text": "Live export: animals at risk in giant global industry, \nLive export: animals at risk in giant global industry\n, More demand for meat sets nearly 2 billion farm animals on the move a year despite concerns about poor transport conditions and inhumane slaughter, by  Hilary Osborne and  Bibi van der Zee, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 07.12 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 20.02 EDT\n\n, The global trade in live farm animals has more than quadrupled in size over the past 50 years, but patchy regulation means animals may be put at risk on some journeys, or exposed to cruelty when they reach their destination., Every year nearly 2 billion farm animals are loaded on to trucks or ships and sent to new countries in journeys that can take days and sometimes weeks. Every day, at least 5 million animals are in transit., As the trade has grown, profits have rocketed. In 1988, the global trade in all live animals was worth $716m (£548m); by 2017 that had risen to $21bn, according to Comtrade data. These figures do not take inflation into account, but the rise has massively outstripped inflation over that period., This week the Guardian’s Animals Farmed series is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled over the last fifty years., Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks. , Every day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals. , And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down., We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. , Rising demand for meat in many parts of the world has been a boon for exporters who specialise in breeding or in animals that need to be fattened before slaughter. In the Middle East, in particular, animal imports have risen markedly: in 2016, Saudi Arabia alone imported nearly $1bn worth of live animals. Hong Kong’s reliance on importing animals from China has fuelled fears of greater dependence on the mainland., In turn, other countries rely on selling their farm animals overseas. Romania, for example, exports more than 2 million sheep a year. Sudan’s trade with Saudi Arabia – where it sends several million sheep annually – is one of its most important sectors. Australia, Denmark and Spain also have thriving export industries., But the steadily growing trade has led to concerns about the lack of oversight of animals in transit and when they reach their destination. Poor conditions during transportation and inhumane slaughter on arrival are two issues raised by animal charities that are calling for better regulation of the industry. There are also fears about the spread of disease., Investigations by officials and campaigners have highlighted problems at ports and borders where animals are left in hot vehicles, before being loaded on ships where there may not always be access to a vet. , Abuse or bad animal practices, such as cutting the tendons in a cow’s legs in order to stop it moving before slaughter, or repeatedly stabbing into the side of the neck in order to kill, have been exposed in a number of slaughterhouses in Egypt, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. NGO Eyes on Animals now works in slaughterhouses in Turkey in order to improve conditions., On top of this the Guardian has found that the ships licensed to carry animals are often old and dilapidated. In November a ship capsized just off the coast of Romania. More than 14,000 sheep drowned, although the crew were rescued., The consolidation of the slaughterhouse industry has led to additional problems. The US, UK and France have all recorded fewer, larger meat plants, meaning animals must travel longer distances, and even into other countries, for processing. There is no cross-Europe data, but industry insiders say the trend is similar., The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) is the agency responsible for setting standards on public and animal health, and has a role in creating rules for animal welfare. But it is not responsible for ensuring that these rules are adhered to or for punishing anyone who transgresses – that is still down to individual governments., Dr Matthew Stone, a deputy director-general of the World Organisation for Animal Health, said the group worked with its members and partners to define international standards and strategies for animal welfare and develop the capacity of veterinary services to implement those standards. “Our members have not given us the mandate to enforce compliance with our international standards – that remains the sovereign responsibility of each member country,” he said., “Our standards and strategies for animal welfare promote implementation of bilateral agreements for trade in live animals that address contingency arrangements during transport, such as mechanical failure or adverse weather events, and importantly in the context of international trade, contingencies for disease outbreaks or health events., “In such circumstances, our standards describe the responsibility to care for the sick animals, and if unloading at the port of destination is in their best interests, to facilitate quarantine, investigation, and decisions on the fate of the consignment. Humane treatment of animals remains an important consideration throughout the entire journey.”, After a series of crises, the governments of New Zealand and Australia took action to restrict live exports from their countries and increase monitoring of animals in transit. But other countries apply different rules, and the oversight of the regulations that do exist is patchy., The European Union has a set of regulations that cover live animal transport within the boundaries, and are supposed to cover them beyond. But although EU laws stipulate that exporters must be confident that standards will be met beyond the border, in practice this is difficult to ensure., Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser of campaign group Compassion in World Farming, said: “We’ve told the EU they should not be sending animals to places where this is happening., “There are international laws on animal welfare at slaughter set by the World Organisation for Animal Health, and we should not be sending animals to places where we know they are being broken,” he said., “Some of this is just habit. If the will was there for the EU to say – probably working with Australia – that there could be no more live exports, then it could be done.”, He said that the slaughterhouses he had seen in the Middle East were the worst he had seen., In the UK, the new Conservative government’s election manifesto committed to ending “excessively long journeys for slaughter and fattening”., Stevenson said: “The OIE should be doing much more to help its member countries to implement its standards on welfare during transport and slaughter. Many OIE member countries simply don’t know where to begin when it comes to implementing the OIE standards on welfare at slaughter.”, He said: “I don’t think a global body would really help with enforcement. We simply need the European Commission and other countries to enforce regulations rigorously.”, Reineke Hameleers, director of the lobbying group Eurogroup for Animals, said: “The EU needs to enforce the transport regulation until the destination in the third country. However, in practice this is very hard because the EU relies on working with many different third countries where no enforcement infrastructure is in place. Also, once the animals have arrived there is no way to ensure their welfare during transport and slaughter.”, “The existing legislation is not up to date, unenforceable and out of step with societal demands. There’s barely any legislation on transport by sea, and once the animals are outside the EU, there is no way of even monitoring standards, let alone enforcing them – and this goes for slaughter as well as transport.”, The group is calling for a total ban on live exports, and limits on journey times within countries.,  But Rupert Claxton of international food consultancy Gira, said that in almost all cases great care was taken with the animals when transporting them. “In the most basic terms, it doesn’t make sense not to take care of them,” he told the Guardian. “Commercially, exporters need the animals to be fit and well.” He said that the industry was always looking for ways to improve or reduce transit, but that, in Europe in particular, the growing distances between slaughterhouses made some travel unavoidable., “Mostly exporters are good,” said vet Paul Roger, chair of the UK-based Animal Welfare Science, Ethics and Law Veterinary Association. “But the emphasis is on profitable trade rather than welfare aims. An example might be the live export of sheep to the Middle East, and of recorded journey times being exceeded in the EU. I think we need to reassess what we permit and why we permit this trade.”live export animals at risk as giant global industry goes unchecked", "label": 0}, "train-125": {"text": "\n'It would be kinder to shoot them': Ireland's calves set for live export\n, An unwelcome byproduct of a booming industry, male dairy calves can endure a short and brutal existence, Sophie Kevany and \nMattha Busby, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 07.12 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 20.02 EDT\n\n, It would be “kinder to shoot” the hundreds of thousands of unwanted male dairy calves due to be born in Ireland this year, rather than export them to the Middle East or let them die on the farm, experts have told the Guardian., Irish farmers have hit a streak of gold on dairy exports, and as a result the industry has rapidly expanded, with the national dairy herd rising from about 1m in 2010 to 1.6m this year., But that creates a whole new problem. Dairy cows generally give birth every year in order to maintain their milk output. But male dairy calves are no use to the farmer as they cannot produce milk, which means that Ireland will need to deal with as many as 800,000 unwanted male calves this year, in what has been described by the Irish agricultural press as a “calf tsunami”., This week the Guardian’s Animals Farmed series is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled over the last fifty years., Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks. , Every day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals. , And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down., We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. , The situation is further complicated by Ireland’s “compact calving” system, which sees most calves born in a 12-week period from February to April, and the swift removal of calves from their mothers. Both increase the need for extra short-term labour, which can be costly or hard to find.,  The Irish beef trade has formerly been a useful outlet for unwanted dairy calves, but demand last year was sluggish, and selective breeding increasingly means that dairy calves may not be suitable for beef anyway., Exporting the calves is another option. Although campaigners are opposed to the trade, the Irish government has described it as “a vital safety valve for the beef sector”., The only alternative is to shoot the calf at birth, or to let calves die of neglect. In 2015–16 New Zealand, another country with a large dairy industry, was hit by the male  calf scandal when videos and reports of starved and abused male dairy calves were widely circulated by welfare organisations. , “The danger of having so many calves in 2020, on top of the existing pressures, means there is an emergency welfare case to be made, although no one wants to talk about it, for killing the calves on a one-off basis at three or four days old,” said a senior figure in Ireland’s state agricultural network. The source spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity for fear they might lose their job., “We know there is going to be suffering. We know the farmers can’t manage and we need to offer a realistic solution to ease that suffering, for the calves and the farmers,” the source said., “Vets often say they are only called to treat female calves. The whole reason New Zealand is in the situation of killing calves at four days old is because they had the same problems with valueless male dairy calves about four years ago., “Vets are not called to sick pigs in Ireland,” the source added. “And this is the way we are going with male calves.” Calves and pigs are worth significantly less than the cost of a vet, so it can be cheaper to simply let them die., Difficult as the decision is, the source said it was preferable to letting them “die in their own scour diarrhoea, which is what is happening now and we know is going to get worse”., Although most dairy industry professionals refused to openly discuss the possibility of a cull, Cork based cattle vet Bill Cashman spoke on the record. “When a male calf has no value, or is a net cost, with the best will in the world a farmer, especially when under intense day and night work pressure, will prioritise female calf care over the bulls.”, Although Cashman said it was a “wanton waste” to kill any animal at birth, the immediate priority was to ensure that “males are not suffering from a lack of care and disease” or spreading those diseases, and “that means a cull at one or two days old. I would not leave them longer.”, Asked how a cull might work, Cashman said, in line with the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe policy, he would prefer to see it happen on the farm, to avoid transport, by lethal injection. “It’s instantaneous. A visit could be made every second day during calving season.”, The option of exporting the calves may provide a financial return for farmers, but campaigners have queried the welfare implications of sending young, unweaned calves on long journeys by ship or truck. The minimum age is supposed to be 14 days, but the same source told the Guardian that it looks as if some farmers are registering calves as born earlier, in an attempt to get them off the farm as quickly as possible., European veal farms are the main export destination for younger calves, while older animals – male and female – tend to sell to Turkey, Libya, Morocco, Lebanon, Russia, Tunisia, Rwanda or Kosovo for beef and dairy use., Mistreatment has been well documented. In a 2018 report on farm animal welfare the European Court of Auditors noted Ireland was guilty of infringing calf transport rules. A 2016 investigation by Compassion in World Farming showed that some journeys were lasting over 27 hours, in cramped conditions with no drinking facilities. In May 2019footage taken at a at a French control post appeared in Cherbourg by animal activist group Eyes on Animals appeared to show calf mistreatment., There is also concern about slaughter conditions in non-EU countries., But the Irish government has repeatedly pledged its support for the export sector and has encouraged companies to form their own representative organisation. In January 2017, Ireland’s minister for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), Michael Creed, reportedly told the Irish Farmers’ Association annual meeting that the live export trade was “critically important”., There has been a rise in the number of cattle exported over recent years although the value of industry for livestock – at about €110m (£94m) a year – has declined 6% year-on-year., “It is not boosting the economy,” Caroline Rowley, from Compassion in World Farming, said. “It is not stimulating prices, live export volumes are going up each year but factory prices are not following. It is not helping the average livestock farmer. The only winners in this outdated industry are the exporters.”, Colorado-based animal science expert Dr Mary Temple Grandin told the Guardian that from a welfare perspective slaughtering very young calves is likely more humane than a long journey by sea without milk replacer. The drawback, she said, was a potential food waste issue. Asked what happens to their slaughtered calves, New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries said in an email they are “typically processed for pet food”, which goes some way towards addressing Grandin’s waste concerns., Although no farmer would endorse the idea of an emergency calf cull on the record, there was agreement on individual calf neglect issues. Denis Drennan is a dairy farmer and committee chairman with the Irish Creamery Milk Supplier Association. Drennan, who has 60 dairy cows, summed up the reaction of many farmers to the idea of a cull, saying if he was shooting animals at birth, he was not a farmer., Asked if male calves are sometimes left to die, or whether there are farmers who only call a vet for a female calf, Drennan said yes., Where a vet might cost about €150 at night, domestic prices for calves, which can earn farmers anything from €30 to €80 per head at auction, reportedly fell as low as €0.50 per head last year. Live exporters, meanwhile, estimate their 2020 prices would stay in the €30 to €60 range.,  Replying to questions about a potential emergency calf cull Ireland’s DAFM said by email that it “continues to engage with and work closely with stakeholders in relation to the incremental increase in the number of calves born on the dairy farms over the past few years, with a focus on rearing, management and market opportunities for such calves, including opportunities for intra-community trade to other EU member states.” The department’s statement went on to say that “in addition to its direct oversight of animals presented for export”, it will “continue its range of inspections and controls on farms and at sales to monitor compliance with animal welfare standards”., One result of that engagement appears to be a December DAFM announcement that Irish government veterinary inspectors “will accompany calves from Ireland to the control posts in Cherbourg”, without prior warning. It said too that rubber teat water drinkers will be mandatory for unweaned calves from 1 December 2020., Reacting to the new rules, Eyes on Animals’ Nicola Glen said she was pleased to see the “serious welfare issues associated with the transport of Irish calves” were finally receiving proper attention. However, she said it was unclear how the vet checks would work in practice and that although the new rubber teat rule was an improvement on the existing system of hard-to-access metal pipes, December 2020 was too far away. Eyes on Animals will continue its inspections until it sees concrete results, she added.it would be kinder to shoot them irelands calves set for live export", "label": 0}, "train-126": {"text": "\nTwo billion and rising: the global trade in live animals in eight charts\n, The world’s seas and roads are awash with farm animals, with almost two billion pigs, cattle, sheep and chickens trucked or shipped as exports in 2017, \nTom Levitt, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 07.11 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 20.02 EDT\n\n, In 2017, nearly two billion animals a year were loaded onto ships or lorries to be sent on journeys ranging from a few hours to six weeks and even more., Top of the list of animals being exported in absolute numbers are chickens. The amount of live chickens being moved around the world has ballooned by a staggering sixteen times in fifty years. , The numbers of other live farm animals (we collected data for pigs, cattle, sheep and goats) being exported has also grown dramatically over the past half a century, according to data from the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). This growth has shown no signs of slowing despite advances in refrigeration technology allowing fresh and frozen meat to be stored and transported and concerns around the spread of animal diseases such as African swine fever (ASF)., The trade is driven by appetite from all over the world, but the Middle East is a particularly key region, and has been a major importer of sheep since records were first collected by the FAO in the 1960s. Alongside Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Jordan also imported 400,000 sheep in 2017. The US figures are mostly made up of pig imports from Canada and cattle imports from Mexico. Just off the bottom of this list, the UK imported 500,000 live farm animals in 2017, most of which were pigs from Ireland. We’ve left out the figures for imports of live chickens as the numbers are so large they would distort the chart., If we included the figures for chicken in the list of biggest exporters then the Netherlands would be top. But even taking away live chickens, the Netherlands is the second largest exporter of live pigs, cattle, sheep and goats after Denmark. The Danes are top mainly due to a large trade in pigs with Poland (6.2 million in 2017). Australia has been a major exporter of sheep and cattle since the FAO records started, but its export numbers have fallen from a high of close to 6.5 million in 2000., France has been exporting more than a million live cattle a year since the 1970s, according to FAO data. The majority of the animals it exported in 2017 went to Italy (980,000) and Spain (490,000), but it also sent 11,000 live cattle to Morocco, 14,000 to Lebanon and 38,000 to Algeria. Mali’s live cattle exports mostly went to Senegal (240,000) and Ivory Coast (200,000)., The live sheep export market largely involves the animals heading to the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia (5.8 million), Kuwait (1.3 million), Qatar (590,000), Yemen (450,000), Jordan (400,000) and Oman (400,000) all major importers of sheep from Europe, Australia and Somalia. The other big sheep importers are Libya (1.2 million) and Italy (1 million)., Most of the live pig exports from Denmark and the Netherlands are to other European countries. Along with the 6.2 million pigs the Danes sent to Poland, the Netherlands exported more than 8 million pigs to Germany in 2017. China’s 1.6 million pig exports all went to Hong Kong in 2017, although that trade has since been hit by the outbreak of ASF, a highly contagious viral pig disease, that has wiped out some 40% of the Chinese pig population., European countries dominate the live chicken export market, with the Netherlands and Germany alone responsible for the export of almost 700 million chickens in 2017. A large proportion of both countries’ exports of chickens are to each other. The Netherlands also exported 16 million chickens to the UK, 4 million to Thailand and 1 million each to Uganda and Russia in 2017. Most of the exports of live chickens from Belgium, the Czech Republic and Hungary are to other European countries.two billion and rising the global trade in live animals in eight charts", "label": 0}, "train-127": {"text": "\nAnimals farmed investigates: the huge global trade in live animals\n, This week we’ll be taking a closer look at the reality and risks of the huge industry supplying the growing demand for meat, \nBibi van der Zee, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 07.11 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 20.02 EDT\n\n, Over the next week the Guardian’s Animals farmed series will focus on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has been growing at a pretty steady pace over the past 50 years., It’s not an industry that most of us think about very often, though meat consumption has become one of the big discussions of our time. , Most of us struggle to grasp the full complexity of the modern farming system, where an animal may be born in one location, transported to another for most of its life, then sent to a third – if it is a beef cow – for fattening, and at last to a final place for its death., Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries in journeys that can take weeks. Every day, at least 5 million creatures are in transit, as part of the secretive global trade in live farm animals. And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys; they do not include long journeys within a country., This trade is making money and creating jobs for farmers, operators and companies – and its defenders argue that the vast majority of transport is carried out in a humane, thoughtful way, overseen by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)., But it also raises a number of key issues – to which we are still seeking satisfactory answers:, 1) Why are animals being transported long distances live, rather than slaughtered, and then transported as refrigerated meat? Are economics trumping animal welfare?, 2) Is the animal disease notification system really working? Currently, countries monitor their own diseases, and notify OIE when they spot one. A ban may then be placed on the regions where the disease is present, or on the whole country. But at least one expert told us this leads to perverse incentives – and many pointed to the peculiar pattern of China’s notifications on African swine fever as evidence that the disease had been in the country for some time before China submitted a notification. Is there a better way?, 3) Why has the EU become such a key player in this global trade? EU countries figure heavily in the top exporters of live animals – and exports from the EU28 as a whole to the rest of the world have trebled to around $3bn a year since 2000 (again, that figure doesn’t include the huge trade in live animals within EU borders). Yet the EU prides itself on having one of the most progressive animal welfare policies in the world. Are the two things compatible?, Over the next week we’ll be examining a number of aspects of the global trade. Today we look at how this trade has grown and the implications. We also look at the situation in Ireland, where farmers are at a loss over how to deal with a potential “calf tsunami”., On Tuesday we look at the disease implications, speaking to international vets about the threats posed by the international animal trade. On Wednesday we look at some of the countries that have vigorous live animal industries – and the economic impacts., On Thursday we’ll look at why the trade has risen so steeply in Europe, and examine whether the shipping fleet is fit for purpose. On Friday we’ll look at the countries where the animals are consumed – and see how consumer preferences are playing a role in the global trade.

The defense department used AFFF for decades, leading to widespread contamination of ground and drinking water at military bases nationwide., The National Defense Authorization Act says AFFF incineration must now be conducted in accordance with the Clean Air Act (CAA) at permitted hazardous waste facilities., But Erik Olson, the Natural Resources Defense Council’s senior director for health and food, said: “There’s a need for much more significant research and regulatory action to make sure that disposal is done in a way that doesn’t just move the environmental problem around.”, Sonya Lunder, the Sierra Club’s senior toxics adviser for its gender, equity and environment program, warned that incineration is unlikely to fully break down toxic chemicals in AFFF, leading to PFAS compounds, including possible greenhouse gases, being emitted into the environment., The Guardian reported in December that these compounds have been detected in rainwater across the country at levels high enough to trigger regulatory action if found in drinking water., Experts also voice concern over the poor compliance histories at certain hazardous waste incinerators and the proximity to these plants of low-income, vulnerable communities., The Veolia-owned hazardous waste incinerator in Sauget, Illinois, for example, has been issued a high-priority violation of the CAA every quarter for the past three years. Over half of the population within a three-mile radius of the plant live below the poverty level., For Mamie Cosey, who lives less than a mile from the Veolia plant in Sauget, the defense department “absolutely” should not be allowed to incinerate AFFF so close to her home, she said. “Why do the residents have to suffer just because someone says that this is safe?”, Just turned 79, retired teacher Cosey is the guardian of three teenage great-grandchildren, and the “terrible” pollution already emitted from the plant causes her to worry that their asthma, headaches and other health issues will worsen, she said., “I don’t have but a few more years to live,” Cosey said. “But my great-grandchildren –how will they grow up? What’s the lasting effect of this on their life?”, Instead of incineration, said Lunder, the foam should be disposed of with technologies like those used to destroy the nation’s stockpile of obsolete chemical weapons., Indeed, the air force has already solicited proposals for alternative disposal techniques, citing possible key failures with incineration., Maureen Sullivan, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment, wrote in a statement that the defense department has been incinerating PFAS materials at hazardous waste facilities since 2016, “as it is more protective of human health and the environment”., The defense department did not answer how much AFFF is awaiting disposal. Early last year, the Intercept reported that the DoD was waiting to destroy 2m gallons of foam and contaminated water.defence department toxic pollution pfas foam", "label": 0}, "train-129": {"text": "\nBusinesses named on 'A-list' for tackling their climate impact\n, Sainsbury’s, Lego and H&amp;M feature on list that rewards shift to renewable energy and reducing emissions, \nZoe Wood, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 04.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Jan 2020 04.19 EST\n\n, Sainsbury’s, Lego and H&amp;M are among the businesses to make a prestigious A-list of companies that are deemed to be at the forefront of the charge to tackle the “existential” climate crisis., The list is compiled by non-profit group CDP which scores companies based on the environmental data they voluntarily disclose on its platform. Just 2% of the 8,000 companies it scores made the A-list, with Nestlé, Unilever, BT and Walmart among the 179 to make the cut. A focus on the climate emergency was not at the expense of business success, CDP said, with companies on the A-list also outperforming peers on the stock market by 5.5% a year., The company also has an F-list for companies that did not submit a response for climate change in 2019 – with Amazon and Facebook among the 9,225., Dexter Galvin, CDP’s global director of corporations and supply chains, said the A-list were “blazing a trail for others to follow”. He said: “Other companies should look to these leaders for inspiration and learn from them.”, “The latest science says we need global emissions to urgently peak and start declining by 7.6% a year to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis,” continued Galvin. “Companies can and should become part of the solution rather than part of the problem.”, With the financial performance of companies on the A-list better than their rivals, Galvin said this demonstrated that “leading on climate action is good business in today’s economy” and would be “essential business in tomorrow’s economy”., Unilever points to the success of its trophy sustainable brands – a group of 28 that includes Dove, Hellmann’s and Sunsilk – which are growing much faster than the rest of its business. The brands, which accounted for more than half of the group’s €51bn (£46bn) sales last year, are those that are the furthest ahead on meeting the company’s sustainability goals., A-list companies scored highly because of their transparent and comprehensive disclosure of climate data. Examples of best practice include setting science-based targets, shifting to renewable energy and incentivising suppliers to reduce their emissions., Lego, for example, was praised for increasing its use of recycled materials and plant-based plastics; two years ago it started selling Lego pieces made from plant-based plastic sourced from sugar cane. Sainsbury’s, meanwhile, has pledged to halve the amount of plastic packaging it uses over the next six years., H&amp;M, the Swedish group that also owns &amp; Other Stories and Cos brands, is aiming to have 100% recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030., CDP says investors and purchasers are calling for transparency and action from companies on how they are responding to climate change. businesses named on a list for tackling their climate impact", "label": 0}, "train-130": {"text": "\n'The streets are more alive': Ghent readers on a car-free city centre\n, We asked locals in the Belgian city to tell us how things have changed since the shake-up, \nGuardian readers and \nRachel Obordo, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 07.44 EST\n\n, The city has become a pedestrians and cyclists’ joy, especially for people like me who live in the city centre and have no car. As I type, they are busy turning our street into a low-traffic, communal woonerf or ‘living street’. It has become easier and safer to navigate the town on foot or by bike. Having recently returned from the Middle East the changes are even more striking, especially when it comes to my son. We were uncomfortable for him to cycle on the roads there but the ones here have been a fun and relatively stress-free experience. The changes have made an enormous difference to people’s quality of life. Khaled Diab, journalist and writer, Yes it was drastic, but I believe there is no other way if we want liveable cities. Banning cars isn’t the end of the world. I sold mine and switched to electric car sharing. I worried about it but didn’t use it as much as I thought. In town I use the bicycle and it makes me happy. There are some negatives though. Public transport could be better at times and the city was cursed with negative communication: everyone thought the plan would be hell. So at the start people stayed away from the city, but things have now balanced out. Ine, A city where you can hear people walking and talking mixed with the quiet zoom of bikes is such a vast improvement over the incessant noise of cars. One really has to drive along the Coupure  at rush hour to appreciate it in full. Thousands of people on their bikes on the busiest road and yet there is a certain calm to it. Businesses are flourishing and the city didn’t die like many naysayers predicted. The whole thing is awesome. If your city is planning to do the same my only advice is: don’t listen to the haters. Manu Joye, 41, IT manager, The expanded area has made it much safer for cyclists. Complementary policies have been introduced like the cycle streets which have led people to cycle more. There are also fewer accidents and the city has become quieter to live in. My advice would be to focus on the whole city not just a small area to not disadvantage people who are not able to afford to live in privileged areas. Ghent has established several cycle streets where cars can’t overtake bikes. This, for me, is a very powerful addition to just having restricted areas for cars. Moritz Gallei, 26, university research assistant, It has transformed the grey (but even then exciting town) where I came to study 38 years ago into the lively and diverse city it is now. Living just out of the centre and in the area where cars are still allowed there are positive consequences. As the plan contains a reduction of ‘gates’ you have to use to get to the parking spaces (many of which are in the centre as they were built before the plan was conceived) the through traffic is managed better. Koen De Maeseneir, 56, manager of the federation of community health centres in the city, I have a safer feeling as a cyclist compared to the time before the circulatieplan. The border of each area is now demarcated by ‘knips’. At these points cyclists and pedestrians are king. It’s a big misunderstanding that the city is not accessible anymore – we only got rid of traffic that doesn’t need to be there. If you want to go from point A to B by car, you use the ring road and don’t go through the medieval city centre. That’s logical, isn’t it? If you’re thinking of doing the same, don’t be afraid of change. Stijn, It’s funny to hear people say how it was impossible to get around Ghent and that they couldn’t use their car. For me, living in Leuven, a town with a similar circulation plan, it sounded like people were talking about visiting a war zone. My brother and his family live in Ghent and they got rid of their car because it became obsolete. What stands out most is the silence. Gone was the typical noise of cars. The air also tastes better than in the small towns where traffic is denser than in the city. And then you have the wonderful experiments of ‘living streets’, where people turn their streets into sitting rooms and extra gardens. Without cars there is so much more space in a city. Tine Hens, journalist, Leuven, Before the plan, big parts of the city used to be gridlocked for several hours each day. Although there was already an extensive pedestrian area, many lovely streets were spoiled by queueing cars. Now the city centre is fun to hang around in all day through. The number of cyclists is increasing impressively. Pedestrians are having a good time and most shopkeepers are doing great business. Most people are taking the change for the better for granted already. Lieven Van de Woestyne, 54, teacher, I’m pro circulatieplan and really glad the city introduced it. The city is much more enjoyable than before. Some busy streets were just used as a passing-through by cars, by people who don’t live in the city and who don’t really need to be there. This caused a lot of unnecessary traffic. The city is still perfectly reachable for cars. There was so much negative publicity before its introduction that visitors now think they cannot visit Ghent by car anymore, which is not true. In fact, the car-free zones are just a very small part of the city. My only hope is that they continue to expand it to smaller districts outside the city centre of Ghent (eg Muide, Brugse Poort, Bloemekenswijk). If you’re thinking about doing the same, just go for it! Jolien, The inner city is a dream to walk and cycle in since there are barely any cars except for some taxis. Most of the cars that do drive in the inner city also drive a lot slower than they used to. Personally I feel like the streets are more alive as they aren’t just for cars anymore. More people put their chairs out in the summer to sit on the pavement and talk, and some streets become ‘living streets’ where the kids can play outside, skate, and adults hold barbecues.

If officials get their way, the city will be split into zones, and, rather than driving direct, motorists will have to use the ring road for all zone-to-zone journeys., Those travelling by foot and bicycle in the new Brum won’t be inconvenienced: their journeys will be simple and – with fewer cars – safer. With cars out of the way, bus journeys will become swifter and more reliable., The Birmingham transport plan, launched last week, was influenced by Ghent’s zone-centred traffic circulation plan of 2017. This medieval Belgian city – a quarter of the size of Birmingham – demonstrated that it was possible to switch attitudes overnight. Streets were blocked to motorists one Sunday evening and – to the disappointment of the waiting media –there was no wailing, no gnashing of teeth, no gridlock., Motorists have since found that, while their journeys are longer in distance, they take less time because there are fewer fellow travellers on the roads. Motor vehicles used to make up 55% of trips in Ghent – that number has now fallen to 27%., Retailers and restaurants that had warned of Armageddon discovered that takings did not plummet., “Actually the economic situation has improved,” says the Green politician who led what had been controversial changes. Filip Watteeuw, deputy mayor of Ghent, points out there “has been a 17% increase in restaurant and bar startups, and the number of empty shops has been arrested”., A year after the imposition of the traffic circulation plan – in news that may encourage similarly minded politicians around the world, Watteeuw was re-elected with an increased majority., Another advantage of the intervention is that it is remarkably cheap to implement; Ghent’s plan cost just €4m (£3.4m) to implement. By comparison it costs an estimated £20m-£30m to build just one mile of motorway., “A city’s best car plan is a bike plan,” he said. “Providing more space for walking and cycling leads not only to more people walking and cycling, it also makes space for people who really need to use their cars.”, A great deal of Ghent’s traffic congestion was found to have been caused by an excess of short car journeys – as planners had accurately modelled., “We had people complaining that a drive of 300 metres became a car journey of two kilometres,” remembers Watteeuw. “We had to explain that we don’t want people to use a car for 300 metres: they should walk.”, In Birmingham 25% of car journeys are one mile or less. Thanks to new infrastructure, bicycle use in the city is rising but from a pitiful low of just 1% of all trips. Birmingham city council wants this to rise to 5% by 2023, but if it successfully introduces its circulation plan it might be surprised by far greater success. Ghent’s plan had imagined a cycling modal share of 35% by 2030, up from 22% in 2016. Instead, after an explosive 60% rise in cycle use, the target was reached last year, 13 years earlier than planned for., Ghent now has cleaner air: nitrogen oxide levels have dropped by 20% since 2017. It’s also a quieter city. “One resident described me as the best orchestral composer the city has ever had,” said Watteeuw., Before the introduction of Ghent’s circulation plan, all that could be heard was the cacophony of cars, complained the resident, but “now he hears birdsong”, Watteeuw said., “Instead of car noise,” he adds, “people can now hear each other talking and children laughing.”, For Mel Jones, Birmingham city council’s head of transport planning, taming cars can’t come soon enough., “Growth in Birmingham’s population will result in 1.2 million additional daily trips across our highways network by 2031,” she says. “Accommodating all these trips by private car is simply not sustainable.”, Road widening is off the table, she adds. It’s expensive, unpopular – and doesn’t work., “We need to look at ways of keeping the city moving in a sustainable and efficient way,” says Jones., Birmingham plans to remove one of the most significant incentives to motoring: car parking. Businesses will be incentivised to remove parking spaces through the introduction of an annual £500 per space workplace parking levy, and the city will build 12,800 new homes on former car parks. “Valuable land in short supply should be used in the most productive way possible,” the council says in its 36-page plan., “Reducing pressure on kerb space” will “provide improved penetration and accessibility by public transport in the city centre,” promises the plan. “Public transport and cycling provision will be prioritised over car parking provision.”, The “allocation of road space will change away from single occupancy private cars,” the council says, because the priority should be “moving people, not vehicles”., Freight deliveries will be restricted to out-of-hours, and there will be a blanket 20mph speed limit across the city’s local roads., Birmingham must “build a future in which the car will no longer be king”, says Waseem Zaffar, the city council cabinet member for transport and environment., Cars, he adds, are “bad for the health of ourselves and our families, bad for our communities and bad for business as measured by the millions of pounds of lost productivity caused by congestion”., Watteeuw advises Birmingham’s councillors not to stagger any changes., “In Ghent, we implemented the plan as a whole overnight,” he says. “It was technically and politically the easiest way.”, The Birmingham transport plan goes out to public consultation soon. Watteeuw – who received death threats before the implementation of the plan – urges the residents of Birmingham not to allow loud voices and vested interests to derail the process., “Talk to people, but be persistent, and don’t give in on the plan’s principal benefits,” he says.how a belgian port city inspired birminghams car free ambitions", "label": 0}, "train-132": {"text": "\nHumans risk living in an empty world, warns UN biodiversity chief\n, Ahead of the World Economic Forum, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema urges governments to take definitive action on climate, deforestation and pollution, \nPatrick Greenfield, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 02.00 EST\n\n, Humanity will have given up on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems, the United Nation’s new biodiversity chief has warned., Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, has implored governments to ensure 2020 is not just another “year of conferences” on the ongoing ecological destruction of the planet, urging countries to take definitive action on deforestation, pollution and the climate crisis., The warning comes on the eve of the Davos World Economic Forum, where biodiversity loss has been highlighted as the third biggest risk to the world in terms of likelihood and severity this year, ahead of infectious diseases, terror attacks and interstate conflict., The ongoing destruction of life-supporting ecosystems such as coral reefs and rainforests means humans risk living in an “empty world” with “catastrophic” consequences for society, according to Mrema, who is responsible for spearheading a Paris-style agreement for nature that will be negotiated this year., “People’s lives depend on biodiversity in ways that are not always apparent or appreciated. Human health ultimately depends on ecosystem services: the availability of fresh water, fuel, food sources. All these are prerequisites for human health and livelihoods,” she told the Guardian in her first major interview since taking up the role., In May last year, the world’s leading scientists warned that nature is disappearing at a rate tens to hundreds of times higher than the average for the past 10m years. Experts have previously warned that humans are driving the sixth mass extinction event in Earth’s history, cautioning there is a short time to act., “Business, local communities, civil society, the youth, all of us led by governments must take action. We have been talking of action for many years. Really, we need transformative action to make a difference,” Mrema said., Last week, the long-awaited draft of a Paris-style UN agreement on nature was published for the first time, calling for a commitment to protect at least 30% of the planet, controls on invasive species and pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients to be reduced by 50%., The commitments in the draft text, which is expected to be adopted by governments in October at a crucial UN summit in the Chinese city of Kunming, have been kept intentionally modest after the failure of the international agreement on biodiversity conservation made for the previous decade., Some campaigners have criticised the draft agreement, insisting that governments must do more to protect the planet. Mrema said she had hoped negotiators would create something more ambitious than the current proposal., When asked what would happen if governments did not take sufficient action, Mrema said: “The risks will be major. One is that we will not have listened to the science and the evidence provided. Because we will not have listened, it means the global community will have said: let biodiversity loss continue, let people continue to die, let the degradation continue, deforestation continue, pollution continue, and we’ll have given up as an international community to save the planet., “I hope that’s not where any of us would want to be.”, Mrema, who took over the role in November last year after former chief Cristiana Paşca Palmer stepped down, recalled growing up in Tanzania, where her home looked out on Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa., “When I grew up as I child, I could see and hear water flowing in the banana plantations. But now I am an adult, those streams have completely dried. Every time I deal with biodiversity issues, I reflect what I used to see as I grew up and went to school. What I see today, I cannot compare the two. More devastation now, the water is no longer there, the bush, the forest, the entire area is now bare,” she said., The UN has organised a youth summit this April in Miyazaki, Japan, which the organisation hopes environmental activists such as Greta Thunberg will attend., “Being an adult, I can say that we have failed and are failing our children and the youth,” Mrema said., “Our children are asking what climate are they going to inherit from us if the planet they are seeing is polluted. The ocean they are seeing is full of plastic, the forest they are told to be seeing becomes bare land, the consumption patterns are leading to more pollution., “The children know exactly what their rights are, what they want and what they expect from their parents,” she said., “Whatever is negotiated today will affect our children more than us as adults. They want to make sure that the world left to them was not just decided by us but that they were also part of the decision-making process.”, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featureshumans risk living in an empty world warns un biodiversity chief aoe", "label": 0}, "train-133": {"text": "\nCountry diary 1920: is the kingfisher really in danger of extinction?\n, 20 January 1920 In certain districts the kingfisher is no longer to be found, but this is doubtless due to the fact that it cannot find food in polluted waters, \nThomas Coward, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 26 Mar 2020 10.19 EDT\n\n, Owing largely to the unjustifiable and, for the matter of that, illegal persecution of the brightly-coloured kingfisher either for hat decoration or as a household ornament, the status of the bird is misunderstood. It is thought to be in danger of extinction. In certain districts the kingfisher is no longer to be found, but this is doubtless due to the fact that it cannot find food in polluted waters; but in others, those who know its call and recognise it by its shape and flight when no sun lights up its prismatic colours realise that it is more plentiful than we should suppose from the wails of the sentimentalist. It is no use to fight a wrong by exaggeration., The fact that within a week, so I am told, three kingfishers killed themselves by striking a window within the city boundary is interesting. Apart from the light it throws on the numbers of the bird, it raises an interesting question, Why were the three deluded? for deluded they certainly were. Only by seeing that window with an avian eye, and from the position of the approaching kingfisher, could we solve the problem: some trick of light must have given the suggestion of water or an open passage, some reflection on the window glass. Instinct is not infallible, and the bird’s sight, good though it is, sometimes misleads. But the main interest centres in the fact that in an area where the kingfishers are thought to be rare there are actually so many that in a short time three at least reach one particular spot; it is most improbable that these three unfortunates were the only ones about.country diary is kingfisher really in danger of extinction 1920", "label": 0}, "train-134": {"text": "\nCountry diary: in the mist it's easy to imagine long-gone days at the races\n, Lambert’s Castle, Dorset: The hillfort track hasn’t been in use since the 1950s, but legend dates it back to the Romans, \nSara Hudston, \n\nMon 20 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, On a clear day, the views from the hillfort at Lambert’s Castle are so far-reaching that it once hosted an optical telegraph station. During the Napoleonic wars it was part of a chain relaying news from Plymouth to the Admiralty Office in London., But I visit on a day when the place is smothered in pearl-grey cloud and visibility is less than 20 metres. Dripping trees loom and dissolve, rubbing their bare, black branches in the wind. Some birches sport witches’ brooms: malformed clusters of thin twigs like crazy nests of backcombed hair. These virescences are a type of gall, caused by the Taphrina betulina fungus., The modern world is shut off by mist and it’s easy to imagine the past. Nearly 3,000 years ago the hillfort marked the border between the iron age Durotriges tribes to the east and the Dumnonii to the west., From medieval times until the 1950s, the hill was the site of a livestock fair, held twice a year, at midsummer and in September. The highlight was the horse racing on the second day; prizes for the 1845 meeting included “a splendid silver cup” and a purse of sovereigns., By the 20th century, however, the contest had become a rougher lark. Many jockeys rode ponies without saddles, and skulduggery was part of the game. There were tales of substitute horses hidden behind gorse bushes and riders swapping halfway round the course., The racing and the fair finally ended in 1953, when the National Trust acquired the land, though there is still a bridleway across the site and riders sometimes enjoy a canter across the mossy grass., The racecourse is still there, a faint, unassuming track almost three-quarters of a mile long, marked with occasional white posts. It’s not clear how old it is. Local legend links it to the first-century Roman cavalry that was garrisoned five miles away at Waddon Hill., Walking the course in the mist, I think of all those generations of horses, white-eyed with excitement, flinging themselves over the grass. I look down and there, on a soft stretch, are the prints of a single horse, galloping north.country diary mist hillfort traces horse races", "label": 0}, "train-135": {"text": "\nMore than 100 threatened species hit hard by Australian bushfires, pushing many towards extinction\n, Nearly 50 threatened species believed to have had more than 80% of their area affected, including seven critically endangered plants, \nAdam Morton Environment editor, \n\nSun 19 Jan 2020 20.15 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 19 Jan 2020 22.28 EST\n\n, Nearly 50 nationally threatened animal and plant species are believed to have had at least 80% of the area in which they live affected by bushfire, a federal environment department analysis has found., Another 65 have had more than half their area in the fire zone. Scientists have warned some affected species could be pushed to extinction., The worst affected mammal is believed to be the Kangaroo Island dunnart, an endangered mouse-like marsupial endemic to the 160km long South Australian island., It is one of 49 species, including 47 plants and one spider, that have had at least 80% of their likely and known range within fire-hit areas. Seven of the plant species, including the nightcap oak and three types of leek orchid, are critically endangered., Species believed to have had at least half and up to 80% of their living area affected include the endangered long-footed potoroo in New South Wales and Victoria, the glossy black-cockatoo in South Australia, the Blue Mountains water skink, the rufous scrub-bird and three critically endangered turtles., They are among 331 threatened and migratory species that are believed to have had more than 10% of where they live in burned areas across all six states. The list includes 272 species of plant, 16 mammals, 14 frogs, nine birds, seven reptiles, four insects, four fish and one spider., John Woinarski, professor of conservation biology at Charles Darwin University, said: “This gives us grave concern about the conservation of many threatened species in Australia.”, He said it was too early to call extinctions, but that many species had almost all the entire area of their population burned., “It is all the more reason that we need urgent and sustained action to recover these species,” Woinarski said. “The emergency board is full and over-flowing.”, The analysis includes a special note on the koala, which has been the focus of local and international concern about the impact of the fires on wildlife., About 12% of koala range in NSW, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory – the three jurisdictions in which it is listed as vulnerable – is believed to have been affected by fires. Koalas also live in South Australia and Victoria, but are not listed in those states., The threatened species commissioner, Sally Box, said the results were just the first step in understanding the damage wrought by the bushfire crisis, and that the list would be refined., She said some species on the list were likely to have been worse affected than others, giving the example of the critically endangered Wollemi pine, or “dinosaur tree”. The last known natural stand of Wollemi pine is in the fire zone and it appears on the list, but the NSW government last week announced it had been saved by firefighters., “Some species are more vulnerable to fire than others and some areas were more severely burned than others, so further analysis will be needed before we can fully assess the impact of the fires on the ground,” Box said. “Already we are seeing positive examples of threatened species having survived the fires.”, The desktop analysis compared maps of areas burned between August and 13 January with distribution maps of species listed under national environment laws. Box said it would help decide where $50m in initial federal wildlife recovery funding was spent., The department said some species included in the list might live near, but not in, the areas affected by the fires. Others might have had a larger proportion of the range burned than the preliminary analysis suggested. The analysis gave the example of the western ground parrot as a species that might be worse affected than first thought., It warned that some species not currently listed as threatened would have had their range affected by fire and might now qualify as threatened. The department would be “considering assessments of these species in the near future”., Woinarski, a member of an expert panel of scientists working with Box on wildlife recovery but not speaking in that capacity, stressed fire response would vary between species, with some plants thriving while others did not cope., He said the response to the fires needed to include development of better models showing the distribution of species and rapid on-ground inspections. He said examining the impact on wildlife not already listed as threatened was urgent., “Many of those species may now be seriously imperilled,” he said., Conservation groups have called on the government to use an ongoing review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, led by the businessman Graeme Samuel, to boost wildlife protection in the wake of the bushfires., Hundreds of scientists last year warned the laws needed to be strengthened to help address what was already a worsening extinction crisis.more than 100 threatened species australian bushfires towards extinction", "label": 0}, "train-136": {"text": "\nSpecieswatch: wet winter is good news for the common frog\n, Britain’s most recognisable amphibian has had a rough few years because of dry winters, \nPaul Brown, \n\nTue 21 Jan 2020 16.30 EST\n\n, The copious rain all over the UK this winter is good news for the common frog (Rana temporaria). Our most seen and recognisable amphibian has had a rough couple of years, at least in the south, because dry winters and warm early summer weather dried up many of its natural breeding sites leaving tadpoles stranded. The frog is still relatively common only because it has moved into urban areas and breeds readily in garden ponds. Out in the country, the combination of farmers filling in ponds and poisoning ditches and other breeding places by overusing fertiliser and pesticides means that many cereal-growing areas are now without frogs at all., The species started breeding in the far south-west this month and, as the weather warms, their spawn can be found during February and March gradually spreading further east and north. The timing of the rush to the breeding ponds is driven by warmth, so the climate crisis and mild winters have moved this process forward by as much as three to four weeks since 1990. The warming has also confused frogs. They once seemed to have a common signal about when to arrive at a particular pond.

But with 600 million people without access to an electricity grid, there is huge potential for future investment., A report by Kleos Advisory, published during the first UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, has found that the commercial opportunity from off-grid solar panels could generate about $24bn (£18bn) a year., The market is growing rapidly since the collapse in the cost of solar panel technologies and the emergence of mobile banking and affordable financing in the continent’s fast-growing economies., Households that earn an income are increasingly using mobile phones to rent small-scale solar panels, and ultra-efficient electric lighting strips and appliances to access electricity for the first time., Once the solar panels are paid off, households own the equipment outright and in effect have free energy. Many then choose to upgrade their packages to add televisions and electric cookers., The off-grid solar market is expected to grow rapidly, in part because eight of the world’s 15 fastest-growing economies are in Africa., Tedd George, the author of the report, said the combination of solar technology and affordable financing was “driving an economic transformation in Africa, making the ‘unbankable’ bankable and embedding African consumers in the digital economy”., UK companies including Azuri Technologies, which commissioned the report, and Bboxx are racing to corner the market for off-grid solar in Africa with the help of private investment and major international companies., Azuri sells its home solar systems in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Nigeria, and Bboxx is active in Kenya, Togo, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria., The scale of the off-grid solar market across Africa has emerged as UK investment leaders consider future investment in the continent after Brexit., Tony Blair said the summit this week “should open a new chapter in Britain’s relationship with Africa” to one based on “economic cooperation rather than simply an aid-based, donor-recipient relationship”., The former Labour prime minister said: “If we can use the UK-Africa Investment Summit to become a true economic partner to African countries, it would be of great strategic benefit to the continent and to the UK.”uk africa off grid solar power", "label": 0}, "train-139": {"text": "\nGreyhound warns staff they could be 'in the crossfire' over Adani contract\n, Exclusive: anti-Adani campaigners may protest bus company’s involvement in controversial mine, email tells workers, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nTue 21 Jan 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 07.32 EDT\n\n, The boss of the Australian bus company Greyhound has warned its workers they could be caught “in the crossfire” after signing a contract to help build the Adani coal project in Queensland., The email from the chief executive, Alex de Waal, seen by Guardian Australia, asked staff not to “undermine your colleagues or brand” by sharing internal updates or posting to social media., Before the 6 January email, Greyhound had not been linked to the Adani project and the company told Guardian Australia it had not been targeted by protesters., The email revealed the company, which has more than 600 staff, had won a three-month contract “with an opportunity for extension” with the construction firm BMD, which is building the mine’s railway from the Galilee Basin to Abbot Point., “The project may create concerns to individual team members in light of the international political, environmental, social and economic debate about climate change underway in the media,” the message read., Greyhound is a widely recognised Australian brand that says it carries 5 million passengers more than 38m kilometres a year. The company actively promotes bus travel as a less emissions intensive alternative to flying and driving private cars., Construction work has begun on the Indian-owned Adani mine – one of the most controversial fossil fuel projects in Australia’s history, which will extract coal for export to power stations., “Servicing BMD is not Greyhound taking a stand on climate change or any other important environmental topic facing our nation and the world,” the email said., “Greyhound could become one of many companies in the crossfire of the anti-Adani campaign,” De Waal said in the email. “Thank you for being courageous in servicing the regions and customers that mean so much to our business.”, Staff in Townsville, Emerald, Clermont, Belyando Crossing and Mackay would “play a role” in transferring workers, the email said., “You are entitled to your views and we respect them,” it said., Employees were asked to “utilise the internal communication channels rather than discussing sensitive business matters with external parties”., In a Q&amp;A section of the email, the company told staff it had “decided to be courageous” in taking the contract., Instructions were provided to staff “if you are approached by media or protestors”, asking them to “stay calm”, to refer people to Greyhound’s head office, and then to “walk away and go to a place of safety” before contacting a manager “immediately”., Defending the company’s environmental credentials, the email said the company wanted to “transition to electric vehicles on reef routes”., The email noted that De Waal is the chairman of the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a conservation group led by Andy Ridley, a co-founder of Earth Hour, and promoted by Alan Jones at its launch in 2016. Ridley joined as chief executive in 2017 and relaunched the project with “the climate crisis as a focus”., The email said the company was the foundation’s “eco-friendly travel partner” and more than $40,000 had been raised for the foundation by offering customers the option of an extra dollar cost on their tickets., Ridley told Guardian Australia the foundation was “not aware” of Greyhound’s contract with BMD., He said: “We have a clear ethical charter and for Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef – it’s critically important that we follow that charter. I need to look and check this immediately.”, Guardian Australia has also seen a report prepared by a public relations company advising Greyhound on how it should handle its association with BMD and the Adani mine., The report included the text of the email written by De Waal, saying “Greyhound Australia must be conscious this update could be forwarded to activists and the media”., The company’s messages should have “three pillars” that refer to supporting local employment, “delivering environmentally friendly and safe services” and “supporting regional communities”, the report said., Several major companies associated with the controversial coalmine have been targeted by campaigners., Billie Tristram, 14, is a climate change campaigner who has helped organise school strike marches in Townsville., “We travel to school camps using Greyhound buses – a lot of schools use them. Greyhound is putting economics first instead of the environment. It’s like a slap in the face. I won’t be travelling with them until they back out.”, In January, the German technology company Siemens said it would honour its Adani contract after carrying out a review., In December, the engineering firm GHD ended a 10-year association with Adani after that company was also targeted by campaigners., Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, a group that tracks the relationships between corporations and fossil fuel industries, said Greyhound was now being placed on its “Adani list” of contractors associated with the mine., He said the company’s email suggested it was aware of the “reputational risk” of being associated with the project., “This is not to let any other fossil fuel projects off the hook, but we are drawing a line in the sand on Adani.”, In a statement, Greyhound verified the email and its contents, and said its Greyhound Resources business had been operating for more than 10 years in Queensland’s Bowen basin and in Gladstone., “Greyhound’s work in the resources sector reduces companies’ overall carbon footprint,” the statement said., The company said it had not yet been targeted by anti-Adani campaigners., “We want our team to be safe and secure while delivering a transport solution that takes light vehicles off the road and provides safe transfers for workers from towns and cities to camps and site.”, Asked if the company anticipated criticism from young people who used their services, the statement said: “All generations can make appropriate ethical choices in contributing to lessoning their carbon footprint on this planet., “Greyhound is not only a comfortable and scenic way to travel, it is the most carbon efficient per person for long distances.

They give us oxygen, take away CO2, provide nests for birds and habitats for wildlife, protect against flooding and even help to clean up lung-shredding air pollutants from traffic., As the world’s forests come under increasing threat from fires, agriculture and logging, the World Economic Forum-led initiative to ensure 1tn trees are restored, saved from loss or better protected by 2050 has gathered international support. Now Donald Trump is onboard too, he told Davos., Exactly what Trump’s support amounts to in practical terms is unclear. Will he restore the protected lands that he opened up for commercial development, the biggest reduction in public lands in US history? Reverse his push for logging in the Alaskan Tongass National Forest? Bring back the jobs cut from the US Forest Service? Will he lean on his ally Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil to stop the burning of the Amazon?, Or will he just sign up to a snappy feel-good headline? Because who, after all, doesn’t like trees?, WEF is launching its 1T.org initiative at Davos on Wednesday, aiming to use the restoration of nature to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises. It is estimated that the planet is losing 10bn trees a year, and large-scale projects to restore and replant forests are needed., To make a real impact, however, tree fans must take on some of the biggest vested interests on the planet. Fossil fuel businesses are rightly regarded as the main culprits in rising global emissions, but the food we eat, clothes we wear and stuff we use takes a heavy toll on the world’s forests and peatlands, and therefore the planet’s ability to absorb carbon, as well as devastating species loss. Corporate commodity supply chains are responsible for about four-fifths of the loss of tropical forests across Asia, South America and sub-Saharan Africa., The big question for tree supporters is whether they are willing to address the root causes of deforestation as well as replanting degraded areas, and whether they can couple this with the massive reduction in carbon emissions required from energy, transport and industry. As Greta Thunberg responded at Davos: “Planting trees is very good of course, but it is nowhere near enough.”, Trump’s own record on environmental issues does not suggest a willingness to take on those vested interests, and his withdrawal from the UN’s Paris climate agreement – which pledges to keep global heating below 2C, and 1.5C if possible, and for the first time requires all nations to make a contribution to curbing emissions – is the most climate-wrecking of all his international moves., As giant redwoods that have stood for millennia topple over in California as a direct result of the climate crisis, we should remember that replanting them is not an option. If Trump wants to protect them, he will need to address the US role in the climate crisis – and that starts with meeting the Paris goals, not running from them.trump hails 1tn trees plan but ignores roots of problem", "label": 0}, "train-141": {"text": "\nWriters and scientists celebrate UK's 67 most endangered birds\n, \nWriters and scientists celebrate UK's 67 most endangered birds\n, Book aims to raise awareness of conservation – and some much-needed funding , \nPhoebe Weston, \n\nTue 21 Jan 2020 08.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 22 Jan 2020 07.30 EST\n\n, From stories about capercaillies strutting around like “cocksure” hedge fund managers to corn buntings shrieking like old fruit sellers, Britain’s nature writers, artists and scientists have flocked together to create an illustrated book celebrating 67 of the country’s most endangered birds., Red Sixty Seven is an elegy to the growing number of British birds on the “red list” of highly vulnerable species drawn up by conservation scientists for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)., Guardian country diarist Mark Cocker describes grey partridges as part of the “soundtrack of childhood”, while nature writer Mary Colwell says she would “weep for a thousand years” if curlews went extinct as breeding birds in Britain., Other contributors include presenter Chris Packham advocating for the long-tailed duck, novelist Melissa Harrison tapping out words for the lesser spotted woodpecker, musician Fyfe Dangerfield praising the dotterel, as well as contributions from teenage conservationists Bella Lack and Mya-Rose Craig, and Guardian writer Patrick Barkham. Proceeds from the book, which is published by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), will go towards the work of the BTO and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and their efforts to save these species from extinction, with the book’s artwork also raffled to raise money., “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers, but the silent, still ground of Swallow Moss tells another story – of a nation that’s failed to manage its land for all of its inhabitants,” writes former leader of the Green Party Natalie Bennett in her piece about the uncertain future of the black grouse, once common on Staffordshire moors., In the book, Mark Eaton from the RSPB draws attention to the funding gap in conservation., Public sector spending on biodiversity in the UK has fallen by 42% as a proportion of GDP since 2008/09. And yet NGOs have increased their spending on it by 20% in the past five years, raising money from an increasingly concerned public, says Eaton., “The football team I support has an annual turnover bigger than the total spent by UK and devolved governments on conservation. It’s not just governments: as a society, we don’t place sufficient significance upon our natural world,” he says., But thanks to dedicated conservation action, ringed plover, bittern, nightjar, stone-curlew, woodlark, marsh harrier and red kite populations have recovered in recent years and are no longer listed as vulnerable. “Whilst the red list continues to grow, these species demonstrate that we do know how to turn things around: if only we had the resources,” says Eaton., The book is about hope and discovery as well as nostalgia for a wilder past. Conservationist Tim Mackrill writes about the white-tailed eagle returning to the Solent after an absence of more than two centuries, saying thousands of people can now “marvel at the sight of this most iconic of birds”. David Lindo, known as the Urban Birder, describes his delight at seeing redstarts popping up in unusual places such as building sites in Wapping, east London, shopping centres in Manchester and perimeter walls in Dungeness, Kent., Artworks include pieces by Daily Mail political cartoonist Paul Thomas and painter Carry Akroyd., “This book is really about bringing birds to life for people. When species become rare, people don’t see them or have the opportunity to connect with them,” said Mike Toms, head of communications at BTO. “To have people writing about the way these birds have influenced them is really special.

They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down., We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. , Jeroen Dewulf, a veterinarian at Ghent University in Belgium, said the introduction of the African swine fever virus (ASF) into Belgium had almost certainly been caused by human interference: either through imported contaminated animal products or by illegal movements of wild boar., “There are several drivers of spreading diseases, but live animals are the largest source of infection,” Dewulf said. “The more you are going to move animals, the more you run the risk that diseases will be spread through these animals. There are other routes, the virus can be transmitted in meat products for example, but it’s much more efficient to transmit via live animals.”,  David McIver, a senior scientist and epidemiologist at biotech company Metabiota, said the rise in live animal exports was a growing issue for many other diseases, such as avian influenza virus, mad cow disease and Nipah virus, while he warned that ASF could one day feasibly threaten humans in some form., “The first case of Nipah virus in 1998 came after an outbreak in Malaysia following the expansion of pig farming in pristine rainforest areas,” he said., “Bats were eating fruit, they dropped it with their saliva on it, it was eaten by pigs, then it gets into humans and there were 105 deaths. Tons of swine had to be culled to get the outbreak under control. If we’re exporting those animals around the world we’re potentially moving unknown pathogens to new places.”, In another well-known case, British live cattle exports, as well as those of beef products, were banned in the 1990s due to the fear of spreading bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease., It is believed that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare, fatal brain disorder, is likely to be caused by people ingesting meat contaminated with mad cow disease., The authors of a study in journal BioMed warned in 2015: “Animal trade is an effective way of introducing, maintaining and spreading animal diseases, as observed with the spread of different strains of foot and mouth disease in Africa, the Middle East and Asia and the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), for example, into Oman and Canada through the importation of infected cattle.”, McIver added: “Even though ASF doesn’t affect humans now, pigs and people are not so different biologically and immunologically, so it is conceivable that a few small changes in the genetics of the virus can allow that to hop into people and then we’ve got ourselves a serious problem.”, Prof Dirk Pfeiffer, from City University in Hong Kong and the Royal Veterinary College in London, said the risk depends on where you are in the world. “It’s very regulated in high-income countries with fairly effective measures in place protecting their livestock populations from spread of infectious diseases,” he said., “The real issue is in many of the low- to medium-income countries where there are new opportunities for money to be made, and that includes increased meat demand. Movements of live animals in these parts of the world play a role in spreading animal disease.” In China, for example, live animals are regularly moved around the country in order to supply the ‘wet markets’ where butchers serve up freshly slaughtered meat. These places have long been connected with disease risk – and, indeed, the recent outbreak of coronavirus has been traced back to a wet market in Wuhan., One of the perverse incentives of the surveillance system is the harder you research the more likely you’ll find something, A system managed by the World Organisation for Animal Health monitors disease outbreaks and provides information based on the reporting of affected countries. While it is praised for its role, it has to rely on prompt and honest reporting from states to be fully effective., “One of the perverse incentives about the surveillance system is that the harder you research the more likely you’ll find something, and then the country will be a victim of finding something,” Dewulf said., “In Belgium, for example, with the recent ASF outbreak, we were carefully monitoring, we notified all the responsible agencies, and then we faced all the consequences, such as trade restrictions, etc. In consequence, our animal industry has been hit very hard.”, But despite the growing realisation of the need to control exports more robustly, experts warn that it would be impossible to screen all animals., “In most cases where we look at the transmission of disease, whether in humans or livestock, we tend to see them move quicker and in more diverse ways than our surveillance systems are able to keep up with,” McIver said., Nor are these systems designed to screen live animals or meat products entering or leaving countries, he said, before warning of diseases which have not yet been identified., “Due to the sheer volume of animals that move around, the budgets that are allocated towards it are not always sufficient and in many cases we’re only able to look for things we know about. Animals may be coming or going with pathogens that are potentially really dangerous but we just haven’t dealt with them yet.”, • This article was amended on 22 January 2020 to make clear that it is specifically variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) that is linked to people consuming meat contaminated with mad cow disease.

Countries are supposed to notify the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), which will then place restrictions on their trade., Sudanese government ministers admit it was a difficult decision to send the notification, knowing that it would have profound economic effects. The outbreak has now been declared over., This week the Guardian’s Animals Farmed series is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled over the last fifty years., Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks. , Every day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals. , And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down., We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. , Live animals are one of Sudan’s most important exports, bringing in approximately $500 million (£384,620) in 2018, according to the International Trade Centre., But in September last year, Sudan informed the OIE that Rift Valley fever had found its way into the country. In October Saudi Arabia, which buys more than 70% of its livestock from Sudan, announced a ban on imports., The ban had a devastating effect on farmers and exporters, who were forced in some cases to sell their animals at half the usual price., Siddiq Hedob, a member of an independent livestock exporters’ body in Khartoum, estimated that about 30% of the exporters in Sudan “have lost money”., “When the minister of health announced the decision, there were about 80,000 sheep at Port Sudan waiting to be transferred to Saudi but it didn’t happen, even though they were all healthy,” Hedob said. “So they spent about four days without food or drinking water and many of them had died and were thrown in the sea.” However, other sources denied that animals had been disposed of in the water., Exporter Abdelrahman El-Shaeekh said thousands of his cattle were being kept in Omdurman city, which was costing him a lot of money. He did not know when exactly they could be sent off to Saudi Arabia., “I have 6,000 sheep and I had to keep them in Omdurman. Each cost me 40 Sudanese pound (£0.70) a day for food and drink, apart from what I pay for the vet,” he said., Rift Valley fever is a disease that affects both humans and animals: it is transmitted by mosquito and leads to miscarriage and sometimes death in animals. A vaccine for both humans and animals exists., The disease has been moving across east Africa for the last couple of years and the World Health Organization has been among the agencies monitoring its progress and warning of possible economic impacts., A Sudanese government official said notifying the OIE had been the correct decision., Minister of Health Dr Akram Altoum told the Guardian: “When I first consulted the minister of finance, foreign minister, animal resources minister, trade and the industry, and the local governments, we agreed that yes this is painful, but please go ahead and declare. We felt it had to happen, it’s a principle.”, “It would cost our economy thousands of dollars and a whole market of exports, but we had to do it. We didn’t do it with any expectations of reward, but it came with its own reward. We collaborated with countries like Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council and they helped to control the disease. Thanks to the vaccine and the technical support they gave us … it will be behind us.”, It is believed that other countries have been less rigorous about notifying the authorities about suspected outbreaks. Questions have long been asked about the mysterious absence of African swine fever from Belarus, for example, which is entirely surrounded by countries that have suffered severe epidemics.it was painful to declare it outbreak of animal disease was blow to sudan exports", "label": 0}, "train-144": {"text": "\nStudy finds shock rise in levels of potent greenhouse gas\n, Scientists had expected fall in levels of HFC-23 after India and China said they had halted emissions, \nMatthew Taylor, \n\nTue 21 Jan 2020 05.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 06.35 EST\n\n, Efforts to reduce levels of one potent greenhouse gas appear to be failing, according to a study., Scientists had expected to find a dramatic reduction in levels of the hydrofluorocarbon HFC-23 in the atmosphere after India and China, two of the main sources, reported in 2017 that they had almost completely eliminated emissions., But a paper published in the journal Nature Communications says that by 2018 concentrations of the gas – used in fridges and air conditioners – had not fallen but were increasing at a record rate., Matt Rigby, from Bristol University, who co-authored the study and is a member of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment, said academics had hoped to see a big reduction following the reports from India and China., “This potent greenhouse gas has been growing rapidly in the atmosphere for decades now, and these reports suggested that the rise should have almost completely stopped in the space of two or three years. This would have been a big win for climate.”, Scientists say the fact they found emissions had risen is a puzzle and could have implications for the Montreal protocol, an international treaty that was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer., Kieran Stanley, the lead author of the study, said that although China and India were not yet bound by the agreement, their reported reduction would have put them on course to be consistent with it., “Our study finds that it is very likely that China has not been as successful in reducing HFC-23 emissions as reported,” he said. “However, without additional measurements, we can’t be sure whether India has been able to implement its abatement programme.”, HFCs were hailed as an answer to the hole in the ozone layer that appeared over Antarctica in the 1980s because they replaced hundreds of chemical substances widely used in aerosols that depleted the thin layer of ozone that protects Earth from harmful rays from the sun., But in recent years there has been mounting concern at how the potent greenhouse gas was undermining efforts to keep global heating below dangerous levels. Scientists say one tonne of HFC-23 emissions is equivalent to the release of more than 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide., Experts estimate that had the HFC-23 emissions reductions been as large as reported, the equivalent of a year’s worth of Spain’s CO2 emissions would have been avoided between 2015 and 2017., • This article was amended on 6 February 2020 because HFC-23 is not used in inhalers, as an earlier version wrongly said.

Financial and economic concerns have been shunted down the list of priorities in favour of five environmental issues: climate breakdown and extreme weather; failure to mitigate or adapt to climate change; human-made pollution; biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions., Green campaigners and social and human rights activists have been raising concerns on all of these for more than two decades, but it seems that finally the world’s powers are paying attention. In some cases it may be too late to act to avoid the consequences of the delay in taking action., Since 2015 when the landmark Paris agreement was signed, greenhouse gas emissions have risen a further 4% and although there are signs the rate of increase may be slowing, that is nowhere near enough. Oceans are at the hottest ever recorded., Last year, ecological scientists said 1 million species were on the brink of extinction. The biomass of wild animals on the planet has fallen by more than 80%, about half of the area of key natural ecosystems has been lost, and insect populations have crashed, according to the report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services., The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2018 that by 2030 the world must be on track or exceeding 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels would be all but inevitable. Warming has already topped 1C and 2019 was the second hottest year on record., As the Davos agenda shows, businesses are taking note. Ashim Paun, the global co-head of environmental, social, and governance research at HSBC, said: “Will 2020 be an inflexion point? Our investor clients increasingly think climate change is absolutely core to their investment processes. So this year we look to major political and policy developments – the details of the EU green deal in March, the outcome of elections, particularly the US where we see the outcome as fairly binary for climate, and whether this year’s climate talks in Glasgow in November can regain previous momentum.”, There is plenty that all people around the world can do to get involved and shape the direction of this crunch decade. “2019 proved that activism works,” said Richard George, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace. “The amazing contributions from the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion, along with many others, got us a net zero target in the UK and other countries, and almost universal agreement that not only is climate change happening but action to stop it is both vital and urgent. What we need now is real action to get the carbon out of our energy, transport, food and finance sectors, which means turning up the heat on politicians and corporations. This is the year to do it.”, There will be international conferences this year on the climate, the oceans, biodiversity, deforestation and a host of other pressing environmental concerns. Many targets and deadlines for taking action are pegged to 2020, and governments and businesses will have to answer for any failure to meet those goals. The world is changing and leaders in all spheres are recognising that people are no longer willing to passively accept environmental destruction., Here’s what to look out for in 2020., Nearly five years have passed since the signing of the Paris agreement pledging to prevent global heating of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Since then, progress has stalled. Last year’s UN climate conference in Madrid ended inconclusively with no agreement on some basic aspects of implementing Paris. More importantly, countries’ commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 accord are inadequate to stay within the 2C limit and would lead to a disastrous 3C rise., That makes this year’s climate summit the biggest since Paris. Governments must come to COP26 in Glasgow in November armed with new emissions targets commensurate to the risk of climate breakdown. If Donald Trump is still in power, other countries must press ahead without the US and face down challenges to the Paris accord from Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. That will be a massive struggle, and strong clear messages from civil society will be vital to its success., Trump has blasted through federal protections ranging from clean air and water to Alaskan drilling and pipeline construction, and if he wins a second term he is likely to continue on that track. In international terms his influence has been baleful on climate action: he started the formal process to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, and that decision that will come into effect the day after the presidential election on 3 November. COP26 begins on 9 November and the US delegation will be drawn from the Trump White House whatever the election outcome. British diplomats will be looking to use the supposedly friendly relationship between Trump and Boris Johnson to try to ensure the US does not play a disruptive role., Trump will also preside over the G7 meeting in June, which means environmental issues will be off the agenda. In some previous years, notably 2005-07, the then G8’s focus on the climate proved a valuable spur to progress in the UN climate talks. This year that will be missing., Plastic pollution, overfishing, overheating and acidification from climate change are driving a crisis in the oceans. The World Ocean Summit in early March in Tokyo will set out the latest science on ocean health and present possible solutions. Later that month, from 23 March to 3 April, comes the final scheduled meeting of the UN effort to draft a new global treaty on the seas. IGC4 aims to set out a new legally binding instrument on “the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”., Ecosystems around the world, from the Amazon to the Antarctic, are on the verge of collapse owing to human encroachment and exploitation, pollution, water scarcity and the impacts of global heating. , Two meetings will focus attention on the loss of biodiversity and ways to stem further destruction. The World Conservation Congress in mid-June in Marseille is a four-yearly meeting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organisation that compiles the global red lists of endangered and threatened species., A series of meetings held under the UN convention on biological diversity will culminate in a meeting at Kunming, China, in October where progress – or the lack of it – on protecting wildlife and plants will be assessed. The current global biodiversity action plan runs from 2011 to 2020 and its key aims are likely to be missed. A new action plan for the next decade should be adopted at the Kunming conference., The Paris agreement was not the only major international achievement of 2015: there was also the signing of the UN sustainable development goals, a set of 17 plans to remedy social and environmental ills – including eliminating poverty and hunger, empowering women and girls, improving access to healthcare and education in developing countries, and providing access to clean water and sanitation. Most of the goals are pegged to 2030, and this year is a staging post to assess progress at the UN high-level political forum in New York in July., The last few years have seen a new wave of environmental activism targeting businesses, whether through divestment campaigns aimed at fossil fuel investors, arts sponsorship deals or direct action. That is likely to increase in 2020 as the impact has become clearer. BlackRock made an unprecedented decision last week to start stepping out of investments with a high climate risk, and other funds will come under pressure to follow suit. There are a variety of ways people can make their views known to company boards, from questioning their pension funds to joining protests or even becoming a shareholder., Globalisation has led to a massive increase in carbon from shipping, which now represents 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but will reach 17% by 2050 if unchecked. But shipping has been deliberately excluded from UN climate negotiations and little progress has been made in the last two decades on cutting greenhouse gases from one of the dirtiest forms of transport. At the International Maritime Organisation meeting in March in London, countries are supposed to come up with a new way forward to fulfil the UN agency’s aims of halving shipping emissions by mid-century – a goal that campaigners say is still inadequate. Last year Extinction Rebellion led effective protests. This year, decisions deferred last year will come back to the agenda., In 2010, companies from around the world joined forces on a target to banish deforestation for palm oil from their supply chains permanently by 2020. That target looks far from being met, but at the Consumer Goods Forum in June in London the signatory companies will have to explain their progress and what they hope to do to improve their performance. Palm oil is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation, particularly in south-east Asia where wildlife ranging from the orangutan to the Sumatran elephant and rhino are being endangered. Consumers have the chance to make their views felt: nobody wants their grocery shopping to contribute to species loss, and there are ways to grow natural resources without causing ecological disaster. It is up to producer companies and retailers to make the difference., The new European commission took office in Brussels late last year with one central promise: a green deal for Europe, by which the whole of the European economy and EU regulations would be overhauled to put environmental protections at the heart of continued prosperity. Clean energy, transport and industry will create new green jobs to replace those lost in polluting industries, and citizens will enjoy cleaner air, water, a healthier natural environment and a stable climate. That is the goal, at least. Living up to that promise will involve hard choices and skilful diplomacy, and in the course of this year the European commission, member states and EU parliament will face a series of key votes and decisions., The EU will also play a leading role in COP26, and the EU-China summit pegged for mid-September in Leipzig in Germany will be key. With the US rejecting the Paris agreement, cooperation between the world’s other biggest emitters will be vital, so the EU must forge a partnership with China or face failure at COP26.oceans biodiversity deforestation whats on the climate agenda for 2020", "label": 0}, "train-146": {"text": "\nCountry diary: the little bird that hides in plain sight\n, Buxton, Derbyshire: Bramblings appear anywhere with trees, even in towns and big cities – yet few Britons ever observe them, \nMark Cocker, \n\nTue 21 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 21 Jan 2020 15.16 EST\n\n, Bramblings are probably among the commonest birds that most Britons have never knowingly seen. Fringilla montifringilla is the chaffinch equivalent that’s found across the boreal forests of northern Eurasia, but here they appear only in winter, visiting almost anywhere with trees, frequently in towns and even big cities, and routinely at birdfeeders., Beechmast is a key part of their diet and at Lightwood there are currently about 500 bramblings scattered across the high canopy. The flock is hypervigilant and edgy, so that no single bird is in view for any length of time. Small groups repeatedly take short downward flights on a trajectory that makes them seem as if they’re skiing between the branches. Then up they surge back to the tops. Occasionally one tree inexplicably gathers them in and they’ll sit there en masse, glowing but restlessly rearranging position, like strangely animate tree decorations., The male’s front and shoulders are sunset orange, and his head is blackish. All bramblings have undersides of linen white that can gleam silver in sharp light. Their backs are brindled pinky brown, with two black-and-white slashes over the wings. The other compelling detail is a pure-white rump, and as a flock departs it will present as a galaxy of snowy spheres that all flash as they vanish into the dark chaos of the treescape. A final key element in the pleasure of brambling flocks are their calls, especially a minute, repeated djup in flight, then a longer zweejj that sounds like wet sponge on rubber., The brambling’s beak is yellowish pink and pointed like tweezer tips, which it uses to extract beech seeds from their spiny cases. Here the birds are feeding in a way I’ve never observed before, peeling off strips of moss and lichen from the branches of the sycamores. Presumably they are in search of arthropods, but in aggregate the technique sends down a drizzle of plant fragments. But moss stripping is a business that holds them barely a minute, and off they swirl as one, amid fresh squalls of buzzy notes, the sudden sleet of their white rumps and a faint susurration composed by a thousand small wings.country diary the little bird that hides in plain sight", "label": 0}, "train-147": {"text": "\nNon-violent groups on UK counter-terror list threaten legal action\n, Animal Aid, CND and Extinction Rebellion among those saying rights violated, \nVikram Dodd and \nJamie Grierson, \n\nWed 22 Jan 2020 14.43 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Wed 22 Jan 2020 09.29 EST\n\n, Peaceful protest groups listed in a counter-terrorism guide used as part of anti-extremism briefings are threatening legal action unless it is withdrawn., The Guardian revealed on Friday that Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups were listed alongside neo-Nazis in the document used as part of training for Prevent, the anti-radicalisation scheme designed to catch those at risk of committing terrorist violence., The guide, from June 2019, bears the logo “Counter Terrorism Policing” on every page, and was presented in briefings to public sector workers such as medical staff and teachers. Police said the document was provided to Prevent partners as “a guide to help them identify and understand the range of organisations they might come across”., The groups listed say their rights have been violated and their inclusion in the guidance is “unlawful” and open to legal challenge., The groups behind the legal threat include Animal Aid, Palestine Solidarity Campaign, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and Extinction Rebellion., The letter sent by solicitors acting for the groups says: “Our clients are non-violent organisations focused on lawful protest and engagement to pursue their legitimate aims., “Their inclusion in a Counter Terrorism Policing document, and the inference that they are involved in unlawful activities, and the targeting of their members and/or activists for referral … plainly amount to an unlawful interference with the rights of their members and/or activists.”, The groups, via their solicitors Bindmans, say they want the guidance withdrawn and an apology issued., Police so far have stood by their actions. “Our focus is definitely not on lawful protest, or legitimate causes taken up by activists across the country,” Counter Terrorism Policing’s senior national coordinator, deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, said last week., A fortnight ago, police said they were recalling a separate document that listed Extinction Rebellion (XR), the climate emergency activist group, as extremist alongside banned far-right groups and an Islamist group linked to violence., On Wednesday, the security minister told parliament the government does not consider Extinction Rebellion to be an extremist organisation., Brandon Lewis was forced to clarify the government’s stance on XR and a wide range of non-violent protest groups in response to an urgent question tabled in the House of Commons., Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, who was granted the urgent question, said the move to list XR was a “very serious error of judgment”, while the Conservative MP and former secretary of state, David Davis, accused the agencies of acting like “thought police”., Lewis said: “Counter-terrorism policing in this country is operationally independent. This is an important principle. The operational independence of our police from government is integral to our democracy., “The Home Office does, however, carry oversight of the police on behalf of the home secretary. We are clear that the right to peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our just society and an indispensable channel of political and social expression., “Counter-terrorism policing South-East have for example stated categorically that they do not classify Extinction Rebellion as an extremist organisation and the inclusion of Extinction Rebellion in their guidance to frontline officers was an error of judgment.

These include democracy and the rule of law, mutual respect and tolerance of other faiths and beliefs. We also consider calling for the death of our armed forces either in the UK or overseas to be extremism.”, Both anti-terror documents revealed by the Guardian encouraged anyone with concerns identified by the content to consider a referral to Prevent or report suspicious activity through the Action Counter Terrorism anonymous online form., Abbott said: “He (Lewis) is telling the house now it was an error of judgment but on this side of the house we would argue it was a very serious error of judgment.”, She added: “In a democracy there is a fundamental right to disagreement and non-violent campaigning and interfering or denying that right even in terms of an error of judgment is a fundamental breach of the democratic contract between the government and the governed.”, minister denies government considers extinction rebellion extremist", "label": 0}, "train-148": {"text": "US drinking water contamination with ‘forever chemicals’ far worse than scientists thought, Highest levels of PFAS in Miami, Philadelphia and New Orleans, report by environmental watchdog finds, The contamination of US drinking water with manmade “forever chemicals” is far worse than previously estimated with some of the highest levels found in Miami, Philadelphia and New Orleans, said a report on Wednesday by an environmental watchdog group., The chemicals, resistant to breaking down in the environment, are known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Some have been linked to cancers, liver damage, low birth weight and other health problems., The findings here by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) show the group’s previous estimate in 2018, based on unpublished US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, that 110 million Americans may be contaminated with PFAS, could be far too low., “It’s nearly impossible to avoid contaminated drinking water from these chemicals,” said David Andrews, a senior scientist at EWG and co-author of the report., The chemicals were used in products like Teflon and Scotchguard and in firefighting foam. Some are used in a variety of other products and industrial processes, and their replacements also pose risks., Of tap water samples taken by EWG from 44 sites in 31 states and Washington DC, only one location, Meridian, Mississippi, which relies on 700ft (215m) deep wells, had no detectable PFAS. Only Seattle and Tuscaloosa, Alabama had levels below 1 part per trillion (PPT), the limit EWG recommends., In addition, EWG found that on average six to seven PFAS compounds were found at the tested sites, and the effects on health of the mixtures are little understood. “Everyone’s really exposed to a toxic soup of these PFAS chemicals,” Andrews said., In 34 places where EWG’s tests found PFAS, contamination had not been publicly reported by the EPA or state environmental agencies., The EPA has known since at least 2001 about the problem of PFAS in drinking water but has so far failed to set an enforceable, nationwide legal limit.

The report’s authors warn that treating the world’s resources as limitless is leading towards global disaster., The materials used by the global economy have quadrupled since 1970, far faster than the population, which has doubled. In the last two years, consumption has jumped by more than 8% but the reuse of resources has fallen from 9.1% to 8.6%., The report, by the Circle Economy thinktank, was launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos. It shows that, on average, every person on Earth uses more than 13 tonnes of materials per year. But the report also found that some nations are making steps towards circular economies in which renewable energy underpins systems where waste and pollution are reduced to zero., “We risk global disaster if we continue to treat the world’s resources as if they are limitless,” said Harald Friedl, the chief executive of Circle Economy. “Governments must urgently adopt circular economy solutions if we want to achieve a high quality of life for close to 10bn people by mid-century without destabilising critical planetary processes.”, Marc de Wit, the report’s lead author, said: “We are still fuelling our growth in population and affluence by the extraction of virgin materials. We can’t do this indefinitely – our hunger for virgin material needs to be halted.”, The report found that 100.6bn tonnes of materials were consumed in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. Half of the total is sand, clay, gravel and cement used for building, along with the other minerals quarried to produce fertiliser. Coal, oil and gas make up 15% and metal ores 10%. The final quarter are the plants and trees used for food and fuel., The lion’s share of the materials – 40% – is turned into housing. Other major categories include food, transport, healthcare, communications, and consumer goods such as clothes and furniture., Almost a third of the annual materials remain in use after a year, such as buildings and vehicles. But 15% is emitted into the atmosphere as climate-heating gases and nearly a quarter is discarded into the environment, such as plastic in waterways and oceans. A third of the materials is treated as waste, mostly going to landfill and mining spoil heaps. Just 8.6% is recycled., “This report sparks an alarm for all governments,” said Carolina Schmidt, Chile’s environment minister. “We need to deploy all the policies to really catalyse this transformation to a circular economy.”, Cristianne Close of the conservation group WWF said: “The circular economy provides a framework for reducing our impacts, protecting ecosystems and living within the means of one planet.”, The report said increasing recycling can make economies more competitive, improve living conditions and help to meet emissions targets and avoid deforestation. It reported that 13 European countries have adopted circular economy roadmaps, including France, Germany and Spain, and that Colombia became the first Latin American country to launch a similar policy in 2019., China’s ban on waste imports aims to encourage domestic recycling, the report said, but has also stimulated the development of circular economy strategies in Australia and other countries which previously exported their waste to China., Janez Potočnik, a former European environment commissioner and the co-chair of the UN Environment Programme international resource panel, said the world needed to learn to do more with less and replace ownership with sharing, as is increasingly being seen with cars.worlds consumption of materials hits record 100bn tonnes a year", "label": 0}, "train-151": {"text": "\n'A whole sheep for £18': how live exports are hurting farmers in Romania\n, Country’s lack of meat processing facilities means livestock must be shipped to international markets – at a high cost to both shepherds and welfare , \nPaula Erizanu, \n\nWed 22 Jan 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 28 Jan 2020 05.48 EST\n\n, Gheorghe Dănulețiu, also known as Ghiță Ciobanul (Ghiță the shepherd), has more than 500,000 followers on Facebook after he featured in an advertising campaign that went viral, but he leads the modest life of a traditional shepherd., Looking after 1,500 sheep in western Romania, Dănulețiu’s life changes with the seasons. During lambing in spring, he barely sleeps four hours a night while in winter he leads his sheep in a three- to four-week journey from the mountains down to graze in the valleys., This week the Guardian’s Animals Farmed series is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled over the last fifty years., Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks. , Every day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals. , And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down., We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. , Even when the temperature drops below -30C(-22F), Dănulețiu sleeps next to his animals, wrapped in his sheepskin under the starry sky and ready to protect his flock in case of a wolf attack., “I inherited this role from my father – who had a few hundred sheep – but I also love it, I love animals,” Dănulețiu says., However, like all Romanian shepherds with small and medium-sized flocks, Dănulețiu is struggling in a market dominated by a few live animal exporters, big farmers and hypermarkets., “The sheep trade has become a mockery,” he says. “We sell a sheep for 100 Romanian leu (about £18). I can’t afford to pay good salaries and I can’t find workers any more – young people see that it’s all going downhill. I have the impression that this is political, that they’re trying to destroy the sector.”, Live export has become a crucial industry for Romania. In November the world watched in horror as more than 14,000 sheep drowned in the Black Sea port of Midia on their way to Saudi Arabia., Until then few people – even in Romania – had been aware of the scale of the live export trade. In fact in 2018, Romania exported animals worth €357m (£305m), making it Europe’s biggest exporter of live animals, and the tenth largest exporter of live cattle globally., The current arrangement dates back to the collapse of Nicolae Ceaușescu’s regime in the late 1980s, when Middle Eastern companies started taking over the Romanian live export market. Until the 2000s live exports went primarily to southern European countries such as Greece and Croatia, but in the 2010s Jordan, Libya, Lebanon and Israel also became valuable markets., Romania does not have the slaughterhouses to process the meat it needs. Although it has received subsidies totalling 26 billion euros since joining the EU in 2007, they are oriented towards production rather than building the processing systems that the country so urgently needs. So, despite the number of animals it exports, it has to import meats and other processed products., Like most sheep farmers in Romania, Dănulețiu has no option but to sell his animals to private collection centres for as little as £18 per head., The export firms sell these animals for 10 times that price in the Middle East and north Africa, although “the animals’ prices vary like stock prices”, according to a Lebanese businessman at one of the biggest agricultural exporters in Romania., The farmers are trapped in an impossible situation. Despite the deep roots of shepherding in Romania, lamb is consumed only at Easter. Moreover, the vast majority of sheep are of a mixed breed – țurcana – which are kept for milk as well as meat, making the meat less desirable on the European market., The financial realities of raising sheep mean there’s little profit in it and many shepherds are getting out., The situation is similar for cattle farmers in Romania. Sebastian Ile, who has a herd of 28 Angus cows, is trying to increase his negotiating power with exporting firms by forming a cooperative with eight other farmers. This means he can sell at a higher price per kilo – €2.5 compared to €1.8 – which is how much smaller farmers receive. But his ambitions go further than that., “Two years ago, we started off a big project to do the whole chain – from raising animals to processing and selling meat. But it will take a long time and we will need EU or national funds to bring the project to completion,” he says., Providing facilities for humane slaughter in countries of origin is critical, says Gabriel Paun of Animals International. Based in Romania, he has been investigating the animal export trade for several years, and gives first-hand accounts of the animals’ long journeys in sweltering heat, as well as the brutal nature of their slaughter in the Middle East., “Not only is this extremely cruel, but there’s also a solution that would please 99.99% of people, that is, the consumers and the farmers in the importing countries, as well as the Romanian farmers,” Paun explains. “The only ones who would not benefit from this solution are the exporting firms.”, That solution involves replacing live animal exports with meat and carcass exports, both of which Romanian and European policymakers are now discussing. In December the European Union called for an update on current legislation on animal transport over long distances, as well as discussions on the sustainability of live transport versus meat trade. At the moment, EU regulations dating from 2005 make EU countries responsible for exported animals only on EU territory, rather than until they reach their destination., The Romanian government has convened an agriculture commission to draft a new law regarding live animal exports, which would make Romania responsible for the state of the animals not only until the point of export, but all the way to the animals’ destination. If adopted, the law would be a first for the EU., The new law would also make it compulsory for ships to have a vet on board. Inspired by the legal framework for slaughterhouses in the UK, some members of the commission suggested CCTV to monitor the animals until they reach their destination., “This is a definite positive step in the right direction,” says Mary Pana, president of farmers’ union Acebop, which is part of the agriculture commission. The new proposal is aligned with Acebop’s current main priority – animal welfare., Within five years, Pana also hopes Romania can move towards exporting meat rather than live animals. “In order to do that, we want the government to approve the construction of two or three big capacity abattoirs by the seaside, with freezer storage, and then a large part of the problems will be solved,” she says., Romania’s minister of agriculture and rural development, Nechita-Adrian Oros, appears to agree. Commenting on the Midia incident, the minister said he hoped the tragedy would not be repeated, adding: “For Romania, it would be more economically advantageous not to export live animals but to export meat instead.”, For the farmers – who are battling harsh, low-paid conditions as well as corruption over EU subsidies and land ownership – these improvements could provide some inducement to stay on their farms., “Shepherding is a tradition we’ve had for hundreds of years in Romania and economic and political elites pursuing their selfish interests are slowly managing to destroy a national treasure,” says a pessimistic Dănulețiu. “I’m a patriot and I’m trying to hope that something will change for the better in this country. But if not, we’re coming to London, we have no option.”a whole sheep for 18 how live exports are hurting farmers in romania", "label": 0}, "train-152": {"text": "\nUK citizens' climate assembly to meet for first time\n, Randomly selected 110-strong panel will try to come up with a plan to tackle global heating, \nSandra Laville, \n\nWed 22 Jan 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 22 Jan 2020 06.37 EST\n\n, Ordinary people from across the UK – potentially including climate deniers – will take part in the first ever citizens’ climate assembly this weekend., Mirroring the model adopted in France by Emmanuel Macron, 110 people from all walks of life will begin deliberations on Saturday to come up with a plan to tackle global heating and meet the government’s target of net-zero emissions by 2050., The assembly was selected to be a representative sample of the population after a mailout to 30,000 people chosen at random. About 2,000 people responded saying they wanted to be considered for the assembly, and the 110 members were picked by computer., They come from all age brackets and their selection reflects a 2019 Ipsos Mori poll of how concerned the general population is by climate change, where responses ranged from not at all to very concerned. Of the assembly members, three people are not at all concerned, 16 not very concerned, 36 fairly concerned, 54 very concerned, and one did not know, organisers said., The selection process meant those chosen could include climate deniers or sceptics, according to Sarah Allan, the head of engagement at Involve, which is running the assembly along with the Sortition Foundation and the e-democracy project mySociety., “It is really important that it is representative of the UK population,” said Allen. “Those people, just because they’re sceptical of climate change, they’re going to be affected by the steps the government takes to get to net zero by 2050 too and they shouldn’t have their voice denied in that.”, The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:, • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest., • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load., • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.  , • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier., • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes., • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050., • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. , The UK climate assembly differs from the French model in that it was commissioned by six select committees, rather than by the prime minister. Their views, which will be produced in a report in the spring, will be considered by the select committees but there is no guarantee any of the proposals will be taken up by government., Allen said it was rare for members of a citizens’ assembly to get locked into dissent. She pointed to the success of the Irish citizens’ assembly in 2016, which helped break the deadlock in the abortion debate. “This climate assembly is going to come up with recommendations that are going to be really invaluable in highlighting public preferences,” she said., Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy at University College London, is one of four experts who will guide the members of the public in their decision-making. He acknowledged the scale of the challenges they faced in finding solutions to reaching net zero by 2050, which he said was “a hell of a job”., As well as four experts to the assembly, a panel of advisers including representatives from the Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, National Farmers’ Union, environmental NGOs and renewable energy companies have helped provide the questions on which assembly members will be asked to give their views., The key subjects to be considered will include transport, agriculture, domestic energy, and how consumerism is driving global heating. As well as policies such as bringing forward the ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040, the panel will consider technological solutions to cutting carbon emissions. Watson said many technological initiatives were surrounded by hype. “It is really important we get across to the assembly members not just that the option is x, but what the status of that option is in the world,” he said., The assembly will meet for four weekends. On the third weekend they will begin making decisions about ways to meet the net zero target., A spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, which is calling for the government to create and be led by the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate, said they welcomed the fact that such assemblies were being used in mainstream politics. “However, because it is not commissioned by the government it is not what we are looking for. We want something with real teeth, that has actual power to influence policy,” she said.uk citizens climate assembly meet first time", "label": 0}, "train-153": {"text": "\nCountry diary: disoriented birds can no longer tell day from light-polluted night\n, Sandy, Bedfordshire: A false dawn had begun at dusk the day before, with the bright beams from an industrial estate, \nDerek Niemann, \n\nWed 22 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, A good hour before sunrise, two song thrushes were in full voice in a small copse by the railway line. A little burst of this, a little snatch of that. What stirred them into pouring out attention-seeking nocturnes now? This was a time when tawny owl talons might be reaching for their last supper of the night., Out to the west, false dawn had begun at dusk the day before. The town’s street lamps, the glow-worms of winter, had fired the sky with a luminosity like dying embers. A far greater stimulus came from four blazing moons at the birds’ backs. A bank of security beams from the yard of an industrial estate whitened the trees, seeped into the hedgerow and lit the pale grass of the neighbouring field., This illuminated landscape was one of disorientating contrasts, the spotlights exposing every feature facing the factory to their remorseless glare, while all else was lost in deep shade. I stood before a stumpy tree that still held many of its leaves, curled like crinkled baubles. I could not fathom its species by vision alone in this bewildering chiaroscuro world, though I guessed at sycamore. This was an environment that mixed certainty and hunches., A few hundred metres on, I escaped into the comforting evenness of semi-darkness, where I could see that I couldn’t see. Thrush song sprinkled gently from far behind, and I looked back to find that distance had shrunk the harsh flares of the industrial estate to pinprick spots. The distraction broke my concentration; no sooner had I turned back than a teasel head came up at my thigh, taking hold with a disturbing animal-like force, tugging at my trouser leg, angrily insistent., Out to the east, colourful stars shone still at the end of this cloudy night, a vertical column of four reddish-orange lights rising above the wooded ridge. I joined the dots unthinkingly. These lights part-delineated the 244-metre-high mast of the Sandy Heath transmitter, a beacon for three counties, one that could be seen for 20 miles around.

It was the second, and most significant, of four regulatory hurdles Equinor needs to clear before it can drill., Peter Owen, the Wilderness Society’s South Australian director, said Equinor had refused to formally consult affected groups as required. He said the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, known as Nopsema, had made a legal error in accepting the company’s claims that it had., Owen said the decision effectively dismissed the concerns of environment groups representing tens of thousands of members, Indigenous custodians with cultural values threatened by offshore drilling and more than 20 local governments responsible for communities and coastal property as not relevant to the approval process., “We should all be very concerned about the precedent Equinor and Nopsema have set here,” he said. “We have no doubt that if Equinor had fully and legally consulted with these parties, its plans would have been better informed and more robust. Instead, it is our view that it now holds an invalid approval.”, Equinor declined to respond, saying it was not appropriate to comment on a matter before a court. The company has previously said its plan shows drilling can be done safely and it had been preparing its proposal for two and a half years, including more than 400 meetings with community and other organisations., It was granted a petroleum title over areas in the bight in 2011. The proposed Stromlo-1 well site is in water more than 2.2km deep and nearly 400km off the South Australian coast. Nopsema said it had approved the plan after a rigorous assessment that took almost eight months. Equinor still needs a well operations plan and a facility safety case approved before it can begin drilling., The regulator said it had imposed stringent conditions on its approval, including limits on the time of year activity can take place and regular public reporting on environmental impact, to ensure a high level of protection that reflected the bight’s uniqueness., It had earlier asked Equinor to modify and resubmit its environmental plan to provide more information on its consultation with affected groups and on the risks posed by oil spills. An analysis based on an amalgamation of 100 oil spill simulations found there was potential for a spill to spread along the coastline and into the ocean between Esperance in Western Australia, Sydney and Tasmania., Equinor’s plans have sparked protests that organisers say have been supported by tens of thousands of people across Australia. Owen said polling suggested a majority of Australians opposed the project., The conservation group’s federal court action is supported by Indigenous elders and Holdfast Bay council. Bunna Lawrie, an elder of the Mirning people, the traditional owners of the bight, said he feared drilling would lead to oil spills that poisoned the sea and affect whales., The council’s mayor, Amanda Wilson, said it was disappointed Nopsema had not considered its concerns about the potential economic and environmental impact of an oil spill, particularly on Glenelg. “Our 11km of pristine white sandy beaches in Holdfast Bay are a major drawcard for visitors and our local community, and it’s our duty to protect them,” she said., If approved, Equinor plans to begin work late this year, with the operations expected to last between 30 and 60 days.great australian bight wilderness society launches legal challenge to equinors oil drilling approval", "label": 0}, "train-155": {"text": "\nUK climate scientist corrects Australian MP Craig Kelly's 'blatant misrepresentation'\n, Prof Sandy Harrison tells the Liberal on his Facebook page that his misuse of her study should not go unchallenged, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nTue 21 Jan 2020 21.36 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 22 Jan 2020 07.47 EST\n\n, A leading UK climate scientist has used the Facebook page of the MP Craig Kelly to correct his “blatant misrepresentation” of a study she co-authored on a 70,000-year history of bushfires in Australia., Kelly, a serial denier of climate change, has been using the 2011 study to claim rising CO2 in the atmosphere can’t be linked to Australia’s bushfire crisis, because the study had shown total area being burned was going down while CO2 is rising., But Prof Sandy Harrison told Guardian Australia: “I am a working scientist and I do not routinely engage in arguments on social media, but I do not think that the misuse of scientific analyses should be allowed to go unchallenged.”, Kelly picked a sentence in the study that said all regions of Australia had shown reduced fires “during the last 50 years”., Kelly wrote: “Yet again, the truth is the exact opposite of the Alarmist narrative peddled in the media and swallowed, hook line &amp; sinker by the naive and gullible.”, But Harrison, of the University of Reading, told Guardian Australia the study was about historical changes, and “not about the modern situation”., She said: “The paper explicitly shows that climate warming intervals in the geologic record are characterised by more fire, all other things being equal, and thus demonstrates exactly the opposite to Mr Kelly’s claim.”, She said while it was correct that there had been a reduction in area burned, the scientists “provide an explanation for this in the very next sentence after the one Kelly quotes”., “Specifically, in many regions of the world, including Australia, human transformation of the landscape through the introduction of agriculture and infrastructure results in reduced fire spread and a reduced burnt area.”, She said a reduction in burnt area over the last 50 years “does not negate the fact that climate warming is going to lead to increases”., She said that “landscape fragmentation” had been countering the impact of global warming on the spread of fires, but added “the number of large and intense fires has gone up”., In her comment on Kelly’s Facebook post, she addresses Kelly directly, telling him his “reading of the science is partial”., Her comment reads: “The controls on fire are complex, but two things we know for certain are that other things being equal increased temperature lead to increased fires. Hence, since increasing atmospheric CO2 leads (amongst other things) to increased temperature, the ongoing climate changes we are experiencing will lead to increased fire., “It is, alas, not difficult to predict what will happen if politicians continue to take a partial and prejudiced view of the science. They will continue to ignore the fact that the evidence shows that, even if there has been a reduction in area burnt in the recent historical periods, there has been an increase in fire frequency and severity associated with human-induced climate change. And that the risk of catastrophic fires will continue to increase.”, She added: “As a scientist, my job is to tell you the facts. Your job is to act on them.”, Kelly has been prolific in his Facebook attacks on the “climate alarmist cult” and the “prophets of doom” in the past few weeks., In the past 24 hours, Kelly has posted six times, attacking climate campaigners at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland as “prophets of doom”, promoting Donald Trump’s attack on alarmists, attacking environment activist group Greenpeace, and other posts claiming “fake climate news”., Senior government MPs have tried to distance themselves from Kelly’s views, after he gave an interview earlier this month on the UK’s Good Morning Britain show in which he was described as a “denier”., While Australia continues to be devastated by bushfires, Kelly has launched angry attacks on climate scientists, often in all caps., On 3 January, Kelly linked to a blog by a UK group known as Principia Scientific International, which has previously claimed that CO2 is not a greenhouse gas., Responding to Harrison’s comments, Kelly has given interviews defending his statement, and repeating his original points. On Facebook he called the study an “inconvenient fact for the climate alarmist cult” and said the responses to it had been “pathetic”., Kelly wrote: “These researchers should be out their attempting to correct the harmful myth held by climate cultists – yet they appear too frightened to admit the facts of their own research.”, In defending his original post, he pointed to another study by Prof Stefan Doerr, who is currently the editor in chief of the International Journal of Wildfire., But last week Doerr joined colleagues to carry out a “rapid review” of the science on bushfires, saying: “The fact that fires are increasing in areas within or near closed canopy forest is the key issue of concern. This is one of the land cover types where direct impact on societies is greatest., “It is also important to highlight that most studies predict increased lightning activity in a warming atmosphere, which further exacerbates wildfire risk.”, • This article was amended on 22 January 2020.

We acted within hours and the decision was very clear., “It is a conflict in terms of us working with extractive resources industries and with thermal coal. That was a commercial decision by Greyhound but it clearly conflicts with what we believe is right for the Great Barrier Reef.”, De Waal resigned “within minutes” of the start of the board meeting. Ridley said the foundation had been unaware of Greyhound’s contract with the Adani project until being contacted on Tuesday afternoon for comment., “We didn’t know,” said Ridley. “The challenge is that we had a good partnership with Greyhound and we strongly supported them as a means of transport because of its low footprint and that 40,000 of their customers gave us a dollar. We will miss that funding.”, In the internal email sent to Greyhound staff, the company had defended its decision by promoting its partnership with Ridley’s foundation., De Waal wrote: “Greyhound could become one of many companies in the crossfire of the anti-Adani campaign.”, The email revealed the company, which has more than 600 staff, had won a three-month contract “with an opportunity for extension” to move workers for construction firm BMD, which is building the mine’s railway from the Galilee Basin to Abbot Point., “The project may create concerns to individual team members in light of the international political, environmental, social and economic debate about climate change under way in the media,” the email read., A seperate public relations plan prepared for Greyhound, also seen by Guardian Australia, had produced a series of potential questions that could be aimed at the company’s chief executive, and had offered media training to respond to them., One question that De Waal should be prepared to answer, the PR plan said, was: “Surely you will resign as chairman of the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef and/or Greyhound Australia given your conflict of interest?”, Greyhound Australia said it had no comment on the decision.great barrier reef group severs ties with greyhound over adani contract", "label": 0}, "train-157": {"text": "\nTrump administration strips pollution safeguards from drinking water sources\n, \nOliver Milman in New York, \n\nThu 23 Jan 2020 12.35 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 23 Jan 2020 13.01 EST\n\n, The Trump administration has completed its rollback of environmental protections for streams, wetland and other bodies of water, a process that has stripped pollution safeguards from drinking water sources used by around a third of all Americans., Clean water protections strengthened under the Obama administration have long been targeted by Donald Trump, who has called it a “very destructive and horrible rule”., Trump has been backed by ranchers, farming groups and golf course operators, who claim the so-called “Water of the United States” (Wotus) rule impinged upon landowners’ rights., The Obama-era water rule was repealed last year and on Thursday the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a weakened replacement that removes millions of miles of streams and around half of America’s wetlands from federal oversight, potentially allowing pesticides and other pollutants to be dumped into them without penalty., The move has dismayed former EPA staff who worked on the expansion of protections to ephemeral streams that supply drinking water to an estimated 117 million people in the US., “The new rule is scientifically indefensible and socially unjust,” said Betsy Southerland, who was scientific director of the EPA’s office of water for three decades before departing in 2017., “This EPA’s Wotus definition, which will limit federal water quality protections to a very small set of waters and wetlands, will result in the impairment of drinking water, fisheries and flood control for communities throughout the US.”, The Trump administration had promised the demise of the water rule to industry groups that lobbied against what they saw as costly federal overreach. “This new rule will provide much-needed clarity and regulatory certainty for companies that site and build infrastructure that delivers essential energy to America’s communities,” said Karen Harbert, chief executive of the American Gas Association., But opponents of the repeal point out that the replacement regime not only scraps the Obama-era rule but also reverses protections reaching back to the 1972 Clean Water Act, such as requirements that landowners seek permits that the EPA considers on a case-by-case basis., The new, far narrower, definition of water protections will maintain safeguards for major rivers such as the Mississippi River and the Colorado River but not short-lived streams that feed into them after it rains or snow melts. About 60% of streams in the US are dry for part of the year but then connect to large rivers following rainfall. Wetlands not situated next to large rivers will also be excluded from protections., People living in the western US are set to be particularly affected by the new rule, with ephemeral streams making up around 89% of Nevada’s stream miles and 94% of Arizona’s, for example., Environmental groups warn that as many as 75 endangered species dependent on temporary streams will be imperilled by the move, while any degradation of wetlands would also harm wildlife and worsen the climate crisis by lessening their ability to store carbon., Trump told the World Economic Forum at Davos this week that the US has “among the cleanest air and drinking water on Earth”, despite widespread contamination with chemicals such as PFAS and neurotoxins such as lead in Americans’ water., The Trump administration has dismantled about 100 environmental rules while in office, including the reversal of a ban on mining companies dumping their waste into rivers., “The ‘dirty water rule’ will put clean drinking water for tens of millions of people at risk, especially the low-income communities and communities of colour already disproportionately impacted by polluted water,” said Madeleine Foote, deputy legislative director of the League of Conservation Voters., “Clean, safe drinking water is a basic human right and we should be doing more to protect our water resources, not less,” she added., Another expert warned of additional risks., “The goal of the Trump administration rollback is to reduce the obligations of farmers, ranchers and other landowners in their requirements to protect water quality in the US,” said Catherine Kling, an environmental economist at Cornell University., “This will lower regulatory costs to that group of Americans. But there are costs to the environment that will be borne by other Americans.”, These include, Kling said, the loss of healthy drinking water, algal blooms that sicken swimmers and pets and reduced value of properties near waterways.trump clean water protections rule rollback", "label": 0}, "train-158": {"text": "\nHow the Middle East's water shortage drives demand for live animal imports\n, The increasingly dry region relies on imports of sheep and cows from as far as Brazil to satisfy the rapidly growing population, \nRuth Michaelson in Cairo and \nBibi van der Zee in Beirut, \n\nThu 23 Jan 2020 10.37 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 20.02 EDT\n\n, Cows are waiting in pens, on sweet-smelling fresh straw. They have come to Lebanon from Spain, from Romania. In the one end of the alley are two pens packed with enormous Brahman cattle, standing well over six feet with their distinctive humps, all the way from Brazil., “They are the most aggressive,” says one of the slaughterhouse staff. “It’s just their personalities.”, As the Beirut traffic continues its usual honking chaos outside, the animals wait to be slaughtered. When the time comes they go, one at a time, through the hatch into the gleaming tiled kill room., This week the Guardian’s Animals Farmed series is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled over the last fifty years., Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks. , Every day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals. , And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down., We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. , “They don’t see each other being killed,” says our guide. They are put on a hoist and tugged up by their legs, and then their throat is slit. There is no stunning here: the cattle is slaughtered according to the rules of halal, which in most interpretations means that the animal should be conscious when it dies. The floor glistens with water; it is washed down between each kill so the animals can’t smell the blood, although they may notice the carcasses of their brethren, dangling from hoists around them., The killing must be quick and well done, says one slaughterhouse employee, in his early twenties. He doesn’t like to think about what he does, he says. But it’s a job., The reputation of slaughterhouses in the Middle East is poor among animal welfare campaigners. Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farmings says that in his 28-year career “there is nothing I have seen as awful as slaughterhouses” in the Middle East. Investigation after investigation has exposed filthy conditions, little or no concern for animal welfare, badly trained staff, and, above all, the practice of halal slaughter, which often means animals are killed without being stunned first., Live animal exports to the Middle East have risen steadily over the past two decades, particularly from Europe. Trade to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia has risen steeply over the last fifteen years. In just one year, Turkey went from importing $600m (£457m)  worth of animals in 2016 to $1.2bn in 2017., There are a number of reasons for the rise, but it is mainly due to an increasing demand for meat and dairy products, and rapidly warming climate pressuring water-stressed nations. Those nations that can afford the political or financial cost are increasingly looking to avoid rearing animals from birth, the more water-intensive option., As growing populations continue to demand freshly-killed, Middle Eastern nations are increasingly leaning on live imports to meet this need, and reshaping the global marketplace in the process., It’s a region where meat is often seen as a status symbol of a family’s ability to provide, and serving meat to a hungry guest is considered a demonstration of hospitality and generosity. The Islamic high holiday Eid al-Adha – which translates as festival of sacrifice, honouring the biblical figure Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his only son – requires that families slaughter a live animal, often a cow, sheep or goat, and distribute the meat between family, friends and neighbours, and the needy., The Middle East’s growing middle class has also swelled demand, along with overall population growth., “We’ve seen a significant increase in the middle class bracket across the Middle East over the last two decades,” says Emily Hawthorne, from private global intelligence firm Stratfor. “There’s the status symbol that comes from a live sheep – or better yet, a live cow or goat – for Eid al-Adha, as well as for weddings and festivals; the growth of the Middle Eastern middle class has a lot to do with this. This, for example, is why you see Gulf countries playing a huge part in live imports from Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan.”, Australia recently enacted a three-month ban on live exports to the Middle East, after a furore over animal welfare concerns. But when one exporting country pulls back, others step forward. “In the midst of a growing demand from Qatar, the UAE, Kuwait and other Gulf countries for Eid al-Adha, other countries supplement gaps in supply,” says Hawthorne, listing India, Pakistan and Iran as potential live exporters willing to step in when Australia and other big exporters bail out. “Live export is a thing where you see – political proclivities aside – people need to import what communities are demanding,” she says., Ironically, the warming climate also plays a role in the trade: the lack of water across the Middle East means that it is cheaper to import animals rather than raise them from birth. Dairy cows, a popular import from America and Germany, drink 30–50 gallons of water per day, with high-producing ones consuming even more. Cattle reared for meat consume slightly less water, but the overall amount is enough to encourage water-scarce countries to look for ways to shorten the amount of time they have to care for the animals, while reaping the benefits for their meat industries., “The water shortage in the Gulf is profound and will only get worse as the population increases,” says Hawthorne. “The reality is that they cannot support water-intense livestock and agriculture on the ground. This means the time you hold livestock is important. As it’s expensive, you can only hold them for a temporary period.”, A US official with knowledge of the Middle Eastern agriculture industry says countries across the region routinely import beef cattle six months before they are due to be slaughtered, a period in an animal’s life when it requires cheaper feed. Crucially, rearing an animal only in its final stage of life also cuts down on water consumption, a key advantage for water-scarce nations in the Gulf and across north Africa., “Sudan is the largest single supplier of live animals – mostly cows – to Egypt,” they explain, as an example. In Egypt, where the government has placed a premium on local beef, producers import cows at 12-months old, raising them for a final six months before slaughter in order to save on water and the expensive nutrient-rich feed the animals need earlier in life. “Egyptian beef farmers can then sell at market and say their product is Egyptian beef. But in terms of Sudanese water and feed – Egypt saves on those resources,” the official adds., This bait-and-switch tactic could also benefit authorities’ claims to be helping local producers. “There are many programmes to expand domestic animal production. By importing animals grown in Sudan, rearing them for six months then selling them as Egyptian beef, the government can say: ‘look we’re helping Egyptian farmers’,” the official explains., But as the trade grows, the issues around management and oversight of slaughterhouses in the region become more pressing. A 2014 investigation by Compassion in World Farming with Animals Australia allegedly uncovered footage of animals exported from the EU being violently handled in abattoirs in the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, including being dragged into position by their tails and even eye sockets., “Criticism of slaughter standards in the Middle East is not a disparagement of their religion,” says Stevenson., “Whenever Muslims see our films they are horrified and say ‘this is not halal’. Traditional religious slaughter calls for one clean cut which severs all of the major blood vessels so the animal loses blood and dies quickly, but in reality animals often receive many stabs and cuts to the throat before losing consciousness … in the slaughterhouse we’ve seen they don’t know how to handle cattle, they’re frightened of them.”, Change is underway, however. In Turkey, steady work by Eyes On Animals and other groups has led to the acceptance of the use of stun guns in some abattoirs, and in October last year Ismailağa Cemaati, the largest Islamic group in the country, publically announced that stunning animals prior to killing them is acceptable and halal., Additional research by Massinissa Benlakehal.how the middle easts water shortage drives demand for live animal imports", "label": 0}, "train-159": {"text": "\nRevealed: top official did special favors on guns for NRA at interior department\n, \nRevealed: top official did special favors on guns for NRA at interior department\n, Powerful gun lobby group has used connections in Trump administration to influence decisions, messages show, \nJimmy Tobias, \n\nThu 23 Jan 2020 06.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 23 Jan 2020 11.20 EST\n\n, In the fall of 2017, a National Rifle Association lobbyist named Benjamin Cassidy left his job at the influential gun group. His next stop: a top position at the US interior department, which oversees hundreds of millions of acres of federal land across the country., Once in office, it didn’t take Cassidy long to use his new government gig to provide his longtime NRA colleagues with special access to the powerful federal agency, as revealed by previously unreleased communications obtained by the Guardian., The messages underscore the potent influence that industry lobbyists and conservative organizations enjoy at a government agency where many key leaders are former lobbyists and conservative activists themselves. The NRA has made the most of this dynamic during the Trump presidency, leveraging its connections to shape policy outcomes and personnel decisions at the interior department., In 2017, for instance, Susan LaPierre, a prominent NRA member and the wife of NRA leader Wayne LaPierre, was appointed by the head of the interior department to the board of the National Parks Foundation, a congressionally chartered organization that supports park programs., The interior secretary, David Bernhardt, has also made multiple appearances on NRA media channels in recent years, and in June he announced a proposal to open more than 1.4m acres of national wildlife refuge land to hunting and fishing activities. The NRA celebrated the move, calling it a “proposal supported and encouraged by the NRA”. , Just this week, Bernhardt tweeted that “Respecting our second amendment is fundamental to our constitutional republic. We’re expanding opportunities to enjoy hunting and recreational shooting on our wonderful public lands.”, But Benjamin Cassidy is the official that most embodies the NRA’s influence at the interior department., Starting in October 2017, and for months afterward, Cassidy served as a key contact for the gun group inside the interior department, helping the NRA translate its priorities into action from his perch at the agency’s external affairs office. The NRA spent roughly $30m helping Donald Trump win the presidency in 2016. With assistance from its former lobbyist, Cassidy, it has since reaped rewards in the realm of federal public land and wildlife policy., In one instance, emails show, he sought to arrange a sitdown between Bernhardt, then the deputy secretary, and Chris Cox, a top NRA official. (An interior department spokesperson said Bernhardt did not attend any such meeting.), In another case, he appears to have helped an NRA official join the International Wildlife Conservation Council (IWCC), an advisory body set up by the department to help shape policy regarding “international recreational hunting”. In a December 2017 email, Erica Rhoad, the director of hunting policy at NRA, wrote to Cassidy: “Ben, Attached please find two nominations for the IWCC.”, “Thank you,” Cassidy replied. Rhoad, who was one of the nominees, eventually obtained the position she sought on the IWCC, which was stacked with pro-hunting advocates. The IWCC would go on to promote big-game trophy hunting overseas, a longtime NRA priority. In 2018, conservationists sued to disband the council, and their case is ongoing., Most significantly, Cassidy was in regular communication with NRA about recreational shooting policy on federal lands. Almost immediately after joining DOI in October 2017, for instance, Cassidy reached out to Susan Recce, director of the NRA’s conservation, wildlife and natural resources program, asking her to weigh in on an interior department plan to limit recreational shooting at the Sonoran Desert national monument in Arizona, a plan the NRA was keenly interested in., “Hi Susan! Hope you are great!” he wrote in an email.“Do you have a quick moment to hop on the phone and discuss recreational shooting in the sonoran desert? We have a deadline that is due today.”, Target shooting in the Sonoran Desert national monument in Arizona is controversial – it has damaged archeological artifacts, destroyed saguaro cacti, and harmed other natural and cultural resources., Recce replied with an NRA plan to leave more of the monument open to target shooting., In the weeks that followed, Cassidy kept Recce updated on the progress of that target-shooting plan and others, including a proposal to restrict target shooting on public lands in Utah, which the NRA opposed., In the case of the Sonoran Desert national monument, the NRA got what it wanted. In March 2018, the department signed its final plan, which aligned almost perfectly with the NRA’s request, leaving roughly 90% of the monument open to recreational shooting., Susan Recce thanked Cassidy for his help in a note that testifies to their close ties.“I appreciate you riding herd over the agency plans affecting recreational shooting,” she wrote to him in a January 2018 email, using a cowboy term to describe his role taking the lead on target shooting issues., In August 2019, the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club and other conservation groups sued the interior department over the issue, and their lawsuit is working its way through the courts., Under federal ethics guidelines, government employees are prohibited from giving “preferential treatment to any private organization or individual”., “The fact that the Trump administration considered an anti-environment lobbyist like Ben Cassidy qualified to oversee our public lands speaks volumes about who it values and how it operates,” said congressman Raúl Grijalva, the chairman of the House natural resources committee, in a statement. “Mr Cassidy weakened endangered species rules, lobbied against the Antiquities Act from inside the government, almost certainly violated his ethics pledge, and generally treated public service as a chance to dispense political favors to his friends.”, Cassidy himself became uncomfortable with his ongoing relationship with the NRA. In an October 2018 email to an NRA staffer, he informed the gun group that he could no longer work directly with it., “Unfortunately, due to the ethics ban, I am unable to work with the NRA on issues for one more year,” he wrote. He suggested the NRA get in touch with other officials at the department instead., But it was too late. In April 2019, the interior department’s inspector general opened an investigation into allegations that Cassidy’s conduct had violated federal ethics rules, including the White House’s own ethics pledge. That investigation is currently active., Not long afterward, Cassidy quietly stepped down from his post. In July 2019, he took a new job: director of government affairs at Safari Club International, a powerful national organization that promotes trophy hunting in the United States and overseas., In a statement, the interior department said it “will not comment on Mr Cassidy’s motives or reasoning on leaving the department”. Neither the NRA nor Cassidy’s new employer responded to a request for comment.revealed e mails show that nra shaped gun policy at interior department", "label": 0}, "train-160": {"text": "\nAppetite for 'warm meat' drives risk of disease in Hong Kong and China\n, \nAppetite for 'warm meat' drives risk of disease in Hong Kong and China\n, A wet market, where animals are freshly slaughtered rather than chilled was identified as the source of the coronavirus outbreak.

They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down., We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. , Before sunrise the caravan makes its way five-and-a-half miles south to the border at Man Kam To, a small customs and immigration checkpoint, where the pigs go through further visual health checks before crossing into Hong Kong., They are bound for Sheung Shui slaughterhouse, the largest of three abattoirs in the territory. Once there they will be checked again before being dispatched in less than 24 hours under new rules meant to prevent the spread of ASF., It’s a lot of effort to get fresh meat from the 1,400 pigs that cross the border each day., For various reasons, the Chinese prefer freshly slaughtered pig, chicken and beef over chilled or frozen meat that has been slaughtered before being shipped., That desire is at the heart of why diseases such as avian flu in poultry and ASF have been so difficult to eradicate, with huge movements of live animals from all over the country – from farm to slaughterhouse to market – on a daily basis making controlling the spread of disease incredibly difficult.A recent coronavirus outbreak in China has been linked to a wet market in Wuhan, eastern China. Like other respiratory illnesses, the disease was initially transmitted from animal to human, but is now being passed human to human., At the nearby Walmart, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market., But despite awareness of the issues, the markets are a huge part of Chinese life. On a busy morning at a so-called “wet market” in the Shajing area, the oldest inhabited and very Cantonese part of Shenzhen, hundreds of shoppers arrive soon after daybreak. Slabs of pork hang from the stalls and various cuts are piled on the counters amid lights with a reddish glare and the occasional buzzing of flies., Just a few minutes away at the nearby Walmart, where there are also options for fresh, chilled and frozen meat, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market. It has your average western supermarket vibe – white daylight lighting, sterile and clean., Staff at the meat counter in Walmart and at the stalls in the wet market both say the meat comes in from the same slaughterhouse around 2am. So why the huge difference in foot traffic?, Molly Maj, a corporate communications representative for Walmart, says “the average customer in China still prefers fresh meat” over other options., One reason for the demand for wet markets is that widespread refrigeration only came to China in recent years. While most urban homes now have refrigerators, many in rural areas and low income urban renters still do not own one, or only a mini-fridge if they do., The habit of buying perishable food for daily use is still prevalent in many consumers, particularly older shoppers who grew up without refrigerators. They say they can tell the quality of fresh meat by its smell, colour and how it feels to the touch., “When I’m talking with my students I say: ‘The term warm meat, fresh meat, sounds disgusting to me, I grew up in Germany with chilled meat, that’s all I know,” Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine at City University in Hong Kong and an expert on diseases related to animal husbandry, says., “So I ask them why and they come up with all sorts of vague things like the soup tastes better or that it is a trust issue, knowing it is a live animal at the other end and not some diseased animal,” he says. “It’s all very subjective.”, Wet markets are central to the perception that fresh meat is better, says Pfeiffer. They evoke nostalgia among shoppers, many of whom come from rural areas where all they knew were wet markets and no refrigeration., Where a wet market feels familiar a supermarket can seem alien and out of place., “I actually believe that it is an important thing for the older generation to go to the wet market and chat,” says Pfeiffer. However, the way the animal trade operates in China is “an utter disaster”, for animal disease and welfare, he adds., A year ago, before rising concerns about the spread of ASF, nearly 4,000 pigs crossed daily with less scrutiny. Pigs were held in dismal conditions for as long as five days before being slaughtered on the Hong Kong side, greatly enhancing the possibility of disease transmission, says Pfeiffer.The recent shortages due to the ASF outbreak have doubled and tripled prices for fresh pork at wet markets across Hong Kong. Farms in Hong Kong itself can usually supply about 300 pigs a day. Land use and environmental restrictions prevent any increase in production. The result is further worries about Hong Kong’s reliance on mainland China beyond its water and energy dependence., “Many years ago, we had imports from all over Asia of live animals, but eventually the entire supply was monopolised by mainland China,” said Helena Wong, a member of Hong Kong’s legislative council panel on food safety and environmental hygiene. “They killed all their competitors and monopolised the supply of live pig and chicken.”, More than 6,000 pigs at the Sheung Shui slaughterhouse were culled in May 2019 after ASF was found among animals brought in from China. Hong Kong’s legislative council is now trying to figure out how much it owes traders and farmers in compensation., Massive culls of poultry due to avian flu in imported mainland chickens in the last decade also led to large compensation bills and, eventually, to ending live chicken imports in early 2016., “We as taxpayers have to give that money,” said Wong. “So now we are in a big crisis because in the past few years we have experienced avian flu and now African swine fever.”, Disease outbreaks have raised wider questions about the sustainability of Chinese consumers’ appetite – both on the mainland and in Hong Kong – for what is often called “warm” meat.For Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and an expert on animal protection in China, a deeper issue driving the live animal trade is a cultural disconnect about animal welfare., “The main problem is the indifference or perception of people who simply regard animals as food, tools, or as things that people can do anything they want to,” she said., “In particular, there is no perception of farm animals as having feelings, or being capable of feeling pain or suffering.”, Hong Kong may find it difficult to switch to a different model. There is almost no chance of farm expansion to support larger scale production within Hong Kong and, although the government is looking at possibilities of live imports from other Asian countries, the ports do not have adequate facilities to cope with large numbers., “To a large extent, if we insist on fresh food, we have to rely on China,” said Wong. “If we can change and make certain concessions, Hong Kong has always been an open market for importing food items from many parts of the world. It is only for the provision of live animals that we are monopolised by the mainland farms.”, Reporting assistance from Zhong Yunfan.appetite for warm meat drives risk of disease in hong kong and china", "label": 0}, "train-161": {"text": "\nMake big polluters pay for mass tree planting, officials say\n, Oil companies and airlines could fund 100m trees a year, says Committee on Climate Change, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nThu 23 Jan 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 23 Jan 2020 01.02 EST\n\n, The planting of 100m trees a year in the UK to tackle the climate emergency could be paid for by new carbon levies on oil companies and airlines, the government’s official climate adviser has proposed., The Committee on Climate Change also recommends banning the burning of grouse moors and the sale of peat compost to protect the nation’s bogs, which can store huge amounts of carbon. Voluntary measures have failed, it said., The CCC’s new report concludes that fundamental changes in land use are needed to cut emissions from farming and get the nation on track to meet its legally binding target of net zero by 2050. It proposes cutting red meat eating by 20%, with the move to more plant-based diets freeing up a fifth of all farmland for new woodland., The CCC’s plan for slashing emissions from agriculture also requires better management of manure, cutting methane from cattle with better feeds and growing crops that can be burned to produce electricity instead of natural gas., The plan would cost £1.4bn a year but provide benefits of at least £4bn by cutting global heating and air pollution and improving flood protection and green spaces for people to enjoy. “That, in our assessment, seems like a price very much worth paying,” said Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC., Lord Deben, chair of the CCC, said: “This is one of the most important reports that we have ever produced because a change in land use is absolutely essential if we’re going to meet the legal requirements of reducing to net zero by 2050. It requires immediate government action. We are in a race against time.”, The UK is preparing to leave the European Union and the bloc’s subsidy scheme, which provides £3.3bn a year to farmers based mainly on the area of land owned. The government has pledged that the replacement scheme will pay farmers public money for public goods, such as tree planting., Other groups have called for radical overhauls of farmland, which occupies 70% of the UK. Rewilding Britain suggests that a quarter of the UK’s land could be restored to nature, while an RSA commission said the true costs of cheap food were the climate crisis and a health crisis. A former chief scientific adviser to the UK government said in December that half of the nation’s farmland needed to be transformed into woodlands and natural habitat., The most eye-catching part of the CCC’s plan, according to Stark, is the proposal that new levies on fossil fuel suppliers, airlines and other carbon-emitting industries pay for the tree-planting programme. Farmers and landowners would be paid either via annual auctions of contracts to create woodland or from a carbon trading scheme, the CCC said., The cost would be about £700m a year, Stark said. “You could imagine a world where that was all paid for from a fossil fuel levy, but that is a decision for the Treasury.” Such a system would mean the polluter pays, said Deben, but the aviation industry would still need to keep emissions at 2005 levels., The National Farmers Union revealed a plan for agriculture to end its net emissions by 2040 in September, a decade earlier than the CCC plan. It requires no cut in meat eating or livestock numbers and no conversion of substantial areas of farmland into forest. It relies heavily on bioenergy crops removing CO2 from the atmosphere, which is then captured and buried after being burned., Deben praised the NFU plan as a remarkable change. “NFU president, Minette Batters, has done a very significant job. But the truth is she hasn’t been able to include anything about diet and reduction in the number of animals”, both of which the CCC deem essential., Stark said cutting the UK’s “scandalous” level of food waste by 20% was vital. Better food labelling and separate food waste collections would help, as well as linking charges for household recycling to the quantity of food waste, the CCC said., The 20% cut in red meat and dairy consumption proposed by the CCC is much lower than other recent analyses which have indicated 80-90% reductions are needed. “It is some way short of the 80% or so reduction that’s recommended by the public health guidelines for red meat,” said Stark. The CCC focused only on the emissions cuts needed to bring UK greenhouse gas emissions to zero, he said, and not health or other pollution that livestock cause., “There is no doubt we need a major transformation in farming and land use to tackle both climate and nature emergencies,” said Vicki Hird of the Sustain alliance, who welcomed much of the report. But she said the ambition on cutting meat consumption was low and warned that technology that could capture CO2 from bioenergy crops was untested in the UK., Sandra Bell, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The way land is used and abused has been a big contributor to climate breakdown and loss of wildlife, and this is why it needs to change.” However she said the CCC’s woodland creation target needed to be twice as high.make big polluters pay for mass tree planting officials say", "label": 0}, "train-162": {"text": "\nCountry diary: the quiet miracle of the common feather-moss\n, Wenlock Edge, Shropshire: Species such as this one contain a remarkable reservoir of potentially medicinal chemicals, \nPaul Evans, \n\nThu 23 Jan 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, Green feathers in the wood, the plumage of moss: it appears unaffected by a squall that rattles up the lane.

That’s not much different than last year’s tally, when an all-time low 27,000 monarchs were counted., “We had hoped that the western monarch population would have rebounded at least modestly, but unfortunately it has not,” said Emma Pelton, a monarch conservation expert with the Xerces Society., By comparison, about 4.5 million monarch butterflies wintered in forested groves along the California coast in the 1980s. Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in the Western US due to the destruction of their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases., Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change. Along with farming, climate change is one of the main drivers of the monarch’s threatened extinction, disrupting an annual 3,000-mile migration synced to springtime and the blossoming of wildflowers., Western monarch butterflies head south to California each winter, returning to the same sites and even the same trees where they cluster to keep warm. The monarchs generally arrive in California at the beginning of November and spread across the country once warmer weather arrives in March., On the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, another monarch butterfly population travels from southern Canada and the north-eastern United States across thousands of miles to spend the winter in central Mexico. Mexican officials said last year the butterfly population wintering there was rebounding but they have not yet released this year’s count., A 2017 study by Washington State University researchers found the species will probably go extinct in the next few decades if nothing is done to save it., The monarch is now under government consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act. The decision on whether the butterfly will be listed as threatened is expected by December., While helping the western butterflies could seem daunting, Pelton said the fact that the population had not shrunk any further is encouraging., Pelton said people could help by planting early-blooming flowers and milkweed to fuel migrating monarchs on their paths to other states., The Xerces Society is working with the state of California to protect the butterflies’ wintering sites and develop new sites in state parks., “There are still thousands of monarchs wintering along the coast, so we can take heart that it’s not too late to act,” Pelton said.monarch butterfly population decline california coast", "label": 0}, "train-164": {"text": "\nMinisters doing little towards 2050 emissions target, say top scientists\n, Experts call for sweeping policy changes and warn against Heathrow expansion, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 13.38 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Jan 2020 13.54 EST\n\n, Expanding Heathrow airport is unlikely to be compatible with the UK’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, leading scientists have said, adding that government policies are lacking in many other key areas from home insulation and transport to carbon capturing., Achieving the net zero goal will require sweeping policy changes, but scientists are concerned that little has so far been forthcoming from ministers., Home insulation and energy efficiency are essential to reducing carbon emissions from heating, but have been left in a “policy vacuum”, said Dr Charlie Wilson, a reader in energy and climate change at the University of East Anglia., Systems to capture and store carbon dioxide would also be needed, but previous government attempts to kickstart the technology over the past two decades have been abandoned, said Jim Skea, professor of sustainable energy at Imperial College London. Skea said the UK had many advantages over other countries in CCS, such as spent oilfields in the North Sea to use as storage, the skills and infrastructure from oil and gas exploration, and public backing for the technology, but needed the government to step in., Corinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change science at UEA, called for the government to prioritise the net zero goal across all policy areas., “Every minister should have a plan for their own policy area on how to reach net zero,” she said. “Some infrastructure must be phased out. Ministers should be preparing in a way that is well coordinated and fair, so that the public are brought on board.”, No part of government, and no part of the economy and society, could be left unaffected if the push towards net zero was to be successful, said Skea. “We really need to do it all,” he said. “Nothing can be wiped off the table. No sector can be left to not contribute – really, this needs contributions from absolutely everything.”, There is no cabinet minister with responsibility for achieving the net zero target, and no intermediate goals before 2050, apart from the advice on carbon budgets from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government’s statutory advisors., On Thursday, the CCC called for major changes to the UK’s land use, including more trees, the restoration of peatland and an end to the burning of grouse moors, to improve the UK’s carbon sinks., The expansion of Heathrow, which was given a green light under Theresa May, was not consistent with the net zero goals, a group of six experts said on Friday., “I find it difficult to imagine we can control emissions from aviation if we continue to build airports,” said Le Quéré. “We absolutely need ambitious plans for mobility and transport. We need a plan that covers roads and airports.”, Pierre Friedlingstein, professor of mathematical modelling of climate systems at Exeter University, said: “This is a clear example of not going in the right direction.”, Wilson said: “We desperately need consistent, concerted direction from the government and building new airport capacity is not that.”, Skea said it was possible for people to continue taking flights under a net zero target, but that the rapid growth of flying in recent years must be curtailed. “It’s not that people must stop flying, but that the increase in flying should be less than it otherwise would be,” he said., One way of achieving this fairly would be through a frequent flyer levy, according to Lorraine Whitmarsh, professor of environmental psychology at Cardiff University. “The sense that it is a fair policy is very important,” she said. “These policy interventions are likely to be quite effective.”ministers doing little to achieve 2050 emissions target say top scientists heathrow expansion", "label": 0}, "train-165": {"text": "\nThe week in wildlife – in pictures\n, The week in wildlife – in pictures, The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, including white-tailed eagles and a detained lion cub, \nEric Hilaire, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 12.28 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Jan 2020 13.01 EST\n\n, Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Orhan Şeref Akkanat/Getty Images, Photograph: Kirill Kukhmar/Tass/Getty Images, Photograph: Sandra Standbridge/Alamy, Photograph: Nick Edwards/The Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation/Forestry England, Photograph: AmazingActionShots/Alamy, Photograph: David Stowe/AP, Photograph: Minas Keukazian/Alamy, Photograph: Sven Torfinn/Food and Agriculture Organization/EPA, Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP, Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters, Photograph: BTO, Photograph: Ashwini Bhatia/AP, Photograph: Angie Teo/Reuters, Photograph: Ashraf Shazly/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Reuters Staff/Reuters, Photograph: Dmitry Rogulin/Tass/Getty Images, Photograph: Mahesh Kumar A/AP, Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP, Photograph: Matthew Tostevin/Reutersthe week in wildlife in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-166": {"text": "\n‘Something is wrong’: why the live animal trade is booming in Europe\n, Regulation breaches and fewer, larger slaughterhouses have led to growing numbers of animals travelling further to slaughter, \nBibi van der Zee, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 11.08 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 20.02 EDT\n\n, The live animal export trade has ballooned in Europe while the commission fails to enforce its own regulations, MEPs have told the Guardian., A second attempt to set up an inquiry committee to look into the handling of the problem is now underway, after an earlier proposal was dismissed in 2018., In the past 20 years the EU has become one of the global centres for animal export. Within the bloc animals are travelling ever-longer distances, and a steadily increasing number are now being exported to non-EU countries., The EU has long prided itself on its high animal welfare standards, and has had legislation on animals during transport since 1991. In 2005 the commission introduced regulations on animal transport that were far ahead of the rest of the world at the time. A European parliamentary resolution last year stated: “The EU is where animal welfare is most respected and defended, and it is an example for the rest of the world.”, This week the Guardian’s Animals Farmed series is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled over the last fifty years., Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks. , Every day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals. , And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down., We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. , But in 2018 Jørn Dohrmann, a Danish MEP, was asked to check how well the 2005 regulations were being implemented. His findings were damning. The parliamentary resolution that followed his report listed rough handling, inappropriate vehicles, overcrowding, high temperatures, failures to feed and water, uneven reporting and inspections, widely varying punishments for infringements (10 times higher fines in some states than in others), and no centralised record of operators that perpetrate systematic breaches of regulations., Dohrmann’s findings were just the latest of many investigations (including some by the commission) to find that regulations were being breached all over the place., “We have known for decades that something is wrong,” Dutch MEP Anja Hazecamp told the Guardian. “We really thought that with the new transport regulations things would start to change. But we see the same old problems as we saw in the 90s., “The member states say they want to do something, but they want a level playing field. And the commission says that they need member states to take action. So the same old status quo continues. This is why I am working together with other members of the Animal Welfare Intergroup to get an inquiry committee set up, to look into what is happening. We cannot wait for two more decades for things to change.”, “The commission is not doing its job,” Catherine Rowett MEP said. “It is true that quite a lot of good practice does happen as a result of the regulations, but they are not good enough – and they are not being enforced enough. Yes, it will mean more bureaucracy – but that’s what you have to have in order to make sure that profits don’t take precedence over welfare. It is absolutely crazy, it is bizarre that we can’t get this right.”, “What is lacking is political will at European commission and member state level to reconfigure the EU livestock sector to avoid long journeys,” said Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farming., Over two decades the trade has mushroomed at an alarming pace. The EU’s rapporteur states that “long and very long journeys are increasing”. The value of live animal exports across and out of the EU has trebled from $1bn (£763m) in 2000 to $3bn in 2018, according to UN Comtrade data., The reasons for this growth are complex. The liberation of cross-border trade in Europe, and the growing fragmentation of the farming system has meant that food producers have increasingly taken advantage of cost variations in different countries., So, for example, the Danes can produce piglets more cheaply than the Poles (they have bred their sows to give birth to more piglets than other countries) – but the Poles can rear them more cheaply (their labour costs and welfare requirements are both lower). The result is that five million piglets were trucked from Denmark to Poland in 2018 to be turned into Polish sausage., On top of this the EU has expanded east to include countries that have big rural populations and farming sectors, but limited processing facilities. The EU stamp has made their animals even more attractive to buyers, and Romania, Slovakia, Latvia and the Czech Republic are among those that have built up useful export sectors., The trend for fewer but bigger slaughterhouses is also a key factor. Last year Eurogroup for Animals looked into the sector as part of their call for a shift to a trade in meat and carcasses, rather than live animals. They found there were no centrally held figures – but that where numbers were available the pattern was clear., It’s a similar trend to the US – where the shift to larger slaughterhouses occurred much earlier. According to the Animal Welfare Institute, the number of slaughterhouses fell from nearly 8,000 in 1970 to just under 3,000 in 2018. And in the UK, where the Sustainable Food Trust has been monitoring the situation, the number of red meat abattoirs has fallen from about 1,900 in 1971 to 249 in 2018., But industry figures say that the costs involved in mobile slaughterhouses will make them impossible, given the expectations of the modern shopper. “People aren’t going to buy meat which is three times more expensive – and the labour costs for mobile slaughterhouses will be very high,” Rupert Claxton of international food consultancy Gira told the Guardian., “If you are a big commercial farmer wanting to put lamb into a supermarket chain, you need to keep the bacteria count down on the meat so you can have the shelf life that allows the long supply chain to work, so people can take it home and put it in their fridge for a week or 10 days before they want to eat it. In which case you’ve got to go to a big modern plant that can guarantee all those steps have been regulated and put in place. On-farm kill is not a realistic option in this country, or for most of Europe.”, The modern shopper’s expectation of cheap meat, plus issues around labour shortages and regulatory demands, put huge pressure on producers, said Claxton, pointing out that in at least one supermarket chain you can currently buy a chicken for about £1.90 a kg., Hazekamp agrees. “As long as we continue to think that the production of food can’t cost anything, we will not solve this problem.”, She is currently pushing for a full official inquiry into the issue. In 2018 Hazekamp and colleagues asked for an inquiry committee to investigate whether the regulations were working. But, despite gathering more than the required number of signatures, the Conference of Presidents instead commissioned the implementation report. , But she believes things will be different this time. “The climate has certainly changed,” she told the Guardian. “Animal welfare is no longer a minor issue that can be ignored.”, Campaigners believe that under the new commission, headed by Ursula von der Leyen, things look different. “The new team are very different from their predecessors,” points out Joe Moran at the Eurogroup for Animals. “We are obviously dismayed at the growth of this trade, but we are also now more optimistic that new measures will be brought forward by the commission that will begin to address this problem.”, A spokesperson for the European commission for health and food safety told the Guardian: “The issue of animal transport is of a major concern for the European commission. Over the past three years the commission has audited member states on road and sea transport to non-EU countries, issued recommendations and is following up on the action plans presented by member states. The commission services are ultimately building evidence to move, if necessary, towards possible proceedings against member states who have systematic non-compliances.”something is wrong meps say eu is failing to regulate live animal exports", "label": 0}, "train-167": {"text": "\nHigh risk of injuries in Denmark's live piglet export trade, audit warns\n, Cheaper labour and welfare costs have driven animal exports from Denmark to Poland, but critics fear corners are being cut, \nBibi van der Zee and Wojciech Kość, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 11.08 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 20.02 EDT\n\n, The Danish government has been labelled “unsatisfactory” and “ineffective” in an audit of its ballooning piglet trade published today. , In 2008 3.2 million live pigs were exported from Denmark; by 2018 that number had risen to 9.6 million. But the government continued to carry out just 100 checks a year up until 2018, according to the audit, with just 0.4% of transports being checked., The report also found that even when transporters repeatedly violated the rules, there was no kind of fine or sanction. The report concludes that as a result, there was “an unnecessarily high risk that the pigs may be injured or have suffered injuries during transport”., In recent years Denmark has built up an industry in exporting piglets, and a particularly productive partnership with Poland. Danish pigs have been bred to produce large litters, so Danish piglets are cheaper than elsewhere in Europe. But regulations and labour costs are less onerous in Poland, so it is cheaper to rear and slaughter pigs there. As a result trade has increased, with Denmark exporting more than six million piglets to Poland in 2017., This week the Guardian’s Animals Farmed series is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled over the last fifty years., Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks. , Every day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals. , And those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down., We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. ,  The vast majority of those are weaners – piglets of between 10 and 12 weeks that have just been weaned from their mothers. They are shipped in multi-storied trucks of up to five floors, and by law each piglet is allotted 0.2 sq metres of space., At the maximum speeds allowed, according to Google maps, the driver could make it border to border in just under six hours. In reality, the trip would take eight hours or more. The piglets, who will still have been feeding from their mother not long before setting off, are not fed during the journey: they do have access to water though, as long as the driver remembers to keep the tank full., The average Danish sow can produce a world beating 33.3 piglets a year. In the US the average is 26.4, and in the UK indoor herds are averaging nearly 26., But the Poles can rear them more cheaply. Over the last few years the Danes have raised welfare and environmental standards for their pigs. But that has come, as the industry acknowledges, at a cost. As the former UK head of the Danish Agriculture and Food Council (DAFC), John Howard, explained in Global Meat News in 2014: “We would prefer to see more pigs finished in Denmark, but there are high environmental costs experienced by Danish farmers which are not shared by their colleagues south of the border in Germany.”, Labour costs are cheaper in Poland, and in recent years processing infrastructure has been built. The piglets arrive at Polish farms, are raised, fattened, slaughtered and turned into Polish sausages., And Poland has made the most of the opportunity. Since 2000, the country has built an entire pork industry, one of the largest in the EU; it has its own national herd of about 10 million pigs, and imports more. It has invested in the processing equipment needed in order to turn those pigs into sausages. A lack of slaughter facilities has slowed many of its east European neighbours in developing a meat export industry, but Poland has spent more than $800m on processing equipment since 2000 and built modern abattoirs, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity., There are some who worry that this situation is not ideal for Polish farmers. “There are too few farms in Poland offering good stock for fattening. Farmers that want to specialise in pork but don’t want to breed pigs face the dilemma of where to source their piglets, often in batches of 1,000 or more. Foreign breeders can meet that demand,” said Martyna Batorska from the Warsaw Life Sciences University., “Polish pig farms are small and breed pigs in closed cycle, which is difficult, is too expensive and requires experience and time. In order to keep, say, 300 piglets for fattening, you need to have and take care of sows. Then you need to be able to maintain the right conditions for piglets after they’re born,” Batorska said. “It’s all very difficult. Much simpler just to buy piglets,” she added., “In Poland, farmers breed piglets only when they specialise in Polish breeds or if they’ve specialised in closed cycle pig farming, but those are few and far between,” said Maksymilian Zaręba, a farmer living near Pułtusk in the Warsaw province., And the piglets? The trade from Denmark is now attracting closer attention after Animal Welfare Denmark (AWD) obtained official veterinary records and published the fact that the monitoring bodies were carrying out just 100 checks a year on export vehicles. “That has now increased to about 250 a month,” said Ditte Erichsen, a vet specialising in transport who works with AWD. The journey logs for long transports showed that the monitoring bodies had found hundreds of violations, “but despite finding many violations, the inspectors had never reported anyone to the police”., But still, she said, it is nearly impossible to get data on the journey. “No one keeps records, that we’ve been able to find, about mortality rates, for example. You have young animals, travelling without food, and in some cases without water. But we really know nothing about them.”, “Polish companies importing piglets must meet all standards for transport of live animals. If those standards are higher in the source markets, such as in Denmark or the Netherlands, then they must meet those standards. It is better conditions than animal rights activists want people to see,” said a manager at one of the piglet-importing companies, speaking on condition of anonymity., The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) told the Guardian it has cooperated closely with the Danish auditor general (Rigsrevisionen) in investigating the long haul transport of pigs. , “The issues raised and the points of critique in the general auditor’s report are lessons to learn from. Since the summer of 2018, when the DVFA became aware that we did not systematically follow up on the logs, administrative procedures and control routines were amended to safeguard the conditions for transported pigs. Furthermore the number of physical controls of the pigs wellbeing as well as the standards of vehicles has been increased significantly.”, Christian Fink Hansen, director at SEGES Danish Pig Research Centre, part of the DAFC, told the Guardian: “Meat production and export is of great importance to the Danish economy and creates a large number of jobs, so it is the aim of the Danish pig sector that as many pigs as possible are raised and slaughtered in Denmark. Because of the superior health status and genetics there is however a great demand for Danish pigs from other countries. It is a shared goal for farmers and transport companies that the pigs are transported in a safe manner, so they arrive in best possible condition and good health. All transport of animals from Denmark must comply with EU regulations for transport of live animals.”, He added: “Denmark is a small country with a large production of livestock, so it is only natural that part of the production is sold outside the country. If you look at larger European countries, then a transport of piglets from Denmark to Poland easily compares to a transport within the country in, for instance, Sweden or Italy. So just looking at cross-border transport gives a somewhat biased picture.”high risk of injuries in denmarks live piglet export trade audit warns", "label": 0}, "train-168": {"text": "\nFracking protester's sentence reduced by court of appeal\n, Judges say greater leniency should be shown in cases of non-violent civil disobedience, \nAmy Walker, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 08.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Jan 2020 17.15 EST\n\n, A fracking protester’s sentence has been reduced by the court of appeal, which said greater leniency should be shown in convictions for non-violent civil disobedience., Katrina Lawrie, 41, was found guilty of contempt of court in June last year for breaching an injunction that banned trespassers blocking access to the energy firm Cuadrilla’s site on Preston New Road in Lancashire., On Thursday, Lawrie’s suspended prison sentence was reduced from two months to four weeks, after the court ruled her human rights were not taken fully into account by a judge., Passing the ruling, Lord Justice Leggatt said greater clemency should be given in response to acts of civil disobedience than in dealing with other acts of unlawful disobedience., “A person who engages in acts of civil disobedience establishes a moral difference between herself and ordinary law-breakers which it is right to take into account in determining what punishment is deserved,” he added., “The fact that such a protester is generally – apart from their protest activity – a law-abiding citizen, there is reason to expect that less severe punishment is necessary to deter such a person from further law-breaking.”, Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface., The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled., In England, the government placed a moratorium on fracking in November 2019 after protests, legal challenges and planning rejections. A year earlier, the energy company Cuadrilla was forced to stop work at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after fracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011. In March 2019 the high court ruled that the government's fracking guidelines were unlawful because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking., Lawrie, who had camped at the Little Plumpton site near Blackpool for two years, was sentenced in September after taking part in a “lock-on” protest in July 2018., Her fellow protesters Chris Wilson and Lee Walsh were both given a four-week suspended sentence. Lawrie was given a longer sentence because she had also stood in front of a delivery lorry on two separate occasions., However, the court of appeal ruled that despite her “complete lack of contrition”, Lawrie’s imprisonment was not justified and the appropriate penalty should be the same as for the contempt committed by the other campaigners., Lord Justice Underhill, also presiding over the hearing, said: “The court attach great weight to the right of peaceful protest, even where this causes disruption to others.”, The campaigners had applied to have key parts of the injunction obtained by Cuadrilla – which also prohibited protesters from “conspiring to interfere with the supply chain” by preventing trucks from entering the site – removed. However, in December, the company itself applied to withdraw those parts of the injunction., The court also granted permission for the protesters to appeal against the finding in the original case that they should pay Cuadrilla’s legal fees – which could be in the region of £70,000., They will argue at a hearing in the coming weeks that the ruling breaches their human right to a fair trial and access to the courts., A further argument that Lawrie, Walsh and Wilson should not have been convicted because an anti-protest injunction imposed on the site was too vague was rejected by the court., Cuadrilla was forced to stop work at the site in November, weeks before the licence was due to expire, after a scientific study warned it was not possible to rule out “unacceptable” consequences for those living near fracking sites.fracking protesters sentence reduced by court of appeal", "label": 0}, "train-169": {"text": "\nAnts run secret farms on English oak trees, photographer discovers\n, Brown ants herd and milk pale giant oak aphids, building barns for them from moss and beetle exoskeleton, \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 07.53 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Jan 2020 13.55 EST\n\n, Britain has a new farmed animal, which is kept in barns, milked and moved between high and low pastures – but not by humans., The pale giant oak aphid, Stomaphis wojciechowskii, has lived undiscovered for thousands of years on English oak trees, where it has been looked after by brown ants., In return for plentiful supplies of honeydew – the sugary water excreted by the aphid – the ants herd the aphids, keeping them safe in “barns” they build on tree trunks from mosses, lichens and the exoskeletons of beetles., “It’s beautifully complex,” said Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of Buglife. “It is farming – they are milking the animals, moving them from high to low pastures and building shelters for them when there’s not enough protection.”, The giant aphid – its lance-like mouth is up to twice as long as its 5-7mm body – has remained unnoticed for so long because it is mostly nocturnal and so well protected by the brown ant, Lasius brunneus., If the aphids are disturbed at one of their tree-trunk shelters, the ants immediately evacuate their “flock”, carrying the smallest individuals in their jaws and hustling the larger aphids down to the ants’ underground shelters., The ants keep the aphids underground during severe weather. In summer, when the sap rises, the ants march the aphids up the tree trunk to ensure they are well-fed and can provide the ants with sweet honeydew., Britain has two other species of giant aphid but the pale giant oak aphid was not expected to be found here after it was identified as a new species in central and eastern Europe by mitochondrial DNA analysis in 2012., But photographer and naturalist Julian Hodgson spotted the unusual creature accompanied by several brown ant bodyguards while searching for barkflies in Monks Wood national nature reserve, an ancient woodland near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Specimens were identified by entomologists in Poland and at the Natural History Museum., Stomaphis wojciechowskii has since been found at five other sites in north-west Cambridgeshire, including Woodwalton Fen and Holme Fen nature reserves., Further analysis suggests the giant aphid is not a new arrival but diverged from its central European relatives 30,000 years ago., In the paper reporting its discovery in the British Journal of Entomology and Natural History, Hodgson and his co-authors said it was “short-sighted” that no aphid species had been given formal conservation status or protection in Britain., Shardlow said further work needed to be done to establish the giant aphid’s distribution but it was likely to be rare because the brown ant upon which it is completely dependent is “nationally notable”., “These types of giant aphid are all very special and are rarely seen,” said Shardlow. “Their life history is inspiring and we do need more people to study wild aphids so that we can understand which species are threatened and endangered., “Just because something is an aphid doesn’t mean it can’t be a conservation priority.”ants run secret farms on english oak trees photographer discovers", "label": 0}, "train-170": {"text": "\nGreta Thunberg at Davos: 'Our demands have been completely ignored' – video\n, Greta Thunberg says the World Economic Forum has completely ignored the climate movement’s demands on fossil fuel divestment this week. , The 17-year-old activist also said that Steven Mnuchin’s comments that she should go to college and study economics had 'no effect' on her, Source: Reuters, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 06.54 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Jan 2020 11.43 EST\n\ngreta thunberg at davos our demands have been completely ignored video", "label": 0}, "train-171": {"text": "\nZero-carbon hydrogen injected into gas grid for first time in groundbreaking UK trial\n, Blend of hydrogen and natural gas is being used to heat homes and faculty buildings at Keele University, \nJessica Murray, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 05.07 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Jan 2020 05.10 EST\n\n, Zero-carbon hydrogen has been injected into a UK gas network for the first time in a groundbreaking trial that could help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions., The 20% hydrogen and natural gas blend is being used to heat 100 homes and 30 faculty buildings at Keele University in Staffordshire. Unlike natural gas, when hydrogen is burned it produces heat and water as opposed to carbon dioxide., “Heat hasn’t been particularly decarbonised to date and it’s a very big challenge,” said Lorna Millington, the future networks manager at Cadent, the gas distribution network that led the £7m HyDeploy project. “The aim was to turn the theoretical evidence into something real and tangible that the consumers within the Keele network are now getting to experience every day.”, Heating homes and businesses accounts for half of the UK’s energy consumption and a third of its carbon dioxide emissions. Rolling the 20% hydrogen blend out across the country could save about 6m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, the equivalent of taking 2.5m cars off the road., The hydrogen is captured using an electrolyser, which runs electricity through water to split it back into hydrogen and oxygen. This can then be injected into existing modern gas networks, with no need for customers to change appliances or pipework., The Health and Safety Executive granted the project exemption in 2018 from the current 0.1% limit on hydrogen in the UK gas network after an extensive examination of evidence to ensure it would be safe. Keele University was identified as an ideal location, because it owns and operates a private gas network that can be isolated from the main network., Two years of preparation involved gas safety checks on all buildings in the trial, laboratory tests on gas appliances and research on the effect of hydrogen on materials found in the gas network., All appliances sold after 1996 must be able to sustain 23% hydrogen under current regulations. “The materials we use in our network are actually more than capable of dealing with the levels of hydrogen that we were looking at,” said Millington., The trial will run until July and if successful a pilot will be rolled out in the north-east to deliver the 20% hydrogen blend to 670 domestic and commercial properties in Winlaton, Gateshead., Mark Horsley, the chief executive officer at Northern Gas Networks, said: “We’re really excited about the opportunity. There is a strong groundswell for decarbonisation, and I think opportunities for each individual home to contribute to that is quite powerful.”, The pilot, the first of its kind in the UK, would start in December and run for 10 months. Customers have already been notified about the upcoming change. “Early indications are that it’s going to be very positively received,” said Horsley., The project is part of global exploration into the potentials of a “hydrogen economy”, in which the gas could also be used to generate electricity and produce heat with benefits for transport, heavy industry and domestic energy use., The energy needed to produce hydrogen from water can be provided by solar, hydro or wind power to produce “green hydrogen”, but there are challenges in doing so at scale., It still may be some time before the technology can be rolled out nationally, but “the 20% is a massive step forward for us as an industry and for the UK in achieving that net zero goal”, Horsley said.hydrogen uk gas grid keele university", "label": 0}, "train-172": {"text": "\n‘Hypocrisy’: 90% of UK-Africa summit’s energy deals were in fossil fuels\n, Exclusive: Almost £2bn went to oil and gas despite a UK pledge to support cleaner energy in African countries , \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 03.27 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Jan 2020 05.29 EST\n\n, More than 90% of the £2bn in energy deals struck at this week’s UK-Africa investment summit were for fossil fuels, despite a government commitment to “support African countries in their transition to cleaner energy”., Prime Minister Boris Johnson opened the summit on Monday, citing the climate emergency: “We all breathe the same air, we live beneath the same sky, and we all suffer when carbon emissions rise and the planet warms.”, But the commercial energy deals revealed later were dominated by oil and gas production. The official UK government statement on the summit and a press release failed to mention these, citing only the far smaller support for clean energy. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the “hypocrisy of the government’s position is breath-taking”., Johnson also announced that UK taxpayers’ money would no longer support overseas coal-fired power plants and coal mining. Yet MPs on the environmental select committee reported in 2019 that “UK Export Finance (UKEF) has not supported a coal project since 2002”. , A report by Greenpeace and Newsnight also found that UKEF spent billions of pounds abroad supporting fossil fuel projects that will emit an estimated 69 million tonnes of carbon a year., The UK will host a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow in November, at which nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions to avoid a disastrous 3o-4oC rise in global temperatures., The five oil and gas deals announced after the summit are worth £2.1bn, led by oil company Tullow investing £1.2bn in continued oil production in Kenya. The other fossil fuel contracts span the continent from Nigeria to Mozambique and Tunisia to Cote D’Ivoire. In contrast, just £161m in deals – 8% of the total – were related to clean energy, the biggest being for £80m of solar-powered irrigation pumps for Uganda and £50m to help build a solar farm in Kenya., Before the summit, Lucas asked ministers which companies would attend, but the Department of Trade refused to reveal the names, citing “commercial interests”., “Now we know why the government was so secretive,” said Lucas. “The hypocrisy of the government’s position is breathtaking. It boasts of its green credentials one minute, and then hosts an investment summit which sees billions being invested in carbon-intensive industries in Africa. This government’s promises on climate action are completely hollow., “As hosts of this year’s UN climate summit, the UK needs to show international leadership and bring other countries with us. We can’t do that while UK money and business is supporting dirty energy around the world.”, A spokesman for the Department for International Trade (DIT) said: “The UK is committed to tackling climate change and supporting African countries in their transition to cleaner energy. Less than one-third of the total £6.5bn in deals were in oil and gas.”, At the summit, Johnson said the UK would help African nations “extract and use oil and gas in the cleanest, greenest way possible”, while also delivering “an electro-convulsive lightning bolt through our renewables industry”., Other deals struck at the summit included a total of £170m for aircraft and airports and £224m for a new Kenyan gold mine. The biggest deal was £3.2bn for Bombardier to construct and operate two monorail lines in Cairo, Egypt., The UK taxpayer is directly funding £50m of clean energy projects, including energy storage batteries and energy-efficient housing. “The government is stepping up our offer to work with African countries to unlock their massive renewable energy potential,” said the DIT spokesman., Nick Dearden, director of campaign group Global Justice Now, said: “The supposedly transformative £6.5bn UK investment in Africa includes oil, gas, gold mining and airlines. So much for fostering ‘climate-friendly’ development., “In the 19th century, the ‘scramble for Africa’ was carefully disguised as a humanitarian project.

He also said the numbers would make a “decent sound bite”, and acknowledged that wildfire emissions estimates could vary based on what kind of trees were burning but picked the ones that he said would make “a good story”., Scientists who reviewed the exchanges said that at best Reilly used unfortunate language and the department cherry-picked data to help achieve their pro-industry policy goals; at worst he and others exploited a disaster and manipulated the data., The emails add to concerns that the Trump administration is doing industry’s bidding rather than pursuing the public interest. Across agencies, top positions are filled by former lobbyists, and dozens of investigative reports have revealed agencies working closely with major industries to ease pollution, public health and safety regulations., A USGS spokesperson said Reilly’s emails were “intended to instruct the subject matter expert to do the calculations as quickly as possible based on the best available data at the time and provide results in clear understandable language that the Secretary could use to effectively communicate to a variety of audiences.” The agency added that it “stands by the integrity of its science”, When forests burn, they do emit greenhouse gases. But one expert said the numbers the interior department put forth are significant overestimates. They say logging wouldn’t necessarily help prevent or lessen wildfires. On the contrary, logging could negate the ability of forests to absorb carbon dioxide humans are emitting at record rates., It is climate that is responsible for the size and severity of these fires, Chad Hanson, a California-based forest ecologist who co-founded the John Muir Project and who has opposed logging after fires, called the strategizing revealed in the emails a “blatant political manipulation of science”., Mark Harmon, a professor emeritus at Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, said while it’s normal for the department to want to quantify emissions from fires, it’s unclear whether they began the process with a particular figure in mind., “Gin-up is an unfortunate phrase to be sure, but it might have been a very imprecise way to ask for an estimate. It certainly does not inspire confidence,” Harmon said., He said the resulting quotes from top officials and press releases from the department are “about what you would expect from agencies trying to justify actions they already decided to take with minimal analysis”., Harmon added that “the effect of logging on fires is highly variable,” depending on how it is done and the weather conditions., Not long after the interior department came up with its carbon emission estimates from the 2018 California wildfires, Trump issued an executive order instructing federal land managers to significantly increase the amount of timber they harvest. This fall, he also proposed allowing logging in Alaska’s Tongass national forest, the largest intact temperate rainforest in North America., Trump has also tweeted multiple times about wildfires, saying they are caused by bad land management or environmental laws that make water unavailable., Monica Turner, a fire ecology scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said “it is climate that is responsible for the size and severity of these fires”., An Interior department spokesperson said the department’s role is to follow the laws and use the best science and that it continues “to work to best understand and address the impacts of an ever-changing climate.”, Agency officials started emphasizing wildfire emissions data as a talking point as early as August 2018., In an email chain that month, Reilly was asked by interior’s former deputy chief of staff Downey Magallanes to sign off on a statement that fires in 2018 had emitted 95.6m tons of CO2., “Interesting statistics,” Reilly responded, noting that emissions would vary based on the types of trees on the land. “…We assumed woodlands mix since we don’t currently have details on the overall land cover types involved. Any variance to the fuel type will still leave it in the range to make the comparison, however. I’ll use this one if you don’t object. Makes a good story.”, Reilly, who was confirmed to his position in April 2018, later asked career scientists at the agency for updated numbers, according to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act., “I need to get a number for total CO2 releases for the recent CA fires and a comparison against emissions for all energy in US … Tasker from the boss; back to me ASAP,” he said on 10 October 2018. His boss at the time was the former interior secretary Ryan Zinke., The job fell to Doug Beard, the director of the National Climate Adaptation Science Center, and Bradley Reed, an associate program coordinator in the Geographic Analysis and Monitoring Program, who responded with numbers from his team that afternoon., In November 2018, Reilly once again asked for the same estimates of carbon dioxide generated by two devastating fires that fall in California – the Camp and Woolsey fires., “The Secretary likes to have this kind of information when he speaks with the media,” Reilly said in a 16 November email to David Applegate, the associate director for natural hazards., Applegate directed Beard to get the numbers, and Reilly chimed in, asking Beard: “Can you have the scientists gin up an estimate on the total CO2 equivalent releases are so far for the current 2 fires in CA?” He said he wanted to compare the figures to the carbon pollution caused by transportation in California. , “That would make a decent sound bite the Sec could use to put some perspective on it,” said Reilly., Just a week earlier, the ferocious Camp fire had destroyed Paradise, California, killing dozens and becoming the deadliest wildfire in the state’s history. The scenes detailed were horrific., Conservatives have insisted that the wildfires are happening because environmentalists have overzealously encouraged the conservation of forests. Trump has battled with California – the face of the American progressive movement he opposes – over a multitude of other issues, including the state’s longstanding climate policy of requiring new cars to go farther on less fuel., The new emails show communications staffers and political appointees using government scientists as foot soldiers in those battles., Now, under the leadership of the former lobbyist David Bernhardt, the agency has sought to remove consideration of climate change from many of its decisions, while expanding oil and gas drilling on federal land. Multiple whistleblowers have accused the department of stifling climate science., Bernhardt in a May 2019 hearing told lawmakers there are no laws obligating him to combat climate change., After Reilly asked his staff to calculate the wildfire emissions numbers in November, an interior spokeswoman emailed him asking for the same information so she could put out a statement from Zinke. A few days later, the agency published a press release on Zinke’s behalf, with the title “New Analysis Shows 2018 California Wildfires Emitted as Much Carbon Dioxide as an Entire Year’s Worth of Electricity.”, “There’s too much dead and dying timber in the forest, which fuels these catastrophic fires,” Zinke said. “Proper management of our forests, to include small prescribed burns, mechanical thinning, and other techniques, will improve forest health and reduce the risk of wildfires, while also helping curb the carbon emissions.”, As wildfire experts have repeatedly explained, you can’t log or even ‘rake’ our way out of this mess, Hanson, the forest and fire ecologist, said that in addition to using the government data for political purposes, the department numbers overstated the carbon emissions from forest fires while downplaying emissions from fossil fuels., He said that the carbon emissions numbers generated by USGS and released to the public were an “overestimate” that “can’t be squared with empirical data” from field studies of post-wildfire burn sites in California. Other scientists the Guardian spoke with did not dispute the government’s data, but did find fault with the way it was presented to the public., “The comparison of fire to electrical emissions in California was not explained or justified”, said Harmon, the Oregon State University scientist. “Picking other sectors would have left an entirely different image in the reader’s mind…If the comparison had been made nationally it would have been found that fire related emissions of carbon dioxide were equivalent to 1.7% of fossil fuel related emissions. So it is hard to escape the conclusion that some cherry picking was going on.”, Jayson O’Neill, the deputy director of the Western Values Project, said the emails are another example of the administration “trying to find ways to tell a story to achieve industry goals”., “As wildfire experts have repeatedly explained, you can’t log or even ‘rake’ our way out of this mess,” O’Neill said. “The Trump administration and the interior department are pushing mystical theories that are false in order to justify gutting public land protections to advance their pro-industry and lobbyist dominated agenda.”trump administration wildfire science promote logging california emissions", "label": 0}, "train-174": {"text": "\nDavid Attenborough to appear at citizens' climate assembly\n, People from across Britain will join TV host to discuss ways to cut emissions to zero by 2050, \nSandra Laville, \n\nFri 24 Jan 2020 02.00 EST\n\n, Sir David Attenborough will address members of the public who are taking part in the UK’s first climate assembly this weekend., The TV presenter and naturalist will appear in Birmingham, where the 110 members are meeting to address how to reduce emissions to zero by 2050, to thank them for taking part., “I am grateful to the 110 people from all corners of the United Kingdom who are giving up their weekends to take part in this very important discussion,” Attenborough said., “These people have been picked to represent our population as a whole, they come from all walks of life, and together they will deliberate carefully on behalf of us all.

Another five buses will be introduced in Southampton., According to tests, audited by manufacturer Pall, and being assessed by the University of Southampton, the bus removed approximately 65g of pollutants from the air and cleaned 3.2 million cubic metres of the city’s air., David Brown, the chief executive of Go-Ahead group, which owns the BlueStar bus in Southampton, said the system had exceeded their expectations and he hoped that councils would help fund more routes. The trial cost the operator about £100,000 and each bus conversion is around £20,000., “We think it’s part of the solution to air pollution, along with getting people on public transport anyway,” he said. The buses have the cleanest Euro VI engines, whose nitrogen oxides emissions are now less than a single diesel car, “so it’s a double-whammy,” Brown added., “For all local authorities who have an issue with air pollution and clean air zones, I genuinely believe this is part of the solution,” Brown said. “These are small pilots, but if you could put it on every bus it would actually make a difference.”, He said the bill to convert Go-Ahead’s entire nationwide fleet would be around £100m.air filtering bus to launch across six regions in the uk", "label": 0}, "train-176": {"text": "UK households waste 4.5m tonnes of food each year, Report reveals total has fallen 7% in last three years, but says much more still needs to be done, Total food waste in the UK has fallen by the equivalent of 7% per person over the past three years, but individual households should still be doing more to reduce the 4.5m tonnes of food waste, the government’s waste advisory body has warned., The volume of food waste generated in the retail supply chain, the hospitality sector, and in homes stood at 9.5m tonnes in 2018, down from 10m tonnes in 2015 and 11.2m in 2007, according to a detailed study from the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)., But the 38-page report reveals that UK households still waste 4.5m tonnes of food a year that could have been eaten, worth £14bn. This amounts to £700 for an average family with children. Despite this progress – household food waste has fallen by 6%, from 7.1m tonnes to 6.6m tonnes over three years – the volume of food still wasted equates to 10bn edible meals, it points out.

Our friend had been good to us in life and there was no reason to assume that would change. Jim was a tree, a common alder, although given that alders are monoecious, or hermaphroditic, not the most appropriate moniker. He, or she, was named by our daughter Rosa, who often spent afternoons after school in Jim’s boughs, hugging the fissured grey trunk, as rough as an elephant. But despite being a similar age, with a similar lifespan, the alder didn’t long survive Rosa leaving home. Over several springs, its leaves became increasingly sparse and failed to unfurl properly. An orange stain appeared in cracks at the base of the trunk. Small branches began dying off, then larger ones. Last year Jim gave up the ghost altogether, a victim to alder dieback, the Phytophthora mould infection that is ravaging alders up and down the country., Leaving the tree was an experiment. What would happen in its afterlife? It was soon a favourite with the neighbourhood’s greater spotted woodpecker, but examining the dead tree now, I notice dozens of small holes drilled up its trunk and fringed with sawdust: wood wasp larvae, plausibly those of Xiphydria camelus, the alder wood wasp. They develop into an ominous but beautiful insect, roughly the same size as a common wasp but predominantly black, with wings beaded black, like stained-glass windows, a large head on a narrow neck, the black flanks of the abdomen inflected with white, and colourful legs hovering somewhere between rust and orange. The tail ends in a slightly curved ovipositor, which might be mistaken for a sting but is in fact a complex wonder of evolution used to insert eggs an inch or so into the wood of a dead or dying alder., Native but not common, these wasps have minor celebrity status, being the subject of a groundbreaking 1961 film by the naturalist Gerald Thompson, which unravelled the larvae’s nightmarish struggle against parasitical wasps and flies that hijack the wasp’s reproductive cycle.

The southern superb lyrebird, from Victoria and southern NSW, is estimated to have had 34% of where it lives burned., Across the country, the group found 19 birds had more than half their habitat seriously affected by fire. Another 58 had lost over a third of the area they live in., Sixteen of the most severely affected are endemic to tiny Kangaroo Island, the South Australian territory that scientists say appears the most devastated wildlife area., Sean Dooley, Birdlife Australia’s national public affairs manager, said it was shocking to think a resilient and successful wet-forest species such as the lyrebird could have become a threatened species in the space of a few weeks., “The word unprecedented is being used all the time, but in terms of the scope and breadth of the fires, they have taken out so much habitat that what we’re discovering is our worst nightmare,” he said.“As a one-off event it’s a disaster, but in a context of what is happening to our birds anyway, with so many under pressure from continuing land-clearing and the drought, it could be a knockout blow to a lot of species that have been suffering. The figures are actually frightening. It’s really shaken our hope that we can protect these species into the future, but we’re not giving up hope. There’s a lot of important things that can be done.”, It could be a knockout blow to a lot of species that have been suffering., BirdLife Australia’s head of research, James O’Connor, said the number of nationally threatened birds – 134 last year – might increase by more than 25%. “It’s staggering and tragic,” he said., O’Connor said no-one expected superb lyrebirds, which live in wet forests, to be so affected but climate change had played a role in drying areas that did not historically burn. “This is a whole new ball game, and we need to change our thinking about the scale of effort required to deal with it.”, The analysis is based on a comparison of the birds’ known habitat with maps of the fires. It uses data up to 7 January. Dooley said the assessment could worsen as fires continue to burn., Some of the threatened birds worst affected by fire had increased in number in recent years due to efforts by scientists and conservationists. The number of glossy black-cockatoo on Kangaroo Island rose from about 150 in the early 1990s to about 400 last year. Dooley said it lost an estimated 65% of its habitat in the fires and would be a “huge conservation challenge”., The Kangaroo Island subspecies of the southern emu wren, a tiny bird with a tail-feather bigger than its body, had 83% of its estimated habitat affected. Birdlife believes it may now be critically endangered., Dooley found a reason for slight optimism in the finding that no bird had lost 100% of its habitat. “There is hope that if we treat these species as they deserve, we can recover most or all of them, but it’s going to take immediate efforts that continue for decades,” he said., It would require controlling foxes and feral cats – predators that have much greater impact in fire affected areas – and herbivores that quickly eat regrowth, such as deer, horses and goats., Dooley said logging in the bushfire-affected area, as proposed by forestry groups, could have a devastating impact on bird recovery. “If we let the bush naturally regenerate, then the birds have a chance.”, The 19 birds that have had at least half of their habitat affected by fire are:, Kangaroo Island southern emu-wren, Kangaroo Island crimson rosella, Kangaroo Island little wattlebird, Kangaroo Island white-eared honeyeater, Kangaroo Island western whipbird, Kangaroo Island shy heathwren, Kangaroo Island brown-headed honeyeater, Kangaroo Island striated thornbill, Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoo, Southern rufous scrub-bird, Kangaroo Island New Holland honeyeater, Kangaroo Island brown thornbill, Kangaroo Island grey currawong, Kangaroo Island red wattlebird, Central superb lyrebird, Kangaroo Island spotted scrubwren, Kangaroo Island superb fairy-wren, Rockwarbler, Northern superb lyrebirdlyrebird threatened species scale bird habitat bushfires emerges", "label": 0}, "train-179": {"text": "\nAustralian bushfires will cause jump in CO2 in atmosphere, say scientists\n, Fires released vast amounts of carbon dioxide and reduced vegetation, pushing planet closer to point of no return, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nThu 23 Jan 2020 19.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 23 Jan 2020 19.04 EST\n\n, The devastating bushfires in Australia are likely to cause a jump in carbon concentrations in the atmosphere this year, a forecast suggests, bringing the world closer to 1.5C of global heating., The fires have not only released vast amounts of carbon dioxide and soot, but the unusual extent of the blazes means regrowth is likely to be slower than in previous years. That will reduce the amount of vegetation available to act as a carbon sink, meaning less carbon dioxide is removed from the air., Experts at the UK’s Met Office have predicted that this year will see another large rise in the carbon content of the atmosphere, which has been measured at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since 1958. They predict that carbon dioxide will peak at more than 417 parts per million in May, usually the highest point of the year for carbon concentrations, and settle to about 414ppm as the average for 2020., The predicted year-on-year rise of about 2.74ppm would be one of the biggest on record. Emissions from the Australian bushfires will make up one-fifth of the increase, according to the Met Office. Last year, scientists recorded the second biggest yearly increase on record, of 3.5ppm compared with 2018., The absorption of carbon dioxide by land ecosystems, such as vegetation and forests, is linked to swings in Pacific Ocean temperatures, the Met Office noted. Many regions become warmer and drier in years with a warmer tropical Pacific, limiting the ability of plants to grow and absorb carbon, while the risk of wildfires increases. That has contributed to the hot dry weather in Australia, making the bushfires more severe., Since the Mauna Loa records began, human activities have resulted in a yearly rise in the carbon content of the air. Some years have seen only a modest rise, but in recent years the rise has been stronger, despite global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions., Professor Richard Betts, of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: “The annual rate of rise isn’t perfectly even because there are fluctuations in the response of ecosystem carbon sinks, especially tropical forests. Overall, these are expected to be weaker than normal for the second year running. The year-to-year variability in the rate of rise of CO2 is affected more by the strength of ecosystem carbon sinks and sources than year-to-year changes in human-induced emissions. Nevertheless, anthropogenic emissions are still the overall driver of the long-term rise in concentrations.”, Each annual rise takes the planet closer to the crucial 450ppm threshold. That is regarded by scientists as the limit of safety, beyond which the impacts of climate change – droughts, floods, heatwaves, fiercer storms, and sea level rises – are likely to become much worse., “This analysis illustrates how feedback processes can accelerate the rise in greenhouse gas levels and hence the rate of warming,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “Global warming in Australia, western North America and many other parts of the world is increasing the risk and extent of wildfires, releasing ever more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Such feedback processes will lead to the exhaustion of our emissions budgets even more quickly than expected.

It sounds like a huge amount, but is still only a small proportion of the 1bn pieces of plastic that the chain has pledged to remove this year., Campaigners hailed the move as “simple logic” and “common sense”, asking why retailers had not done this sooner. Part of the answer is that they were not sure consumers would continue to respond to multibuy offers if the tins were not physically bound together, but trials appear to have produced positive results., Tesco’s move will apply only to tinned goods, leaving many other products still sheathed together in plastic multipacks, from vegetables and chocolate bars to drinks and bottles of shower gel., The company has said the move will not result in greater need for other types of packaging such as cardboard, and nor is there any need to substitute other materials in the packaging. That is positive: recent work by the Green Alliance has highlighted the dangers of simple substitution., Libby Peake, the head of resource policy at Green Alliance, said: “This contrasts with some of the other moves we’ve seen in the grocery sector where companies are sometimes replacing unnecessary single-use plastic items with equally unnecessary single-use items made from other materials.”, For instance, single-use thin plastic fruit bags are sometimes replaced with paper, which can have higher carbon impacts, and single-use plastic ready meal trays are being replaced with coated fibreboard, which is difficult to recycle. Single-use cutlery is being made from wood or compostable plastic, which the UK’s recycling infrastructure cannot handle., “This trend of substituting plastic for other materials, while maintaining the current disjointed packaging system, risks trading our current problems with plastic pollution for other environmental problems down the line,” said Peake. “An approach that tackles all unnecessary material use is a big part of what’s needed.”, Other retailers and consumer goods companies are also at work on cutting down their use of plastic. Greenpeace highlights Waitrose, Morrisons, Asda and Marks &amp; Spencer, which are trying out food dispensers and liquid refill stations. This is the best long-term solution, because any single-use packaging item – including paper or cardboard – uses resources and cannot always be recycled., Peake also wants to see more regulation from the government, as voluntary measures by companies will not produce the changes needed quickly enough. “A big part of the problem is that in the absence of government leadership, businesses are often adopting conflicting approaches,” she said. “In private discussions they admit they’re still competing on packaging innovations in unhelpful ways to gain market share. Government needs to intervene if that’s going to stop.”, Many retailers have targets on the “recyclability” of their plastic products, but recycling alone will not work, said Sander Defruyt, the lead on the new plastics economy at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “Globally, recycling rates are still very low: more than 40 years after the recycling symbol was introduced, less than 10% of plastic packaging is recycled. We cannot recycle our way out of the problems of plastic waste and pollution. More companies need to take action to eliminate the plastic we don’t need.”, More than 25 companies have banded together to invest $1bn over five years in projects to reduce plastic use. But that is a drop in the plastic-filled ocean relative to the profits that plastics help companies make annually., Green groups want all companies to go further. “It’s great that Tesco are getting rid of multipack plastic packaging that’s completely pointless, and are also pressuring their branded suppliers like Heinz and Branston to do the same,” said Fiona Nicholls, an oceans plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK. “This is such an easy, common-sense first step that all supermarkets should have done this long ago. We urge retailers to end the nonsense of double-plastic packaging on all products straight away and be bolder by introducing reusable and refillable packaging.”, • This article was amended on 24 January 2020.

The impact on most species not currently listed as threatened is yet to be assessed., Birdlife Australia estimates nearly 80 birds have lost at least a third of the area in which they live, and that the superb lyrebird may have plunged from being a common to a threatened species., Marsh said the threatened species committee planned to review the decision-making process for officially listing species as vulnerable or worse within the constraints of existing national environment laws. She said the protection offered to species after they were listed should also be reconsidered as the existing model of recovery planning had not worked. Fewer than 40% of nationally threatened species have recovery plans in place., She said she was encouraged by the level of goodwill between federal and state governments, scientists and conservationists following the fires, including the response by Sussan Ley, the federal environment minister, who has set up and met with an expert scientific panel to advise on what needed to be done., The federal government has allocated $50m in wildlife recovery funding, with a promise of more to come, and officials from across fire affected areas are due to meet on Tuesday to continue work on a national response., Marsh said the creation of a national scientific monitoring facility, proposed by fire scientists David Bowman and Ross Bradstock to fill critical gaps in bushfire knowledge, made some sense. She said it could include wildlife surveys., “I’ve been quite concerned about the way we monitor our biodiversity in Australia, it’s a huge job, and I think if we are going to understand the impact of fires that is a very interesting idea that needs consideration,” she said., Given not everything could be monitored, she said there would need to be clear priorities that would likely be defined by the 12m hectare bushfires. But she said it was important to consider “biodiversity arks”, key areas that had avoided the fires, as well as burned country., Marsh said it should utilise technology, including remote sensing and drones, as well as on-ground field work by scientists, Indigenous rangers and possibly community groups and citizen scientists. “I do believe that the importance of monitoring the impact of the fires will be a catalyst for doing this work,” she said. “It is very important that it be well designed and scientifically robust.”, While she backed the development of a national system, Marsh said monitoring the impact of the fires could not wait for a new system and needed to begin as soon as it was safe., An analysis by environment groups found the Coalition had cut funding for environmental programs, monitoring and staff by about 40% since being elected in 2013., Marsh said changes would be needed to the national environment laws, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity and Protection Act, which is being reviewed by businessman Graeme Samuel., Asked how successful the laws had been, she said the government’s state of the environment report, which among other things found climate change was altering the structure and function of Australia’s natural ecosystems and affecting heritage, economic activity and human wellbeing, “spoke for itself”., Marsh said the review of the laws should consider whether it was appropriate to adopt more advanced criteria used by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to assess whether an ecological community was threatened. , Government ministers including Ley last year stressed the review would focus on cutting “green tape”. Scientists have expressed hope it may now address the impact of the fires and what was needed to avoiding an extinction crisis that scientists said was worsening before the devastating fire season., Scientists last year said three native Australian species had become extinct in the past decade and another 17 could follow in the next 20 years. More than 1,800 Australian plants and animals are listed as threatened with extinction. Scientists warned in a letter to the government before the fires that this was likely to be an underestimate.australian government adviser urges threatened species overhaul after bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-182": {"text": "\nCourt to probe Carrie Symonds’ influence on PM after cancellation of badger cull\n, \nJamie Doward, \n\nSat 25 Jan 2020 12.35 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 25 Jan 2020 17.50 EST\n\n, The influence exerted on the prime minister by his partner, Carrie Symonds, will be explored in court after permission was granted last week for a judicial review into how the government came to pull a cull on badgers in Derbyshire., The case could embarrass Boris Johnson and raise questions about the government’s willingness to listen to its advisers when formulating policy., Symonds, a passionate animal rights defender and a patron of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, has, along with environment minister Zac Goldsmith, been a staunch critic of the cull that is operating in 10 counties., Last autumn the environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, ordered Natural England to scrap a cull in Derbyshire, where badgers are being vaccinated against TB, a decision warmly endorsed by Symonds and Goldsmith. The decision came three weeks after Symonds was briefed by Dominic Dyer, head of the Badger Trust, which opposes the cull., The farmers union, the NFU, believes this meeting played a key role in the government ignoring scientific advice in favour of retaining the cull and sought a judicial review to determine how the decision was reached., Last week the High Court confirmed the judicial review could proceed, meaning the NFU’s lawyers will be able to examine in court the basis on which the government pulled the cull., Last month the NFU vice-president, Stuart Roberts, said: “We think that what the secretary of state did is unlawful, and that is why we’re launching this legal challenge. Alongside the Derbyshire farmers, we’re asking the court to rule that the direction issued to Natural England should be overturned., “It’s come to light that before the secretary of state made her decision, her expert veterinary and scientific advisers told her that a licence should be issued to the Derbyshire area, to prevent the spread of bovine TB. It remains our view that any policy decisions must be based on science and evidence.”, Villiers has confirmed that Downing Street was involved in the decision to pull the cull. Earlier this month she told the Farmers Guardian: “Certainly we engaged with No 10 on the decision on Derbyshire, yes.”, Villiers said that she was not given a specific “direction” by the prime minister’s office, but admitted a “conversation had taken place” about whether a cull was suitable in a zone where badgers were being vaccinated., Dyer defended Symonds’ role in bringing the Derbyshire cull to Johnson’s attention. He told the Observer: “I relayed my concerns to the prime minister in an open letter on the need to stop the badger cull in Derbyshire and other counties and I am pleased to see that Carrie made sure this reached him in Downing Street., “It is completely legitimate for the Badger Trust or any other organisation opposing the badger cull policy to seek to engage with the prime minister in this way, particularly on such a hugely controversial, costly and cruel policy.”, The government was expected by now to have published figures confirming that more than 40,000 badgers were shot last year in 43 cull zones. This would put the total number of badgers killed under the government cull policy since 2013 at more than 110,000. But the figures have yet to be released., There is speculation that Goldsmith – who is now in the House of Lords – may be made environment secretary in an impending reshuffle., If so, farmers’ groups may seek reassurances that the government remained committed to the cull, which they believe is a crucial weapon in restricting the spread of TB., A Defra spokeswoman said: “We have been notified about this legal challenge and we cannot comment on ongoing judicial proceedings.Bovine TB remains one of the greatest animal health threats to the UK, and the decision to pause the cull programme in Derbyshire will let us look at how the cull and existing vaccination projects in that area have worked together.”court probe carrie symonds influence boris johnson badger cull", "label": 0}, "train-183": {"text": "\nRace to exploit the world’s seabed set to wreak havoc on marine life\n, \nRace to exploit the world’s seabed set to wreak havoc on marine life\n, New research warns that ‘blue acceleration’ – a global goldrush to claim the ocean floor – is already impacting on the environment., \nRobin McKie Science Editor, \n\nSat 25 Jan 2020 09.10 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 25 Jan 2020 13.39 EST\n\n, The scaly-foot snail is one of Earth’s strangest creatures. It lives more than 2,300 metres below the surface of the sea on a trio of deep-sea hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. Here it has evolved a remarkable form of protection against the crushing, grim conditions found at these Stygian depths. It grows a shell made of iron., Discovered in 1999, the multi-layered iron sulphide armour of Chrysomallon squamiferum – which measures a few centimetres in diameter – has already attracted the interest of the US defence department, whose scientists are now studying its genes in a bid to discover how it grows its own metal armour., The researchers will have to move quickly, however, for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has just added the snail to its list of threatened species. German and Chinese industrial groups have revealed plans to explore the seabed around two of the three vents that provide homes for scaly-foot snails. Should they proceed, and mine the seabed’s veins of metals and minerals, a large chunk of the snail’s home base will be destroyed and the existence of this remarkable little creature will be threatened., “On land, we are already exploiting mineral resources to the full,” says Jean-Baptiste Jouffray, of Stockholm University. “At the same time, the need for rare elements and metals is becoming increasingly important to supply green technologies such as wind and solar power plants., “And so industrialists are looking to the seabed where it is now technologically and economically feasible to mine for minerals. Hence the arrival of threats to creatures like the scaly-foot snail.”, Jouffray is the lead author of an analysis, published last week in the journal One Earth, which involved synthesising 50 years of data from shipping, drilling, aquaculture, and other marine industries and which paints an alarming picture of the impact of future exploitation of the oceans., This threat comes not just from seabed mining – which is set to expand dramatically in coming years – but from fish farming, desalination plant construction, shipping, submarine cable laying, cruise tourism and the building of offshore wind farms., This is “blue acceleration”, the term that is used by Jouffray and his co-authors to describe the recent rapid rise in marine industrialisation, a trend that has brought increasing ocean acidification, marine heating, coral reef destruction, and plastic pollution in its wake. As they state in their paper: “From the shoreline to the deep sea, the blue acceleration is already having major social and ecological consequences”., Another illustration of blue acceleration is provided by seabed grabbing, state the authors. Article 76 of the UN convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS) allows countries to claim seabed that lies beyond the 200 miles of a nation’s exclusive economic zone. Since the first claim under Article 76 was made in 2001, 83 countries have made submissions. Put together, these claims account for more than 37 million sq km of seabed, an area more than twice the size of Russia., Many seabed grabbers include small island states that are trying to become large ocean states in the process. For example, the Cook islands in the South Pacific has claimed an area of seabed that is 1,700 times its land surface. “The extension of the continental shelf is therefore not only transforming the geopoltical landscape, it is also substantially shrinking the area designated as the common heritage of humankind,” states the report., Examples of the conflicts that could ensue because of the blue acceleration include the disruption of key fish stocks by drilling for gas or oil offshore; pipelines that prevent trawl fishing; and offshore wind farms that disturb tourism., Norway provides a stark demonstration of likely future conflicts. It aims to bring about fivefold rises both in salmon farming and cruise tourism in its waters over coming years while also building more and more offshore wind farms and more and more offshore gas and oil platforms. Seabed mining for minerals is also scheduled to begin. This saturation of ocean space renders Norwegian waters as being highly vulnerable to shocks, states the report., The South China Sea is another potential flashpoint. It is a key gateway in the region’s network of undersea telecommunication cables; a third of the world’s shipping passes through it; while half the world’s fishing boats operate in its waters – which are disputed variously by China, Malaysia, Vietnam and others. Should armed conflict break out here over any of these issues, there would be a far-reaching impact on the world’s economy., “The relevance of the ocean for humanity’s future is undisputed,” states the report. “However, addressing the diversity of claims, their impacts and their interactions, will require effective governance.”, To achieve this, the authors call for greater accountability to be imposed on those financing the fundamental changes that are now being made to Earth’s oceans. These include both banks and governments., In addition, the vulnerability of small island states needs to be addressed, it adds: “Navigating the blue acceleration in a just and sustainable way requires particular emphasis on the implications of increased ocean use across the globe – and how these claims could have an impact on the economic safety and wellbeing of vulnerable communities and social groups.” race for seabed threat to oceans", "label": 0}, "train-184": {"text": "\nCacao not gold: ‘chocolate trees’ offer future to Amazon tribes\n, \nCacao not gold: ‘chocolate trees’ offer future to Amazon tribes\n, In Brazil’s largest indigenous reserve thousands of saplings have been planted as an alternative to profits from illegal gold mining, \nDom Phillips in Waikás, Yanomami indigenous reserve, Brazil, \n\nSat 25 Jan 2020 08.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 28 Jan 2020 05.17 EST\n\n, The villagers walk down the grassy landing strip, past the wooden hut housing the health post and into the thick forest, pointing out the seedlings they planted along the way. For these Ye’kwana indigenous men, the skinny saplings, less than a metre high, aren’t just baby cacao trees but green shoots of hope in a land scarred by the violence, pollution and destruction wrought by illegal gold prospecting. That hope is chocolate., “We want to plant and develop income for the community,” says Júlio Ye’kwana, 39, president of the Ye’kwana people’s Wanasseduume association, which came up with the idea. “And it is not destructive for the forest.”, In the last two years, thousands of Theobroma cacao trees have been planted near Waikás and other villages in the remote Yanomami indigenous reserve. The saplings were planted within the forest because cacao likes shade, an idea borrowed from agroforestry techniques successfully used for cacao elsewhere in the Amazon., Villagers hope that within a few years rich, organic chocolate will be produced from the golden cacao fruit these trees bear. The project – run by the reserve’s indigenous associations Wanasseduume and Hutukara with Brazilian non-profit group Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) – is ambitious, but experts say it is based on a potential commercial reality., Located in the far north of the Brazilian Amazon, Yanomami is Brazil’s biggest indigenous reserve, spread over 9.6 million hectares (23.7m acres). But its wild, mountainous forests are overrun by an estimated 20,000 wildcat goldminers, called garimpeiros., Ye’kwana and Yanomami indigenous leaders called for the garimpeiros to be expelled with a letter and group photo later shared by actor Leonardo DiCaprio., But the country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has claimed that indigenous people really yearn for white society’s consumer lifestyles, said the Yanomami reserve is too big for its population and may be sued for racism by the Brazilian Indigenous People’s Association after comments during a Facebook Live broadcast this week. “The indigenous changed, they are evolving,” he said. “Indigenous are increasingly becoming human beings just like us.”, “The president says indigenous people are poor. We are not poor. Nobody goes hungry here,” says Júlio Ye’kwana. “We eat for free.”, The Guardian was invited to visit by the Hutukara Yanomami Association, founded by Davi Kopenawa, a leader and shaman who fought to create the reserve with photographer Claudia Andujar and non-profit group Survival International., Five villages from both tribes are participating in the cacao project. Cacao trees are native in this area, but around 3,000 new seedlings have been planted to boost production, with 7,000 expected by the end of 2021., Edmilson Estevão shins up a mature cacao tree to bring down some of the heavy yellow fruit. Inside each thick shell is a sticky cluster of seeds, packed in a sweet, delicious, pale paste. These are dried and roasted to make chocolate., “One tree like this can bear up to 20 fruit,” says Estevão, 33, who was raised in Waikás and works for Wanasseduume., These mature trees were planted more than a decade ago by Luiz Ye’kwana. He was murdered by garimpeiros after refusing to transport them upriver, villagers say., Violence is a recurrent problem around garimpeiros, as becomes graphically evident the next day. Outside the health post, two garimpeiros are wrapping a dead body in a tarpaulin. The dead man was known as Eduardo at Tatuzão, the illegal gold mining camp two hours’ boat ride upstream. But everybody uses an alias there. The nurse who fought to save his life discovered that his real name was Ralf Cabral and he was 21. The garimpeiros say he shot himself., His eyes are wide open, he is dressed in black football shorts, and there is a bandage over the bullet hole in his chest. “He’s been here for five months, and now he’s done this,” says Manoel dos Santos, 49, wrapping Cabral’s body. “I have no idea why.”, The health post was built by the Brazilian government to serve the village’s 150 Ye’kwana people, but also handles hundreds of garimpeiro cases each year, including miscarriages, malaria, snake bites, broken limbs, knife and gunshot wounds. “It’s a war here,” says Giselle Dornellas, 33, the nurse who kept Cabral alive for 12 hours., Garimpo gold is seductive and buys televisions and phones. Four villagers work as boat pilots, others deliver food, and even the village community centre was built with garimpo money., But the cacao project will offer an alternative, says its coordinator, ISA anthropologist Moreno Saraiva. “We’re trying to build another possible future,” he says. “It will take five years, but if we don’t do this now there will never be another alternative.”, The project was inspired by another ISA project that since 2016 has produced edible mushrooms in other Yanomami villages. On paper the cacao project makes sense. Most of the world’s cacao production is in Africa, but the plant is native to the Amazon and was domesticated in South America 4,000 years ago. The Aztecs used the beans as money. And a Spanish map from 1775 called the Yanomami area the “Pais de los cacaguales” – or “Cacao Land”., “You have a traditional and well-spread presence of native cocoa trees,” says food researcher Roberto Smeraldi, vice-president of the Atá Institute founded by Alex Atala – the Michelin starred Brazilian chef renowned for using ingredients from the Amazon., Smeraldi recruited César de Mendes, a chocolate specialist based near the Amazon city of Belém for the cacao project. ISA and the indigenous associations organised well-attended workshops with de Mendes in Waikás in 2018 and 2019 to show villagers how cacao seeds are processed to make chocolate., Fruit from mature Yanomami cacao trees was used to produce a trial run. A thousand 50g bars of the bitter, delicious Yanomami chocolate quickly sold out at an event in São Paulo last December, despite a £9.20 price tag. Customers were happy to pay to compensate for the destruction caused by garimpo, de Mendes says. Profits went to both indigenous associations., “I am not being much of a businessman, I am being more an activist,” de Mendes says. “We are selling to an aware public.”, He learned his trade from his grandmother, who made her own chocolate in an Amazon riverside community, and singles out the Yanomami chocolate’s notes of almond oil and flowers, light acidity and sweetness. “These give this cacao its own personality,” he says., Smeraldi argues that the Yanomami cacao’s origins in this isolated jungle could make its genetic properties attractive to the world cacao industry, which is vulnerable to climate change and blights such as the witches’ broom fungus which ravaged cacao plantations in the state of Bahia three decades ago., And the chocolate’s strong, persistent taste could find its niche in the booming, specialist chocolate market, he says. Distinct fruits and flavours are increasingly sought out, as happened with wine when customers graduated from ordering “red” or “white” to specific grapes and countries. “It is a product of high complexity,” Smeraldi says., According to a report from Research and Markets, the global premium chocolate market is growing at nearly 10% a year, and demand for organic, dark and “clean label” chocolate is a key market trend. In Ecuador, Kichwa indigenous people have been producing their own organic Kallari chocolate, sold worldwide, since 2007., But Bolsonaro’s government is heading in the opposite direction. It is sending a bill to Congress to legalise garimpo, which the energy minister, Admiral Bento Albuquerque, recently presented to European diplomats., The news chills villagers in Waikás. “If Bolsonaro succeeds, it’s the end for our people,” says Eduardo da Silva, 65. But it has also bolstered support for the cacao project., “We have to do it for our children, not for us,” says Felipe Gimenes, 45, the village schoolteacher and former chief who planted an extra 200 cacao seedlings on his own plot. “This is our opportunity.”, This piece was edited on 28 January 2020 to include a more accurate translation of remarks made by Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featurescacao not gold chocolate trees offer future to amazon tribes aoe", "label": 0}, "train-185": {"text": "\n'Kids are taking the streets': climate activists plan avalanche of events as 2020 election looms\n, Young demonstrators aim to make the climate crisis a central issue of the presidential campaign, \nLee van der Voo in Oregon, \n\nSat 25 Jan 2020 06.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 07.32 EDT\n\n, Organizers in the youth climate movement plan an avalanche of activities beginning next week, determined to make the future of the climate the major issue of the 2020 election., Capitalizing on turnout in the September climate strikes, when 6 million people worldwide turned out to demand urgent action to address the escalating ecological emergency, young US organizers are making the leap from mobilization to demands. They’re planning widespread voter activation in the 2020 US presidential election as well as direct action targeting the fossil fuel industry and the banks and politicians that enable it., “The headline message of the strikes in 2020 is: the kids are taking to the streets to strike for climate and they’re asking you to vote,” said Katie Eder, the executive director of Future Coalition, a communications and training hub for youth climate groups., There are more than 300 organizations involved in the efforts, Eder said, including some of the largest youth and adult coalitions in climate movement: Fridays for Future, the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, Zero Hour, Extinction Rebellion., “We’re starting to have the conversation within the strikes about how we’re balancing both the political targets and the financial targets,” Eder said, calling power and money “really key to the root causes of why we’re not addressing climate change”., Activists have planned widespread voter mobilization campaigns; three days of national strikes, marches, and direct action against politicians and banks beginning on Earth Day (22 April); regular strikes on Fridays and additional strikes targeting primary elections in every state; plus an international day of action, college divestment campaigns, and a huge push by the Sunrise Movement to turn out the vote for Bernie Sanders and a Green New Deal., Stories of climate awakening are a universal truth for young Americans living in the age of worsening climate conditions. Isabella Fallahi, who has asthma, for example, has lived within 14 miles of a coal-burning generating facility all of her life., “A lot of people don’t think of Indiana, or the midwest, for that matter, as frontline communities,” she said. “We face the silent killers. The terrible air quality because of mining projects, the terrible water quality because of mining projects, the health effects associated with both of those, droughts that cripple the agricultural economies that we’re based off of.”, But Fallahi, like many other young organizers, is also galvanized by the tech proficiency of her generation, born into the era of hashtags and the ubiquitous touchscreen. She was a speaker at the UN climate change conference in Madrid (COP 25) in December 2019, when she and other youth were nearly ejected for protesting against the fossil fuel executives on panels and in negotiations., Approximately 200 young people in 40 countries, many of whom were at the conference, organized a response called Polluters Out. In 20 days, they had a website, a multilingual launch video, a press release in seven languages, and a list of demands. In actions set for March, they will call for the exclusion of fossil fuel interests at COP26 and transparency in the UN framework on climate change, as well as inclusion of indigenous and human rights in the Paris agreement. Regional efforts in the US will also call for a Green New Deal, a halt to new fossil fuel infrastructure, divestments from fossil fuels by universities and campaign funds, and the targeting of specific banks for fossil fuel investments., The groups stay in touch through conference calls, Slack, Zoom, and Google Drive. Activists in Cuba – who can’t download the apps because of the US trade embargo – tune in through WhatsApp. There’s a Slack channel for supporting scientists, too. And meetings wait for organizers in the Amazon who need to travel to towns for internet access., For all of them, there is community. People to cry with over the photo of the bay in Australia, so covered in smoke that it is hardly visible., “Overall, I think the way to look at this perspective on the youth movement is: it is cohesive in that they do communicate, but the orgs are not all the same,” said Natalie Mebane, associate director of US Policy for 350.org and an adult mentor for Zero Hour, both organizations intensely focused on voter turnout for climate for 2020. “We want to make sure that climate becomes the number one issue on voters’ minds.”, The Sunrise Movement, like 350.org and Zero Hour, has taken that to a grassroots level. That is how Naina Agrawal-Hardin ended up in the guidance office at Washtenaw high school outside Ann Arbor, Michigan, for an interview. She’s a leader for the Ann Arbor hub of the Sunrise Movement. And she’s 16, a junior. Her school, she said, was supportive., “Whenever I have to take conference calls or interviews during school hours, they usually will write me a pass to get out of class,” she said., Agrawal-Hardin is planning a watch party at her home – a sneak peek at the forthcoming documentary Generation Green New Deal and a video about the Sunrise Movement’s 2020 campaign, as part of its annual kickoff. Sunrise provides the documentaries, discussion questions, and near-daily training on organizing and recruitment techniques.

Now scientists are celebrating the gray wolves’ successful return from the brink of extinction as one of the greatest rewilding stories the world has ever seen., “The pressure was huge with this project,” said Doug Smith, the senior wildlife biologist of the Yellowstone Wolf Project who was hired by the National Park Service (NPS) to head the reintroduction in the 1990s. “If we couldn’t do this here, on our own turf in one of the most famous parks in the world, as one of the richest nations in the world, then who could? This was an example to the globe in restoring nature.”, But because wolves are one of the most controversial animals on the planet, the recovery remains fiercely contested., Wolves once roamed from the Arctic to Mexico, but they were hunted to eradication across the country from the 1870s onward. By 1926, the last wolf pack had been killed in Yellowstone by park employees as part of the policy of the time to eliminate all predators., They were mythologized as a danger to humans, a menace to the ranchers settling the west and competition for big-game hunters. That mythology still persists to this day, although wolves very rarely attack people, especially compared with cougars and bears. Wolves kill 0.2% to 0.3% of available livestock., When the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted in the 70s, wolves were among the original species on the list. The ESA, a landmark piece of legislation to save declining species from extinction, compels the US Fish and Wildlife Service to protect endangered or threatened species and develop a plan for their recovery. But because wolves are so polarizing, the reintroduction did not take place until more than 20 years later., The need for restoration was glaring. In the 70 years of the wolves’ absence, the entire Yellowstone ecosystem had fallen out of balance. Coyotes ran rampant, and the elk population exploded, overgrazing willows and aspens. Without those trees, songbirds began to decline, beavers could no longer build their dams and riverbanks started to erode. Without beaver dams and the shade from trees and other plants, water temperatures were too high for cold-water fish., In 1995, in collaboration with Canadian agencies, 14 wolves were captured in Jasper national park and brought to Yellowstone. Smith recalls that as they transported the wolves through the park in horse trailers, people lined the roads to be part of the historic event. “Every time we stopped, visitors would come up and ask if they could pose next to the trailer. You couldn’t even see the wolves in there, but people wanted photos. That’s the presence and magic that wolves have, and that’s the first time we all felt that.”, In Yellowstone, the wolves were kept in acclimation pens for several weeks to keep their homing instincts from leading them back to Canada. Shortly after the pens were opened, though, wolf No 10 headed north and crossed the border into Montana, followed by No 9, his mate, pregnant with pups. He was illegally shot by a rancher, but she and her eight pups were rescued and moved back to the safety of park boundaries. Their bloodline can be traced to most of the wolves in the park to this day., Scientists always knew that as the top predator, wolves were the missing piece in this ecosystem. But they were astonished at how quickly their return stimulated a transformation. The elk and deer populations started responding immediately. Within about 10 years, willows rebounded. In 20, the aspen began flourishing. Riverbanks stabilized. Songbirds returned as did beavers, eagles, foxes and badgers. “And those are just the things we have the time and funding to study,” said Smith. “There are probably myriad other effects just waiting to be discovered.”, While the restoration of wolves in Yellowstone has cost about $30m, wolf ecotourism brings in $35m  annually, in an economic boom for the surrounding communities. Yellowstone is unique in the world as the best place to observe wild wolves, which are generally shy, reclusive and favor remote areas. This is as true for scientists as it is tourists, and as a result, wolf research in the park is considered far more advanced than anywhere else., Wolves have repopulated parts of their historic range as far south as Colorado, where evidence of a pack was just discovered earlier this month, as far west as Mount Lassen in northern California, and to the doorsteps of the Cascades in eastern Oregon and Washington., “It truly is going to go down in my career as one of those defining moments I was proud of to be part of from the beginning, that’s shaping the politics of conservation,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, which organized political support and legal actions for reintroduction and remains committed to restoring wolves to their historic ranges., “At the same time, it’s not finished. We have not restored wolves to where they can and should be where it’s ecologically correct. We still have a lot of conflict, and concerns.” If state plans weren’t so “over-controlling, wolves would be running over the spine of the Rockies into the south-west today”., When wolves were deemed recovered enough to be removed from the endangered species list, management of populations was left to each state. In Wyoming, people are allowed to shoot wolves on sight outside the borders of national parks. In Montana, it is permissible with a hunting permit., Regardless of the challenges ahead, the thriving wolves in Yellowstone illustrate the success of the Endangered Species Act as a framework to conserve biodiversity, and a hopeful example at a time when the UN has revealed that the planet is on the brink of the sixth mass extinction., “Absent the ESA, I am certain that wolves would never have come back,” said Clark. “Nearly 2,000 species would likely be extinct if they didn’t have the backstop of the ESA, which is this country’s commitment to the conservation and restoration of biodiversity within our borders.” , “It’s our conscience, our reminder that we’re responsible for maintaining a healthy planet now and in the future.”yellowstone wolf project 25th anniversary", "label": 0}, "train-187": {"text": "\nAerial footage reveals feral horse crisis in burnt-out Kosciuszko national park – video\n, New aerial footage from Kosciuszko national park reveals horrific fire damage to the landscape.

Nearly 30 years on, is Middletown still at risk?, Geoff Manaugh, \n\nSat 1 Feb 2020 06.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2020 13.26 EST\n\n, In the summer of 1991, Middletown high school, roughly 70 miles north of Manhattan in New York’s verdant Orange County, acquired a handful of video cameras. The goal was to train the school’s teenage students in film-making and media production, using local subjects as a starting point – perhaps a documentary about the city’s sports teams or an amateur talkshow. Instead, under the tutelage of Middletown high’s popular English teacher, Fred Isseks, a rowdy and diverse group of teenagers organised themselves into an investigative journalism unit., Officially, Isseks’ class was open only to the school’s oldest students, aged 16 to 18 – but, unofficially, it welcomed everyone. Kids not even enrolled in the course joined Isseks’ students in shooting short films. The teenagers alternated between grungy early-90s flannel and choker necklaces and awkward attempts at business attire as they honed their reporting skills. They invited local representatives into the school’s new media studio for a political debate, and covered topics such as the city’s curfew for teens. One former student joked to me that the class became a surreal mix of “rap videos and corrupt politicians”., Over the next six years, culminating in 1997, students passing through Isseks’ high school class would film, edit, and release a feature-length documentary that exposed a generation’s worth of illegal, mob-connected dumping of toxic materials in their part of New York state. Industrial solvents, liquid refrigerants, crushed battery casings, petroleum additives, printing inks and untreated medical waste, including radioactive isotopes: it all flooded the landfills around Middletown, constructed without ground liners, atop freshwater aquifers that fed the region’s drinking wells. As a retired compactor operator explains to Isseks’ students in the film, sometimes there was so much bloody hospital waste on the ground, it looked as if he had run someone over. Another interviewee, a former driver for a mafia-owned waste-hauling firm, described tipping fuming truckloads of paint sludge from a nearby automobile factory straight into the dump. Middletown residents were told it was all just certified municipal waste., I thought it was too fantastical to be true – that all these politicians I saw on TV were actually covering something up, Isseks’ course, known as Electronic English, would propel many of its students into careers in media production and environmental law, but at the time their work did not receive universal approval. There were warnings of arrest from the county sheriff; near-total disinterest from the city’s local newspaper; public frustration from regional politicians; and at least one death threat., David Birmingham, now 42, is a former student of Isseks’ who graduated from Middletown high in 1995. He lives in town with his wife and four children; their eldest daughter graduated from the school in 2019. “In the beginning, I just thought it was too fantastical to be true,” Birmingham says. “To me, it was like: there’s no way there’s a toxic waste dump basically in my backyard. There’s no way all these politicians I see on TV are actually covering something up. It seemed like a movie – like this couldn’t happen here. People would tell me, ‘You know, this isn’t what you think it is.’ But, as it turned out, it was exactly what we thought it was.”, While Isseks’ class suggests an early affinity with today’s youth climate activists, it also relied upon slightly different tactics, based not in protest or spectacle, but documentation. As Birmingham describes it to me, it was about showing up, over and over again, at local meetings, relentlessly filing freedom of information requests, and, importantly, getting things on film. Nevertheless, the question seems to haunt both Isseks and Birmingham: what did the documentary achieve? Is Middletown, as a community, safer today because of the students’ work?, ***, Middletown sits amid rich, rolling agricultural lands and mountains with biblical names, such as Mount Adam and Mount Eve. The financial magazine Kiplinger routinely rates it as an idyllic place to raise a family, and an equally inviting place to retire. Humans have long been seduced by the region: 12,500-year-old indigenous archaeological sites have been discovered here, some of the oldest known in North America., Just outside the city are synthetic landforms that swelled into being in the 1960s. These unearthly blisters, together occupying an area more than three times the size of Disneyland, California, loom over the surrounding fields and forests. They are the county’s landfills, built to contain only municipal household waste. However, as the students’ documentary discovered, and sworn legal testimony taken in the 1990s made explicit, this was by no means the case. The landfills accepted anything and everything, from customers hundreds of miles away in Pennsylvania and Ohio, sometimes in the middle of the night, when the landfill gates were left unlocked. Although some of the dumps investigated by the students were as far as 15 miles outside Middletown – on land within the boundaries of neighbouring municipalities –others were right down the hill, along the banks of the Wallkill River. It was the residents of Middletown, a city of more than 25,000, who found themselves directly in the centre of them all., Isseks, 71, still lives in Middletown with his wife, Denise. Their daughter graduated from Middletown high in 2010; Isseks retired from teaching the following year. Isseks is himself a 1966 graduate of the school; his senior yearbook describes him as “intelligent and sincere, with a streak of devil in him”. While teaching at Middletown in 2003, Isseks earned a PhD in communications from the European graduate school in Switzerland, whose celebrity faculty has included Slavoj Zizek and Judith Butler. Isseks’s thesis, Media Courage, includes a chapter on the philosophical potential of the American high school system. His belief that teenagers need to be given work with genuine meaning and consequence in the world would shape his entire teaching career and, in the process, change his students’ lives., Reflecting on the project today, Isseks places the county’s three major landfills – the Town of Wallkill, Orange County, and Al Turi landfills – in the context of geology, not cultural theory. During the last ice age, he explains, massive glaciers sculpted the land into the gentle bowls and valleys that would later be so appealing to Middletown’s 20th-century landfill entrepreneurs. Landscape, for Isseks, is drama solidified. When we meet, he is wearing a T-shirt with the geological ages of the Earth depicted in a colourful graphic on its front. (Later, after a boozy dinner, Isseks is able to recite the eras of the Earth backwards, from memory, making only one minor error.), The students’ documentary originated from a passing comment. In 1991, Isseks tells me, he heard from an environmentalist friend that former employees at the Town of Wallkill dump had unsettling stories to tell – and that a few were willing to speak on the record. Isseks asked his students if they might be interested in interviewing the men. To his delight, several said yes., The resulting hour-long film, titled Garbage, Gangsters And Greed, opens with an interview with former bulldozer operator Donald “Dutch” Smith. At the time, Smith lived in a trailer just outside the Wallkill landfill gates. “I tell you,” he says, speaking to the camera as birdsong trills in the background, “there’s thousands and thousands of tonnes of toxic waste in there, of anything you can name, from radioactive to hospital waste”. Smith’s words are followed by shots of rust-coloured leachate pooling on the soil: unidentified chemicals oozing from the waste mass. “You name it, it’s in that landfill – and I know it’s in there, because I buried lots of it.” The town’s supervisor at the time, Howard Mills, described by the local newspaper as a “Republican icon”, admits later in the film that this was not an exaggeration. “It’s absolutely correct that there is a tremendous amount of toxic waste remaining in that landfill… We make no attempt to deny that,” Mills says, flanked by county officials. “This is a dangerous landfill.”, The documentary is a mix of handheld footage, produced during various acts of trespass at the county’s landfills, and formal, on-camera interviews with politicians and retired landfill workers, often staged in the high school’s recording studio. One of the students’ most shocking discoveries comes during an interview with Dieter Bohnwagner, a stocky, mullet-haired former worker at the Orange County landfill. In the film, Bohnwagner admits there is a “hidden landfill” on Orange County land, somewhere in the woods beyond the sixth fairway of a local publicly owned golf course. Trespassing across the course – and filming themselves every step of the way, as golfers play in the background – the students locate this illegal dump, finding a dozen crushed, 55-gallon chemical drums half-buried in the earth., Isseks shows me a letter he received from Orange County representatives after he informed them of his students’ discovery: rather than offer thanks for locating a site of potential risk to the Middletown community, it threatened Isseks and his students with arrest should they ever attempt to return. (One of Isseks’ former students suggests to me that perhaps this response was not unfair: Isseks, at the very least, was not discouraging minors under his supervision from trespassing and publicly antagonising figures allegedly connected to the New York mafia.) For his part, Isseks insists that he went out of his way to ensure his students’ safety, often bringing other adults along on excursions. He also made sure the students’ parents knew exactly what the class was up to and when, becoming long-term friends with many in the process., In one interview that did not make it into the film, Isseks tells me, Bohnwagner also claimed that a fairway at the same golf course had been built over a dumping ground for household appliances. Hundreds of refrigerators, leaking toxic CFCs, allegedly lie underground there. Facing what he interpreted as professional retaliation for complaining about conditions at the landfill, Bohnwagner also threatened to reveal the location of something called “the tomb”. The tomb, he claimed, was an unlined pit into which chemical waste had been dumped, inside a local, publicly owned park. Whether or not Bohnwagner’s tomb, or those hundreds of discarded refrigerators, even exist is unclear; when I ask the parks commissioner for Orange County about these allegations, he responds that this is the first time he has ever heard such rumours., Perhaps the group’s most significant feat of reporting came in June 1996, when a Middletown sheriff’s lieutenant escorted Isseks and two female students into the county’s sheriff station. They were attempting to discover the truth about a logbook from the Wallkill landfill. In the late 1980s, a burglar had broken in late at night, it was claimed, and, improbably, stolen this notebook: the only record of what had been dumped and buried there – and by whom. According to Isseks, he and his teenage students had made multiple, formal requests for information about the book for two years; the sheriff’s office consistently replied that no such notebook existed., The lieutenant led the group into the station’s storage facility. He opened a document box, reached inside, and said, “This is what you’re looking for, right?” Out came the missing logbook. He encouraged the students to take it home – and to copy it., The book contained meticulous handwritten notes by Orange County sheriffs’ deputies, stationed at the nearby Town of Wallkill dump. Over hundreds of entries, they had documented the illegal burial of toxic waste in a landfill meant only to receive municipal rubbish. What’s more, the log confirmed that much of this dumping had been done by haulage firms connected to the East Coast mob, including one owned by the Mongelli organised crime family. (Louis Mongelli Sr, former owner of Orange County Sanitation, had allegedly disappeared into the federal witness protection program in 1994.) The deputies had also noted every single ticket they’d written to drivers hauling prohibited loads – though, to the deputies’ frustration, most of these tickets simply disappeared, unpaid, never to be submitted to local courts., For Isseks and his students, the logbook was undeniable proof of illegality – not just evidence of toxic dumping, but of collusion between town officials and corrupt waste-hauling firms. More importantly, Isseks tells me, the book’s mysterious reappearance in the sheriff’s archive was a sign that the students’ efforts were succeeding. Even the deputies now seemed to be on their side, accelerating a sense that the city wanted its toxic secrets unearthed., ***, By the mid-90s, the students’ documentary had picked up political steam. Birmingham tells me that he grew accustomed to seeing local politicians annoyed at the students, irritated by Birmingham’s own habit of showing up to film town hall meetings, filing endless freedom of information requests. One evening in spring 1994, though, a politician pulled Birmingham aside and asked for an update. What was going on at the landfills? What had the students found out? An unruly group of trespassing teenagers had quietly become the best news source in town., Their most powerful ally would prove to be New York state representative Maurice Hinchey. As Hinchey and others had shown, mob connections to illegal dumping were by no means limited to the landfills around Middletown. In Poisoning For Profit: The Mafia And Toxic Waste In America, published in 1985, authors Alan A Block and Frank R Scarpitti documented similar scenarios across the US. Some haulage firms, they wrote, deliberately stockpiled trucks filled with liquid toxins, waiting for rainy days; their drivers would then circle around on local freeways with their valves open, draining hazardous chemicals directly on to the roadbed. One driver boasted that “the only way I can get caught is if the windshield wipers or the tires of the car behind me start melting”., Other mob-owned companies would mix liquid waste with home heating oil, meaning that unwitting customers could stay warm in the winter, while burning toxic waste at the same time. Some businesses would “cocktail” their wastes with construction debris, allowing crushed drywall, lumber and other porous building materials to absorb dangerous chemicals. (In 1995, the Town of Wallkill landfill was capped using just such construction debris.), These mafia associations began to worry some of Isseks’ students. One member of the class, speaking to me on condition of anonymity, describes receiving a death threat. The student was pulled aside at a late-night “field party” – an outdoor get-together – by the adult son of a local politician. Drunk, the man warned Isseks’ student to “leave the landfill alone”. The man went on to falsely claim that he was suffering from terminal cancer, adding that he “wasn’t afraid to take someone with him”. Sufficiently spooked, the student dropped Isseks’ class. Another student vividly recalls being followed home after an afternoon filming at the dump, by a car they had seen parked outside the landfill gates. These experiences contributed to a sense among the students that they might be getting in over their heads., For Hinchey, who died in November 2017, the Middletown high school students’ dedication was a shot in the arm; in the documentary, he seems energised. He even launched a new round of public hearings in the town of Wallkill, questioning former landfill employees, among other witnesses, about what had really been buried near Middletown – testimonies that further fuelled the students’ reporting., The students were invited to meet President Bill Clinton. They handed him a VHS tape with a cut of their documentary, It was in 1993, however, that the class had perhaps its ultimate brush with power. The students were invited to attend an event at Stewart Air National Guard Base where they would meet President Bill Clinton. Birmingham took advantage of the opportunity to hand the president a VHS tape with an early cut of their documentary. Despite Clinton’s thumbs-up, the narrator of this scene drily remarks that the students received no official response. Four years later, in 1997, when the final cut of their documentary was released, the question of the landfills’ long-term effects – and the Middletown community’s safety – remained unanswered., Hoping to better understand the students’ legacy, I visited New York state wildlife pathologist Ward Stone at an assisted-living facility in upstate New York, where he has retired. Stone, who participated in the documentary, is a broad-shouldered former football player unafraid of corporate power. Knocked down by a series of strokes, he remains, in his words, “a fighter”. In the film, we see Stone standing in the road, hands on his hips, loudly arguing with a landfill official; his attempts to run chemical tests had been consistently thwarted, his samples physically confiscated by police., “Pursue the chemicals,” Stone urges me, insisting that the story of these landfills is far from over, their legacy now hidden in the bodies of local animals, from birds to fish. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), Stone’s former employer, confims that since Stone’s time the DEC “has not conducted any investigations of contaminant levels in wildlife associated with closed landfills in the Wallkill River watershed”., ***, Isseks is still in close contact with many of the students who passed through his classroom. Even those he has not kept in touch with remember him fondly: when we go out for dinner at a local pizza restaurant, a man sitting several tables away recognises him, offers an effusive hello, and explains that he took Isseks’ English class in the late 80s., Rachel Raimist was one of the first students to get involved in the landfill documentary. At the time, Raimist tells me, she was just another bored teenager, with dyed hair, a pair of battered Doc Martens, and an interest in photography. One day, she and a friend decided to skip class and go to Burger King. On their way across the parking lot, they ran into Isseks. His response was disappointed, rather than disciplinary, and she credits his intervention with changing her life. “You shouldn’t be cutting class,” she remembers Isseks saying, “you should be taking Electronic English.” Curious, Raimist signed up, and within days was helping to uncover her town’s buried secrets. “I loved the power of telling stories and getting adults upset,” she says with a laugh. Raimist now works in television, and even has a media lab named after her at the University of Minnesota, the Rachel Raimist Feminist Media Center. “I would not be directing television now if it wasn’t for Fred,” she says. “Fred had a huge influence on who I am, and how I see the world.”, Another former student, Jeff Dutemple (class of 1994), works as a camera operator on shows including Apple TV’s Dickinson. “I think there are more people I worked with on those documentaries in high school who still work in film and television than the people I went to film school with,” he says. Jon Gunther, who graduated in 2000, and took Isseks’ course early in his high school years, now practises environmental law., Although all three major landfills explored in the documentary are now closed and no longer receive waste of any kind, concern about their impact on the region persists. Today, Isseks has new allies. Susan Cleaver is a photographer and environmental activist based in Goshen, 10 miles from Middletown. Concerned that the DEC has not done enough to monitor for pollutants, and alarmed by rumours of local health issues potentially connected to the landfills, Cleaver has funded a series of water-quality tests along the Wallkill River. She shows me three-ring binders stuffed with test results and photographs, including long lists of chemical elements and their concentrations in the water. High levels of ammonia, arsenic and magnesium, among dozens of chemicals, have been detected., One of the worst of these is toluene, a petrol additive and potent nerve toxin, according to former Orange County legislator Tom Pahucki. Pahucki served in local government from 1994-2013, and still lives in the area, where he now works as a real estate broker. When he stood for the first time, Pahucki says, it was a “single-issue election”: you either agreed with his opponent, who sought to reopen and even expand the county’s landfills, or you wanted to close those facilities entirely. Although the landfills had been a dependable source of local employment, Pahucki won, signalling a clear shift in opinion, fuelled in no small part by Isseks’ students, who had been broadcasting their in-progress documentary on a local television channel., Just a few months after being elected, in 1994, Pahucki was alerted to something strange happening along the edge of the landfill, on the banks of the Wallkill River. The trees were falling over – in the wrong direction. Rather than leaning toward the water, as the ground around them eroded, they were instead falling back toward the landfill, evidence that their roots were being pushed out from beneath. The landfill was slumping. Alarmed, Pahucki pointed this out to Orange County engineers. When he came back a few weeks later to see if anything had changed, someone had simply cut down the trees. “That’s how we do things,” Pahucki says, disappointed. “You got a problem with the trees? Well, we’ll just cut them down.”, ***, In October 2019, Isseks, Cleaver, Birmingham and I go for a long hike along the Wallkill River, scrambling through thick growth across from the Orange County landfill. At one point, a DEC employee arrives and begins taking photographs of us from the opposite river bank., Throughout the afternoon, Birmingham seems nostalgic. Now a family man, running his own tutoring business, Birmingham tells me that Isseks’ class awakened in him a passion for environmental conservation. “I remember coming home just generally muddy and dirty, and sometimes smelling a little like a dump,” Birmingham says. For him and his fellow students, the mud, ticks and ruined shoes were a source of pride, an essential part of fact-checking what the adults in town had been telling them. “Still, after all these years,” Birmingham says, referring specifically to the Wallkill landfill, “it boggles my mind what they were going to do with that place. They were literally going to plant grass on top of a known toxic waste dump and build a park and an adjacent school.” That this never came to pass is at least one strike in the documentary’s favour., We’re forgetting where the poison is located. We’ve got to provide maps, so that people know where not to build houses, Although there are no leachate streams visible on our hike, Cleaver notes that previously prominent mounds of rip-rap – dry stone rubble that had been dropped along the edge of the landfill to prevent it from slumping – have disappeared below the waterline. She and Isseks both interpret this as a sign of potential structural failure., For Isseks, the nightmare scenario is that a hurricane or tropical storm – such as Sandy, which dramatically flooded New York City in 2012 – could hit the region, saturating the landfills from below and leading to their collapse. One or both of the Orange County and Al Turi landfills could then slide into and block the Wallkill River. Contaminated waters would back up, flooding tens of thousands of acres of productive farmland with toxins. (Asked about this scenario, Robert Gray, deputy commissioner of the Orange County Department of Public Works, disputes that it is a risk or even a physical possibility, noting that the landfill is capped with a waterproof membrane and sloped to prevent precisely such a collapse.), Just one week after our visit, however, the US General Accounting Office releases a report echoing Isseks’ warning. Climate crisis-enhanced storms of the near-future pose a very real risk of catastrophic flooding at sites of toxic waste storage, the paper concludes, including several sites in New York State, along the Hudson River. The report also clearly states that it only addresses sites recognised by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA “does not have quality information on the boundaries of non-federal” waste-disposal sites, such as those near Middletown; it does not know how many such sites there are, or whether they will be impacted by extreme weather events. They exist in a kind of environmental blind spot., “As I’ve started digitising some of this stuff,” Isseks says, referring to his voluminous personal archives, including hundreds of pages of documents formally requested from Middletown administrators, “there’s a sense that we’re forgetting where the landfills are. We’re forgetting where the poison is located. If nothing else, we’ve got to provide maps for the future, so that people know where not to build their houses or to dig their wells. This stuff is not going away. The problem will be relevant as long as it’s here.”, Meanwhile, Middletown high school is rebuilding its media lab, although it is not clear what the focus of the students’ work will be, or if they are even aware of their school’s investigative pedigree. Isseks tells me that among city officials his students’ watchdog role has been missed. With a mischievous grin, he relays a final anecdote. More than a year after the documentary was finished, Middletown politicians found themselves confronting yet another controversial project, this time a waste-to-ethanol plant. Orange County legislator Roberta Murphy wrote an exasperated letter to the local newspaper asking: where are those Middletown students, now that we really need them?, • If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)., • This article was amended on 5 February 2020.

By 2016, there were more than 50 recorded entanglements that left whales injured or killed. Whales got ropes tangled around their mouths, making it difficult for them to eat. Crab lines cut through tissue and caused infections., Although whales and fishing had coexisted for decades, this was a new problem. So what was driving it?, A new study published in the journal Nature Communications points at climate breakdown as a factor in the mass entanglements., When the situation was unfolding in 2015 and 2016, it surprised most people, but not Jarrod Santora, an ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the lead author of the paper., Santora was studying the ecosystem effects of the marine heat wave, known as “the blob”, that was happening off the coast of California at the time. Heat waves alter the ocean’s upwelling – the process in which deep, cold, nutrient-rich water rises to the surface. The upwelling in 2015 and 2016 shrunk to just a narrow band along the coast, causing organisms to cluster there. Due to a heatwave-related decline in krill, whales switched to feeding on anchovies in shallower and shallower waters. In addition, the crab fishing season – an $88m industry on the US west coast – had been delayed from November to April, and came to coincide with the whales’ presence., “It’s like when only one restaurant is open in a town, and everyone ends up piling in around that restaurant,” Santora explains. “And that can cause conflict. There were thousands of whales and thousands of crab pots going out, so was a perfect set of events to cause entanglements.”, In September 2015, conservationists, wildlife managers and fishermen came together to form a working group to address the issue. Santora joined the group at a time when emotions were running high on both sides of the issue. “It was a great opportunity to bring in a scientific view of long cycles in the ocean,” he said. He began to work as an embedded scientific advisor, spending three years studying and listening to the concerns of the group’s members., Entanglements are down now, and the scientists are helping to build a data-driven website that can predict when and where the whales are likely to be feeding off the west coast. At the same time, crab fishermen are experimenting with new ways to log their movements using solar-powered vessel tracking information systems that record boat positions every few seconds. And there’s the development of ropeless crab traps, which can be dropped and come up on their own. These technologies cost two to six times more than traditional crabbing gear, making them a hard sell in an industry with already razor-thin margins., Crab lines are far from the only challenges humpback whales face in coastal waters. It’s clear that climate breakdown driven by human activity is causing our oceans to get warmer – marine heat waves have doubled in frequency since 1982, Santora says. “Increasing climate variability means increased uncertainty. This is the new normal: not having any vision of what is ahead. And that’s really scary.”, But for now, the whale populations off the west coast are thriving. “We got here because of successful management and acts put in place in the 1960s and 1970s like the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act,” says Santora. “The grey whales are the highest they’ve ever been, and humpback whales have remarkably rebounded.” Seals and sea lions are also close to their maximum numbers, and all those bodies need to eat., Armed with better data, Santora is optimistic the problem of whale entanglements can be solved – and that managers can be more proactive in anticipating potential issues that pop up between humans and marine creatures., why were whales increasingly caught in crab lines a scientist found its climate crisis", "label": 0}, "train-190": {"text": "Dam fine: estate owners across UK queue up to reintroduce beavers, Beavers can regenerate landscapes, encourage wildlife and prevent flooding – and they have friends in high places, The must-have accessory for every English country estate was once a gothic folly, a ha-ha or a croquet lawn. Now it is a pair of beavers., Landowners and large estates are racing to acquire licences to reintroduce the water-loving rodents, which were hunted to extinction in Britain 400 years ago., Natural England has issued 13 beaver licences since 2017, and beavers are breeding and roaming as wild as they can in large fenced “trial” enclosures in North Yorkshire, Cornwall, Essex, Devon, Somerset and Gloucestershire. This year, beaver pairs will be returned to Cumbria, Norfolk, West Sussex and Dorset., This week, a pair of beavers were released onto pools above an old watermill on the 12,500 acre Holnicote estate on Exmoor, the first National Trust property to take them. Approval has just been granted for beavers to be added to the Knepp estate in West Sussex, the former dairy farm that has been rewilded by Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree., But beaver-loving landowners face delays with a waiting list to acquire the herbivorous animals, which are now sourced from the wild population in Scotland, where the beaver was officially recognised as a native species once again in 2016., “We are worried about how we will get hold of them because there are so many people who want them, which is incredible,” said Isabella Tree, whose book, Wilding, has driven a surge in interest in rewilding., A YouGov poll this week found overwhelming public support for reintroducing beavers into Britain, with 76% of people supporting the idea, by far the most popular mammal for reintroductions ahead of the wild cat, wolf and lynx., One ecologist described showing a group of wealthy landowners around one new beaver project. He said: “They were a shooting and fishing fraternity, made their money out of banking. By the end of the day, they all wanted beavers.”, The beaver has yet to be officially recognised – and given legal protection – as a native species in England, but new research revealing the beneficial impact of their dam-building is currently being considered by the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra)., While licenses only permit beavers to be placed in large “trial” enclosures, escapees from privately owned collections have created a burgeoning population of truly wild beavers on the River Otter in east Devon., The Guardian has learned that there are other secretive populations of free-living beavers on rivers in Kent, north Somerset, Gloucestershire, west Devon and Wales., Beaver ecologist Derek Gow, who has overseen many of the licensed reintroductions, said escapes occurred because beavers’ strong teeth were like bolt-cutters., Hailing beavers as “ecosystem engineers”, Gow said: “They turn landscapes that are largely dead into environments that wildlife can recolonise.”, The five-year government study of both fenced and wild beavers will show how their dams can prevent flooding by drastically slowing the flow of streams, purify water polluted by nitrates and phosphates, store carbon and create an explosion in other wildlife., “All of these benefits could accrue in every single headwater stream or catchment in England,” said Prof Richard Brazier of the University of Exeter, who led the study. Brazier’s modelling – currently being examined by Defra – identifies suitable habitat where beavers could improve river catchments in virtually every part of England, Scotland and Wales., During five years monitoring a two-hectare study enclosure in west Devon, Brazier and colleagues found that frogspawn increased from 10 clumps to 650 clumps last summer, with amphibian life attracting predators such as herons and egrets. Dragonflies, butterflies, aquatic plants, flowers and trees have benefited from new pools created by the beavers. “Bringing that type of biodiversity back is something that you couldn’t engineer,” said Brazier., In Cornwall, Somerset and the Forest of Dean, new beaver enclosures are expected to reduce flash-flooding in villages downstream., The beaver has friends in high places: both the environment minister Zac Goldsmith and former environment secretary Michael Gove have become beaver converts, and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spoken in favour of the animals., Some landowners are won over by potential economic benefits such as ecotourism. Beavers can be secretive and nocturnal but they are also placid, slow-moving animals, which can be watched swimming with their kits in summertime., But not everyone loves the beaver. While beavers will not dam large rivers because the waters are already deep enough for them to feel secure, their dam-building can cause flooding on flood-plains in lowland areas. In Scotland, farmers have shot beavers blamed for flooding farmland., The government is expected to announce later this year that the free-living River Otter beavers will be allowed to stay permanently, paving the way for official, licensed releases of free-living beavers beyond enclosures., Gow said: “We need to move beyond just keeping them in pens. In Britain, species recovery has always been about wee spiders or dormice – things that don’t change landscapes. We have to learn to tolerate animals that change things for the better.”, A Defra spokesperson said: “We are committed to reintroducing formerly native species, such as beavers, where there are clear environmental and socio-economic benefits., “Beavers have a special place in English heritage and can play a role in creating new havens for wildlife and boosting our natural biodiversity. We welcome applications for trial reintroductions of beavers, where these benefits are clear.”beavers uk estate owners reintroduction conservation flooding", "label": 0}, "train-191": {"text": "\nHelp bees by not mowing dandelions, gardeners told\n, Plants provide key food source for pollinators as they come out of hibernation, \nPhoebe Weston, \n\nSat 1 Feb 2020 04.00 EST\n\n, Gardeners should avoid mowing over dandelions on their lawn if they want to help bees, according to the new president of the British Ecological Society., Dandelions – which will start flowering in the UK this month – provide a valuable food source for early pollinators coming out of hibernation, including solitary bees, honey bees and hoverflies., Each dandelion head contains up to 100 individual flowers, known as florets, which contain nectar and pollen. There are 240 species of dandelion in the UK. , Prof Jane Memmott said: “If dandelions were rare, people would be fighting over them. Because they’re common, people pull them out and spray them off and all sorts of horrible things. Just let them flower.”, Memmott, who took over as president of the BES at the start of this year, is also a professor of ecology at the University of Bristol., She said gardeners should avoid planting too many “pompom shaped” flowers, such as old English roses and dahlia, because they focus so much of their energy on producing petals and have very little nectar and pollen. “As a rule, if you can see the pollen and nectar parts of a flower without pulling back petals, then it’s OK for pollinators,” she said., Carrots that have flowered, or “bolted”, and onions in unkempt vegetable gardens are also some of the best plants for pollinators., “People are a lot tidier than they used to be. This whole business of keeping your lawn clipped and pulling the weeds out is part of some British obsession with tidiness,” Memmott said. “If you look back at old pictures, people weren’t as tidy. I think bohemian untidiness is what we’re aiming for – you don’t want it to look like neglect.”, Leaving the grass to grow 8-10cm (3-4in) tall means clovers, daisies, self-heal and creeping buttercup can also flower. “You can’t personally help tigers, whales and elephants but you really can do something for the insects, birds and plants that are local to you,” said Memmott, who encouraged gardeners to halve the amount of mowing they do., The global mass of insects is falling by 2.5% a year and many could be extinct within a century, according to a global scientific review last year., The charity Buglife encourages people to leave a strip of garden that is cut only once in autumn and once in spring. “An awful lot of lawns, especially in older houses, will be built on old meadows so wildflowers come up quite quickly. In a new house they might take a bit longer as they could have had a turf put down,” said Paul Hetherington, the director of communications at Buglife.help bees not mowing dandelions gardeners told aoe", "label": 0}, "train-192": {"text": "\nCountry diary: the telltale signs of a wood mouse\n, Upton-by-Chester, Cheshire: In spring, females establish individual nests beneath hedgerows or tucked into tree roots, but they are drawn to anywhere warm with plentiful food nearby, turning up in bird boxes, sheds and even car radiators, \nElla Davies, \n\nSat 1 Feb 2020 00.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2020 03.40 EST\n\n, In my wildly untidy back garden, the puppy is now big enough to scramble up a rubble pile to get next door. I’m dismantling the heavy chunks of concrete when something much more delicate is revealed: in one particular nook there is a nest. It is no more than a hand’s width in diameter and on a chilly day it looks quite inviting for a small creature: leaves, moss and grass. Access is limited and would require crawling up tight spaces from underneath; coupled with the dark droppings, like tiny grains of black rice, this suggests a rodent resident. It doesn’t smell like a house mouse nest – that pungent aroma of pee – so I suspect this was the summer home of a female wood mouse, perhaps abandoned in favour of community living for the colder months., Wood mice nest together to get through the winter, most often in underground burrows alongside food stores collected in their frantic autumn foraging sprees. In spring, females establish individual nests beneath hedgerows or tucked into tree roots, but they are drawn to anywhere warm with plentiful food nearby, turning up in bird boxes, sheds and even car radiators. Perhaps “garden mouse” should be added to Apodemus sylvaticus’s aliases “wood mouse” and “long-tailed field mouse”., With the architect absent, I have to consider other clues to confirm whose grand design I have discovered. In the autumn, I saw something scurrying in the twilight tangle of brambles where our birdfeeders sit: a small, dark shape attracted by the banquet of fruit and spillages from the messy eaters above. Most of our suburban neighbourhood is laid to lawn and decking, but our patch has several mature trees: elder, cherry, and a big ash that dominates the back corner. Saplings sprout up all over – could they be from forgotten stores of a mouse that favours seeds and fruit pips?, When spring arrives, the puppy is likely to be the first to know if the mouse resurfaces to nest again. I’m hoping our green space can be shared harmoniously, so I’ll be selflessly cuddling the dog on the sofa at night when the mouse is most active.country diary the telltale signs of a wood mouse", "label": 0}, "train-193": {"text": "\nWhy sushi could be the solution to a sea urchin invasion\n, The ravenous creatures are destroying vast swaths of kelp forests, which are crucial for carbon storage. Is the answer staring us in the plate?, \nPatrick Greenfield, \n\nSun 2 Feb 2020 16.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2020 19.50 EST\n\n, Eating as much sushi as humanly possible seems an unlikely way to help save the planet. But one company is hoping fine diners from London to LA to Tokyo will devour enough uni sushi – sea urchin roe – to help restore the planet’s kelp forests., From the North Sea to Tasmania, large parts of these underwater carbon stores – crucial for biodiversity – have vanished, leaving vast “urchin barrens” on the sea floor in their place. In Norway, the expanses of bizarre, prickly orbs are green. In California, they are purple. But wherever the urchins linger, the problems are the same., Once the voracious echinoderms run out of kelp to eat, they do not simply die. Instead, they can stay in stasis for years, billions of them starving in their shells. This makes it impossible for the kelp forests to recover, unless the urchins are removed entirely., Urchinomics has a plan for that. Their idea is to turn the hordes of urchins around the world into a business opportunity by collecting them, feeding them up on sustainably harvested, umami-rich kombu seaweed and selling the lucrative roe to high-end sushi restaurants., “My first ‘a-ha’ moment was a year after the tsunami in eastern Japan,” says Urchinomics CEO Brian Tsuyoshi Takeda, remembering conversations with Japanese fishermen in the aftermath of the 2011 disaster., “When the tsunami hit, it washed away all the predator species that used to be in the water. When the predators disappeared, the urchins exploded in population. The scientists told us it was about seven times the original biomass in a year or two. They literally ate all of the giant kelp forests which were the foundation of the north-east fisheries in Japan.”, According to Takeda, who is based in Norway but has operations in Japan, Canada and the US, Urchinomics has ambitions to make urchin removal and restoration self-sustaining around the world. Demand for uni, the Japanese name for urchins, is rising, and they were named one of the top food trends in 2018., “The more you eat urchins, the better it is for the kelp forests. That’s kind of unique, I think … It has to be about looking towards these win-win situations where you’re creating some sort of economic incentive to help drive the restoration work.”, The company has just announced it has signed a lease to open its first urchin ranch in Norway, where 80 billion of the creatures are estimated to have ravaged kelp forests along the country’s coastline. Takeda hopes the site in Stavanger, the oil capital of Norway, will supply Michelin-starred sushi restaurants in in London, Amsterdam and Brussels this summer., The ability of kelp forests to recover once urchins are removed is impressive, taking mere months. But the problem of urchin barrens is not restricted to Norway., In northern California, the collapse of the once abundant bull kelp forests took just two years. Along large stretches of the 350km coastline from the north of San Francisco to the Oregon border, a combination of intense ocean heating fuelled by the climate crisis and armies of ravenous purple sea urchins laid waste to over 90% of the vast underwater carbon stores between 2014 and 2016., The disintegration of these vital underwater ecosystems caught researchers by surprise, and left a trail of economic destruction. In 2018, a $44m (£33m) recreational red abalone fishery closed after the kelp deforestation triggered mass mortality in the sea snail., “Our kelps are very productive ecosystems but they rely on the cool. We know that they are at risk in a warming ocean in a warming globe,” explains Dr Laura Rogers-Bennett from University of California, Davis, who recently published a study on how a sea-star wasting disease, a marine heatwave and sea urchin boom combined to collapse the bull kelp forests., “Many parts of the world are experiencing kelp forest declines. Frequently they’re being replaced by huge populations of sea urchins,” she continues. “They’ve been seeing this in Japan, Norway; it’s happening in Australia in the southern state of Tasmania.”,  In central California, the destructive armies of purple sea urchins have spread south to Monterey Bay, according to Jan Freiwald, head of the Reef Check Foundation, which has been training recreational divers to perform scientific surveys on ecosystems for over two decades. Yet the presence of sea otters might be helping the resilience of kelp forests., “About half of the sites we monitor have lost the kelp, the other sites are remaining strong. More recently, some have recovered,” he says., “One big difference between Monterey Bay and northern California is that we have sea otters. The sea otters are one of the keystone predators. They can keep the sea urchins in check. And so, actually in the kelp forests around Monterey, we see increases in sea urchins but also see the sea otters beginning to forage more on them. So that might sustain some reefs, rather than the northern coast where we don’t have sea otters.”, Previous research has found that where otters are present, kelp forests tend to store more carbon and are healthier. But simply introducing otters into urchin barrens would not work as the starving shells are of little calorific value to the mammals., Whether or not Urchinomics manages to make it as a viable business, researchers warn that vast stretches of kelp forests along the Pacific coast are disappearing and the urchins must be cleared.

The action produces a “loud high-frequency noise”, sending out “a clear signal” to other males in the area., In the video, the male seal can be seen swimming close to a female, with other males lurking nearby, before it starts clapping., Dr Ben Burville, a researcher at Newcastle University who took the footage, said: “The effect of the clap was instant and the rival males rapidly dispersed., “The clap was incredibly loud and at first I found it hard to believe what I had seen.”, Burville, who had been trying for many years to capture clapping seals on camera, added: “I’ve heard the distinctive shotgun-like cracks many times over the years and I felt sure this clapping behaviour was the source, but filming the seals in action has eluded me for 17 years.”, The video is part of an international study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science., Dr David Hocking, from Monash University in Australia, who led the study, said: “The discovery of ‘clapping seals’ might not seem that surprising, after all, they’re famous for clapping in zoos and aquaria., “But where zoo animals are often trained to clap for our entertainment – these grey seals are doing it in the wild of their own accord.”, The researchers say understanding more about grey seals and other marine life could help protect the species against the harmful effects of pollution., Hocking added: “Clapping appears to be an important social behaviour for grey seals, so anything that disturbed it could impact breeding success and survival for this species”., • This article was amended on 3 February 2020.

His Romney ewes graze among trees and rough ground on a Wiltshire country estate, and it was not obvious at first that some were missing., “Then I sensed that something wasn’t quite right,” said Candy, whose family have farmed in the area for five generations. “I did a rough count and it became clear many of them had gone.”, It turned out that 72 ewes had been taken in the night. Candy was amazed. “At night sheep are glued to the spot they are in,” he said. “They don’t like to move. To get those sheep out of there at night they must have had exceptionally trained dogs and very good stockmanship.”, Candy’s loss is not an isolated one. Figures released this week by the rural insurer NFU Mutual reveal that farm animals worth £3m were stolen from UK farms in 2019., Large-scale sheep thefts in particular are on the rise, making rustling the most costly crime for Britain’s farmers after agricultural vehicle and machinery theft, according to the insurer., Candy’s theft was the third in rapid succession within a few miles. His ewes were taken shortly after Christmas from the Bowood Estate at Derry Hill, near Chippenham. The week before, 61 were stolen from a farm near Melksham, 10 miles away. Forty-five sheep were stolen in November from Lacock, just down the road from Bowood., The loss is hard to take for Candy. He and his wife, Vicky, have worked hard to earn special “high health” accreditation for their flock. It makes replacing the animals they lost harder as they have to source them from farms with the same accreditation or breed from their own animals. It may take two years for the Candys to get them back to where they were at Christmas. “The sheep that have been taken are very difficult to replace,” he said., Local farmers have started up a WhatsApp group to try to keep an eye out for each other. Candy said he did not believe the police took the issue seriously enough. “If tens of thousands of pounds was taken from a bank they’d be all over it,” he said., Hazel Coles could not believe her eyes when more than 50 of her sheep suddenly vanished from the fields of her Exmoor farm., “I ran round the neighbours to check if they had seen them. Could someone have left a gate open? But, no, they had just gone. The first emotion was disbelief. It’s something we’d heard about in other parts of the country but not around here.”, Forty-two ewes and 10 lambs were taken, worth a total of £6,000. Among those taken were four of the farm’s 30 pure-bred Texels. “They are very much a foundation of the flock. They’re quite difficult to breed and in a few minutes they were gone,” said Coles., Her family has farmed on Exmoor for more than half a century and have never had animals stolen before. Securing the farm is not easy. “Padlocks and chains are next best to a waste of time. They’re too easy to cut.” Coles has placed bales across some gates in areas of the farm., “But I do worry,” she said. “I don’t really think the sheep are safe. It would be nice to have more police patrols as more of a deterrent but I know they don’t have the resources. You do your best, you put them where you think they’ll be safest but you can’t completely protect them.”, Rebecca Davidson, a rural affairs specialist at NFU Mutual, said rustling caused suffering to farmers and to the animals., She said: “Rustling has always been an aspect of farming but 10 years ago we would rarely see claims of more than a dozen sheep taken in one go. We are now regularly getting reports of 50-100 sheep being taken in a single raid and it is devastating for farmers., “As well as causing untold suffering to sheep, which may be in lamb when they are stolen, rustling is causing high levels of anxiety for farmers who have built up their flocks over many years., “Rustlers are getting more skilled and organised, quickly loading sheep on to trailers and lorries late at night. We are concerned that gangs are now using working sheepdogs, which have also been stolen, to get the job done.”, An alarming trend is the illegal butchery of animals in the field. Rather than having the bother of moving animals – and hiding them until they or their meat can be sold on – thieves sometimes prefer to kill them where they are, butcher the carcasses and leave the remains., Farmers and their families are devastated when they go to check their flocks to find the bloodied remains. Davidson added: “We believe that meat from stolen animals is being sold on the black market and undermining welfare standards.”, The farmers are trying to fight back. Where possible, they are grazing animals away from roads. Some are setting up devices such as infra-red beams across gates that send alerts to mobile phones if broken. But it can be costly, time-consuming and not always effective., The police insist that they do take sheep thefts seriously and understand the wide-reaching impact., PC Emily Thomas, who is investigating the Wiltshire thefts, said: “While of course there is a financial loss to the farmers, this type of theft can also have an emotional impact as in some of these circumstances it would have taken years of breeding to establish the flock. Not knowing what may have happened to the animals can be extremely upsetting.”it is devastating uk farmers despair as sheep thefts soar", "label": 0}, "train-196": {"text": "Saving the planet: UK role vital if COP 26 climate talks to succeed, As PM announces Glasgow plan, much diplomatic work remains to be done, Boris Johnson’s first steps on the international stage after Brexit will be to hail Britain’s role in forging a new global consensus on the climate crisis – although he has not yet said who will lead that charge., The UK will host the crunch UN climate talks, COP 26, this November in Glasgow, in what experts say is the last chance for international cooperation on the crisis. The prime minister, in launching the UK’s strategy for the talks on Tuesday, stops short of promising to “get climate done”, but in making his own involvement clear he will at least reassure climate activists and governments concerned at a hitherto confused and chaotic start to the UK’s presidency., Late on Friday, the Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings intervened to sack the former minister who had been slated to lead the talks, Claire O’Neill. She was accused of numerous failures in her dealings with officials, her own and those from other countries, and deemed not to have enough clout or persuasion to bring reluctant countries into the fold., No replacement has yet been announced, with rumours swirling of a Whitehall power struggle. The COP 26 unit is within the Cabinet Office, but needs strong relationships with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and with the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy. But the confusion over how the talks will be led and managed has left bystanders, including the UN, the EU and other major countries, bemused., Johnson’s re-assumption of control was essential, according to Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, and a veteran of the UN talks. “Time is running out fast, but if the prime minister takes an interest and puts his weight behind the required diplomacy, then the UK can still salvage COP 26,” he said., The task ahead is huge. The Paris accord of 2015 marked the first time that rich and poor nations came together resolving to hold global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably 1.5C, which scientists say is the limit of safety. But the Paris pledges to curb carbon emissions are inadequate. This year, governments must scale up their ambition or face climate breakdown within the decade., That effort will reach its climax in Glasgow, but the real work needs to be done now. “It really is a grind,” said Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and ex-UN commissioner for human rights, who has served twice as a UN climate envoy. “I’ve been at those ministerial meetings. You could not believe how boring some of them were. But you need to squeeze the governments, between the bottom-up – pressure from civil society – and the top-down pressure from businesses and political leaders.”, According to Tom Burke, founder of the environmental group E3G, who attended the first ever UN climate COP, the next few months are crucial. “It’s not what you’re going to do in September, October; that’s too late. It’s what you’re doing in March and April that will make the difference.”, The government’s strategy encompasses all the diplomatic and economic expertise the UK can bring to bear, from ambassadorial schmoozing in capitals from Dhaka to DC, to boardroom influence in major banks. The Prince of Wales and Prince William will also weigh in, with Charles gathering business leaders almost monthly to press them to make changes., While the UK has an enviable global network of diplomats and “soft power”, it also faces a unique difficulty. Brexit means that even while British representatives are pushing the climate agenda, separate trade negotiators are talking to the same foreign governments – in some cases even the same people in those governments – about trade deals. Several experts said they feared it would be difficult to combine the two., “Call me sceptical that Boris Johnson’s government will confront Trump’s climate nihilism ahead of Glasgow while simultaneously having to beg him for a post-Brexit trade deal,” said Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House and close observer of COPs. “Boris’s Brexit will have international climate costs, starting with lack of pressure on the US, whose lack of leadership under Trump has allowed an ultra-dangerous global climate backslide.”, The US will be tied up with its presidential election this year, and it may yet be possible to forge a deal that the US at least does not object to, even if active participation is unlikely., With regard to the other key country, China, Britain may have to rely on the negotiating might of the EU, which is arranging two major EU-China summits, in March and September, where the climate crisis will have top billing., As the last two decades of UN climate talks have shown, progress can sometimes be made even when big countries are reluctant to play ball. One of the greatest strengths of the UN process is that every country, from poorest to richest, has an equal say, and even the mightiest, from the US and China to the EU and India, have on occasion had to bow to the massed ranks of the poor and vulnerable., Building the broadest possible coalition is key, according to Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, the leading global adviser on energy. “What the world needs is a grand coalition. That means governments from around the world, but also industry and civil society.

The Texas locations of Galveston and Rockport had the next largest sea level rise increases., Generally speaking, the sea level is rising faster on the US east and Gulf coasts compared with the US west coast, partially because land on the eastern seaboard is gradually sinking., Researchers at Vims said that the current speed-up in sea level rise started around 2013 or 2014 and is probably caused by ocean dynamics and ice sheet loss. Worldwide, sea level rise is being driven by the melting of large glaciers and the thermal expansion of ocean water due to human-induced global heating., “Acceleration can be a game changer in terms of impacts and planning, so we really need to pay heed to these patterns,” said John Boon, Vims emeritus professor and founder of institute’s project to chart sea level rise., The US’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) has also reported an acceleration in sea level rise, warning that if greenhouse gas emissions are not constrained there may be a worst-case scenario of as much as a 8.2ft increase by 2100, compared with 2000 levels., The current pace of change means “we may be moving towards the higher projections”, according to Molly Mitchell, a Vims marine scientist., “We have increasing evidence from the tide-gauge records that these higher sea-level curves need to be seriously considered in resilience-planning efforts,” Mitchell said, adding that the US west coast will probably start seeing more rapid increases, akin to the east., “Although sea level has been rising very slowly along the west coast, models have been predicting that it will start to rise faster. The report cards from the past three years support this idea.”, Even at the lower end of Noaa projections, of about 12 inches of sea level rise by 2100, several US cities such as Miami and New York face considerable harm from flooding events., The climate crisis will probably drive more powerful storms, such as the recent hurricanes Irma and Harvey, which would exacerbate flooding through storm surge. sea level rise accelerating us coastline scientists warn", "label": 0}, "train-198": {"text": "\nSecret decks found on ship that capsized killing thousands of sheep\n, Discovery by salvage divers off Romania raises new questions over EU exports of live animals, \nSaeed Kamali Dehghan, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 13.22 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 10.28 EST\n\n, Secret decks for extra animals have been found in a livestock carrier that sank off the Romanian port of Midia in November drowning thousands of sheep, according to the company carrying out the massive salvage operation., Only 180 sheep survived out of the 14,600 initially believed to have been onboard the Queen Hind, which was carrying them from Romania, the EU’s biggest exporter of the animal, to Saudi Arabia., But the revelations about secret decks are likely to increase the death toll by several thousands, and raise fresh questions on whether overloading was to blame for the capsize., The vessel was left on its side in the water as it sank not far from port, with sheep corpses piling up around it. Images of the tragedy made headlines worldwide and led to renewed calls by animal activists to impose a ban on live exports from Europe to non-EU countries, particularly the Middle East and north Africa., The Romanian national daily Adevărul reported on Sunday that the firm that won the auction to bring the vessel to shore, Grup Servicii Petroliere (GSP Offshore), made its first attempt on Saturday but operations were halted after the crane’s cables were unable to bear the load., Gabriel Comănescu, GSP’s president, was quoted by Adevărul as saying that “during the operation, the divers entered the water, and found additional decks. These additional decks also have animals on board”., Comănescu added: “There are decks not included in the cargo plan, they are undeclared. It is the problem of the authorities to find out why they were loaded and why they were not included in the cargo plan. It’s a big question. There is a much larger load than over 14,000 sheep.”, Gabriel Paun, of Animals International, said the revelation “confirms our initial suspicion that the vessel capsized because of overloading”. He added: “We are outraged that this came out from the company bringing the vessel back to the shore and not from the Romanian government itself.”, Animals International said it will file complaints to the EU commission and the Romanian prosecutor’s anti-corruption department., “GSP came with the right equipment last week and they tried to lift it up with a crane and bring it to the shore,” Paun said. “They had calculated that the ship was full of water and animals, so they were prepared to lift more weight but still the cables broke.”, He had been told that the head of the company had sent down divers to investigate, and discovered secret decks loaded with thousands of animals. , Brian da Cal, UK director at the animal welfare organisation Four Paws, said he feared that the death of thousands of sheep could have been avoided., “The allegations regarding hidden decks on the ship are of huge concern and strengthens our calls for an outright ban of long-distance transports of live animals and a maximum of eight hours transportation duration. No matter how strict the rules may be and how tragic this accident is, mass deaths like this are becoming more common.”, He said Four Paws was able to rescue 254 sheep from the half-sunken ship but several died later of exhaustion and injuries – 180 survived and are now being kept in a location north of Bucharest., Paun said: “We’re saying that Romanian authorities are not to be trusted because this vessel has been inspected by the Romanian government and they’ve missed the extra decks which were not in the cargo plan.”, Paun said Romania exports about 3 million sheep annually. European live animal exports rose from a value of $1bn (£800m) in 2000 to $3.3bn in 2018., An official from the Romanian national veterinary and food safety authority, in comments carried by Adevărul, appeared to dismiss the allegations and said the vessel was heavier because “dead sheep do not have the same weight as the live ones”., A border police spokesman also dismissed the story as speculation., The Guardian has contacted MGM Marine Shipping, the management company behind the Queen Hind, for comment. The Romanian embassy was also approached.secret decks found on ship that capsized killing thousands of sheep", "label": 0}, "train-199": {"text": "\nBoris Johnson must examine the science of cheap food imports\n, PM is wrong to dismiss concerns over post-Brexit influx of low-quality food, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 12.17 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 12.31 EST\n\n, British farmers are not often called hysterical. For Boris Johnson to dismiss their concerns over food imports post-Brexit seems to show he is willing to see an influx of cheap, low-quality food that British farmers will not be able to compete with. That would hasten the decline of family-run farms, and open up the countryside further to the sort of “megafarms” common in the US., Cheap food sounds good, but Johnson has glossed over the dangers. Chlorine-washing chicken is partly an issue of animal welfare – poultry in the US are kept in filthy conditions that would be illegal here, then the carcasses are dipped in bleach. But it is one of food safety too, contrary to Johnson’s claims., If the UK’s food standards are to be science-based, as he claims, they will have to account for science that shows the washing of chicken in chlorine only masks the presence of pathogens, rather than eliminating them. That leaves the harmful germs able to carry on infecting humans after the bleach treatment., In the US, farmers are allowed to use chlorine washes and other disinfectants to remove harmful bacteria that may have infected chickens during rearing and slaughter. The EU banned the practice in 1997, leading to a long-running dispute over imports of chicken from the US., The US poultry sector has argued the ban in the EU is not based on science, but the EU is concerned that chlorine may compensate or mask poorer hygiene and animal welfare standards earlier in the food chain., The European Food Safety Authority has concluded that “chemical substances found in poultry meat are unlikely to pose an immediate or acute health threat to consumers”, but a team of microbiologists from Southampton University found in 2018 that some bacteria remained completely active after chlorine washing., Lisa O'Carroll, Brexit correspondent, Johnson’s scientists will also have to explain why serious food poisoning is a greater problem in the US than the UK. For instance, the US reports about 420 deaths each year from salmonella, while Public Health England found none in its most recent labs data. “We would like some clarity from the prime minister about how exactly he intends to keep the UK population safe from food imported from countries with lower standards than our own,” said Kath Dalmeny, the chief executive of Sustain, the food and farming alliance., Then there are the indirect impacts on human health, arguably much more alarming than food poisoning. Though the coronavirus may have come from wild animals, others such as swine flu and bird flu were associated with intensive livestock rearing., Intensive farming also requires huge inputs of antibiotics, which are leading to the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant superbugs of the kind that may soon make even routine operations life-threatening., Let the prime minister examine the science of intensive farming and food production: he will find little mumbo-jumbo and a lot to be worried about.boris johnson must examine the science of cheap food imports", "label": 0}, "train-200": {"text": "\nAustralia's biggest wheat farmer faces more charges of illegal land clearing\n, Bulldozed trees on Ron Greentree’s property caused loss of habitat for koalas and brolgas, NSW authorities allege, \nAnne Davies, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 11.35 EST\n\n, The biggest wheat farmer in Australia, Ron Greentree, is again facing charges of illegal land clearing, this time in relation to a property in western New South Wales., Greentree, the former chair of Graincorp, along with his business partner Ken Harris and their companies trading under the name the Greentree Partnership, are facing 32 charges of unauthorised land clearing at Boolcarrol, near Moree, which is alleged to have occurred between 2016 and 2019., NSW authorities allege the activities at Boolcarrol resulted in the loss of more than 1,000 hectares of native vegetation between December 2016 and January 2019., The NSW authorities allege that illegal land clearing using bulldozers and ploughs resulted in the loss of coolabah, poplar box and open woodland that was the habitat for several threatened species including the striped-faced dunnart, koalas and several bird species, such as brolgas and black cockatoos., The charges involve offences under the old Native Vegetation Act and the Local Land Services Act, which replaced it in 2017., Set down for August, it will be one of the first cases to test the NSW government’s new laws., There has been a concerted campaign from some Moree farmers and sections of the media to get the NSW government to drop cases brought under the old laws, arguing that they are causing stress to farmers during the drought. However, this case indicates the government is still pushing forward with some of the more serious allegations of land clearing under the old laws., There has already been separate legal action about whether to hear the cases against the two farmers separately or together. Harris had argued for separate trials because there has been a dispute over the partnership since early 2017 and few communications between Harris and Greentree. Justice Nicola Pain noted that between December 2016 and January 2019, when the offences were alleged to have occurred, Greentree had management of the farms while Harris had been to Boolcarrol no more than six times., Harris declined to comment. Greentree did not respond to requests for comment, nor did his lawyer., Greentree has been connected to farming controversies in the past, including some related to land clearing., In 2004 he was the first person convicted for illegal clearing of a protected wetland under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and he and his company were fined $450,000., This conviction was for clearing 100 hectares of his Windella property near Moree. The area was one of four privately owned sections of the internationally recognised Gwydir wetlands which were listed under the Ramsar Convention in 1999. He had also been facing charges in NSW., In 1998, his private company Prime Grain and Limthono, the company of a business partner, Bruce Harris, were the subject of the first prosecution for illegal clearing under the NSW Native Title Vegetation Act. This involved clearing 210 hectares of the property, Willalee, also near Moree. Both companies were convicted but received only a light fine., Last year Greentree’s Queensland business partner was fined $450,000 for illegal clearing of 2,875 hectares of native vegetation at Strathmore Station in Queensland’s Gulf country., Scott Harris, a distant relative of Ken Harris, owns the property, while Greentree is involved in farming operations to grow the northernmost cotton crop in Australia., Scott Harris is now awaiting a decision from the federal government on his plan to clear 2,000 hectares at another property, Kingvale, in Cape York. The former Newman government in Queensland had given approval for the vast property to be cleared despite concerns from environmental groups that runoff would damage the Great Barrier Reef., The federal government must also approve the clearing because it is in the Barrier Reef catchment. A decision is expected any day., The looming Kingvale decision has been highly controversial. Documents released under freedom of information laws revealed four Coalition senators from Queensland lobbied then-environment minister Josh Frydenberg in 2018 to approve it., The approval was then overturned by the federal court on technical grounds and the decision must be remade by the current environment minister, Sussan Ley., Meanwhile the Queensland Department of Environment and Science is taking court action as a result of an investigation in 2016, when the Olkola people complained to the government that they believed Kingvale Station may be in breach of the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act.australias biggest wheat farmer faces more charges of illegal land clearing", "label": 0}, "train-201": {"text": "\nShare your photos and stories of early signs of spring\n, We want your help documenting the situation as record temperatures bring early signs of spring across Europe, \nGuardian community team, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 07.22 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 07.25 EST\n\n, With warmer winters and seasonal changes we would like to know about any early signs of spring you have spotted near you., From joy at seeing beautiful scenes to concern about what it means for the environment, you can see what Guardian readers told us last year., Tell us what the situation is like where you are in the encrypted form below.

About 30 koalas had been euthanised., The Victorian environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said on Monday the event was “devastating” for the koala population in the Portland region and pledged the government would do “everything possible” to bring the perpetrators to account., “Every Victorian can rightly feel not only appalled, deeply saddened and heartbroken, but angry. I am absolutely angry.”, Locals reported the incident to the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), which arrived on site on Friday., Portland resident Helen Oakley posted a video from the site. In the video, she said: “Look at the destruction that they have done and there’s koalas lying there dead ... and there are mothers killed with their little babies. Australia should be ashamed of this.”, Victoria’s chief conservation regulator, Kate Gavens, said more than 80 koalas had been assessed since Friday and at least 30 had been euthanised., On Monday she said 40 koalas had died, but that number was likely to rise. “There’s about 10 kilometres of felled timber that we have to get through.”, Surviving koalas were being moved to wildlife carers for treatment and rehabilitation, and carers and vets were on site., “The conservation regulator’s major investigations team is leading the investigation into how this incident happened and who was responsible,” Gavens said. “Animals that were considered to not require immediate removal have been provided with food and water., “DELWP are working with the relevant parties on the long-term requirements for the remaining koalas – this may include translocation to suitable sites.”, Andy Meddick, a Victorian state Animal Justice Party MP, visited the site on Sunday and told Guardian Australia the trees in the blue gum plantation had been “bulldozed into piles” around the property., “I saw at least 10 bodies in just one of those piles,” he said. “A couple had literally been crushed to death when these trees have been uprooted. In one instance, a koala had her arm stuck between two branches and she had starved to death. Animals have been killed, injured and left to starve by whoever has done this.”, D’Ambrosio described the incident as “abysmal”, saying: “We will do everything possible to bring the people responsible for this to account and will throw every penalty available to us at them.”, She said the government would consider breaches of both the Wildlife Act and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act., Under the Wildlife Act, the conservation regulator said, killing, harassing or disturbing wildlife could attract a penalty of up to $8,000 and an additional fine of more than $800 per head of wildlife.  A crime scene had also been established at Cape Bridgewater., A logging company, South West Fibre, said it had been engaged to harvest timber from the site in October 2019 and handed the area back the following month., The company said in a statement: “SWF left an appropriate number of ‘habitat trees’ for the existing koala population and provided details of such in a letter to the landowner noting that the koalas were uninjured and in good health., “It is understood that subsequent to SWF completing its work, the remaining trees have since been cleared. This is particularly concerning to the foresters and staff who worked assiduously to protect the koalas during the harvesting operation.”, A company spokesperson said it handed the site back to the owner in mid-November with 72 koalas on site, leaving 10 hectares of “remnant vegetation” on site., According to the Age, the property is run by Keith Troeth on behalf of his father Russell Troeth. Keith Troeth told the newspaper he had cleared the site last week to return it to pasture., “We made every effort to do it professionally, we made every effort to minimise any fatality,” he said. “There may have been one or two koalas killed and I’ll wear the responsibility, but it’s not the big hoo-ha it’s been made out to be.”,  Russell Troeth declined to comment, referring Guardian Australia to a phone number for staff at the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning., The Australian Forest Products Association (AFPA) said it was launching its own investigation and that the industry was “appalled” at what it described as a “callous act of animal cruelty”., The association’s chief executive, Ross Hampton, said forestry operators “scrupulously and meticulously follow koala preservation procedures overseen by the Department of Environment in Victoria”., “I’m advised that the operators in this case were so careful that they even took an injured koala, which they found during inspection, to the vet,” he said. “I’m advised harvest of this area ended in November and the land was handed back to the owner before Christmas., “It is unclear as yet who bulldozed the trees with the koalas apparently still in them, but it is absolutely certain that this was not a plantation or a forestry company. We support all those calling for the full force of the law to be applied to the perpetrator., “AFPA will be launching its own investigation. Furthermore, we will be ensuring that none of the timber which has been cleared is touched by any AFPA member.”koala massacre animals reported starving or dead after plantation logging", "label": 0}, "train-203": {"text": "\nLoss of EU protections could imperil UK hedgehogs, report says\n, New rules do not contain same level of safeguards as under common agricultural policy, \nPhoebe Weston, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 06.43 EST\n\n, Britain’s hedgehogs could be at greater risk after Brexit because hedges may no longer be protected by agriculture regulations, a report says., Under EU law, hedgerows cannot be cut during the bird nesting season and two-metre wild “buffer” strips cannot be doused with pesticides or ploughed up. This is designed to protect hedgerow habitats that provide refuge for 80% of woodland birds and 50% of all mammals., The new agriculture bill reveals gaps in domestic legislation, meaning there is not the same level of protection as under the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP), according to the report by the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP), commissioned by the Wildlife Trusts, RSPB and WWF., This could mean a significant loss of habitat for the country’s dwindling hedgehog population, which has already fallen by 97% since the 1950s, according to a 2018 report., Nests of woodland and farmland birds such as linnets, yellowhammer and turtle doves could also be destroyed. Mammals such as field voles and hazel dormice are also at risk., “Hedgerows may just be dividers between crops to us, but they are often hidden worlds, teeming with the amazing wildlife that calls our farmland home,” said Tom Lancaster, head of land, seas and climate policy at the RSPB., Bird nesting season runs from February to August. Under the CAP, farmers are not allowed to trim hedges between 1 March and 1 September. EU law says buffer strips must be two metres wide and must not have fertilisers or pesticides put on them., These protections are not contained in the new legislation being debated in the House of Commons., The bill moves away from a system where farmers receive subsidies based on how much land they farm to a process where they receive money for public goods such as providing habitats for wildlife and maintaining healthy soils., Campaigners are lobbying the government to make sure every farmer meets minimum environmental standards after Britain leaves the EU, not just those that sign up for wildlife subsidies., “The agriculture bill includes vital new powers to pay farmers to restore nature but is silent on the rules and regulations for farming in the future. With the change that Brexit will bring, this presents real risks to our soils and hedgerows, and the nature that depends upon them,” Lancaster said., There is already a gap in domestic and EU regulations that means farmers can fill in ponds or leave them to become overgrown. Campaigners want this addressed in the new regulations because ponds support a large proportion of freshwater biodiversity, especially uncommon freshwater species such as damselflies. The report also flags a lack of protection for bare soils., Debbie Tripley, the director of environmental policy and advocacy at WWF, said: “Unless the government starts plugging the gaps left by leaving EU regulation, our soils, hedgerows and the wildlife that depends on them are at risk. We need firm but fair enforcement and advice that ensure food is produced to high environmental standards across the country.”, Cutting hedgerows during nesting season could be “calamitous” for wild pollinators and birds, says Lynn Dicks, a lecturer in animal ecology from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the research., “Hedgerows are really important for wild pollinators, especially because they provide flower resources in the early spring, often when not much else is in flower., “If hedgerows are more frequently cut in the spring and early summer, a practice that currently breeches EU regulations, substantial proportions of this spring flower resource in the English countryside could be lost. A third of our wild bee and hoverfly species are already declining. Loss of flowers in the hedgerows can only make this worse.”, Alexander Lees, senior lecturer in conservation biology at Manchester Metropolitan University said: “It seems ridiculous that we should have to worry that legislation to protect our natural capital like soils and clean water might be eroded, no forward thinking nation should ever contemplate such acts of self-harm, yet our current track record at enforcement of regulation is already very poor.”, A Defra spokesperson said: “We will continue to be a world leader on the environment as we leave the EU and both the agriculture bill and the environment bill are a crucial part of that., “We will not lower the exceptionally high environmental standards we already hold. In fact, leaving the EU means we can transform British agriculture to reward farmers for enhancing the environment, tackling climate change and protecting our wildlife for future generations.”loss of eu protections could imperil uk hedgehogs report says aoe", "label": 0}, "train-204": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a sparrowhawk rises in circles, silencing the birdsong\n, Airedale, West Yorkshire: The birds wear the same colours and sing much the same songs, but the world has turned and everything is different , \nRichard Smyth, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, It would be tempting to just write: “Ditto.

Siskins bother the alder-tops and a bullfinch toots mournfully from a sycamore thicket. A wintering little grebe, looking as small and vulnerable as a duckling, circles at the river’s edge. A roe deer kicks up its back end, flashing its scut., But on the other hand, in other ways, everything has changed. Everyone here is a little older, has learned a little more. A year’s worth of weather has blown through the woods. Most of these birds (long-tailed tits milling in the middle storey, blue tits making their rattlesnake alarm-calls, song thrushes maintaining a strong line in jibber-jabber from the tree-forks) won’t be the same birds as were here last year, though they wear the same colours and sing much the same songs.

Someone has flytipped a van-load of car tyres on the opposite side of the river: they slobber down the bank like a clutch of giant frogspawn. The great riven tree beside the dry stream-bed has split a bit wider open, and brambles have found their way inside the trunk.

To the left, on a branch overlooking the uncut scrub between the meadow and a car-radiator factory, a male kestrel is perched, grey head bowed as he studies the undergrowth for movement.

The talks, to take place in Glasgow this November, are widely seen as the last realistic chance for countries to pledge the stiff cuts needed in greenhouse gases to stave off climate breakdown., But the strategy was plunged into confusion on Friday night as the intended leader of the talks, former energy minister Claire O’Neill, was abruptly sacked., Her sudden removal, by the prime minister’s adviser Dominic Cummings, has left a vacuum that the government said would be filled by a minister., While some observers were encouraged that a more heavyweight politician than O’Neill could take the stage, there were concerns that if responsibility for the negotiations is taken on by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, that will mean the same officials and politicians who are trying to sign post-Brexit trade deals will also be trying to persuade recalcitrant governments to renew their commitments to cutting carbon., The potential conflicts of interest were clearly illustrated at the UK-Africa summit less than a fortnight ago, when Boris Johnson boasted of ending UK funding of coal-fired power plants in Africa – though there had been no such funding since 2002. But at the same conference, nearly £2bn of investment was poured into African oil and gas., Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, and a long-time observer at the annual UN talks, said: “So far it doesn’t seem like there is a clear vision for Glasgow. The recent UK-Africa summit was a huge missed opportunity to make climate a major theme. And 90% of the energy deals done at the summit were on oil and gas, suggesting that climate change was merely being used as greenwashing veneer.”, The head of one major international NGO said civil society groups were “not convinced” that the UK could skirt the potential conflicts of interest. “It is very delicate and it’s going to be very interesting to see how they do this.”, The media will be largely excluded from Tuesday’s launch, apparently at the behest of Downing Street. That is unusual, as the UN’s climate change secretariat is sensitive to being seen as open and transparent., Tom Burke, founder of the environmental group E3G, said it was encouraging that Downing Street was playing a greater role in COP26, however. “That Dominic Cummings has done this sacking O’Neill suggests a political motivation, and shows they realise how important it is to get this right.”, Forging a global consensus on urgent action on the climate will not be easy. The Paris accord of 2015 marked the first time that rich and poor nations came together resolving to hold global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably 1.5C, which scientists say is the limit of safety., The Paris pledges to curb carbon emissions are inadequate, however, and at COP26, governments must scale up their ambition, or face climate breakdown within the decade. The most recent round of talks, in Madrid in December, were fractious and ended in only a partial agreement, showing little of the spirit of cooperation that will be needed to make COP26 a success., Other developing countries told the Guardian that the sacking of O’Neill was “at best disruptive” but that if Johnson took swift control and appointed a political heavyweight who could inspire confidence in global capitals, the damage could be limited., There were concerns over O’Neill’s handling of the negotiations to date, as O’Neill appeared to downplay the importance of the Paris agreement and gave conflicting opinions of what should be achieved at COP26., O’Neill had already embarked in recent months on a busy programme of meeting environment ministers and negotiating teams from around the world. She attended the last UN talks in Madrid in December, and went to Dhaka to see Sheikh Hasina Wazed, Bangladesh’s prime minister, who will play a pivotal role in the talks as leader of the Climate Vulnerable Forum group of 50 countries. Those meetings will need to be replicated and relationships rebuilt after her departure., Saleemul Huq, of the International Institute for Environment and Development, a COP veteran, said: “The UK will need those countries.

As farmers lose direct payments under the common agricultural policy, critics say some EU regulations could also fall away., These include specific protections for hedgerows, not cutting them during the breeding seasons and maintaining a buffer strip at their base to protect plants and safeguard species including yellowhammers, small mammals, pollinator insects and pond-dwelling amphibians., As the bill stands, there are no domestic regulations to replace them, and nothing to indicate how any regulations, current and future, will be enforced, say critics., The reports said a new system of regulation is needed. The three wildlife charities want the new Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), which replaces European oversight of environmental protections, to have powers to police and implement regulations, and all farmers to comply irrespective of whether they receive public funding., Ellie Brodie, from The Wildlife Trusts, said: “We’re really concerned that the agriculture bill does not contain the regulation that’s so desperately needed and nature will continue to take the rap.”, “Gaps must be filled and enforcement must be strengthened if we’re to address the nature crisis and climate emergency.”, Tom Lancaster, of the RSPB, said: “The agriculture bill includes vital new powers to pay farmers to restore nature, but is silent on the rules and regulations for farming in the future. With the change that Brexit will bring, this presents real risks to our soils and hedgerows, and the nature that depends on them.”, Debbie Tripley, of the WWF, said: “Unless the government starts plugging the gaps left by EU regulation, our soils, hedgerows and the wildlife that depends on them are at risk”., A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: “We will continue to be a world leader on the environment as we leave the EU and both the agriculture bill and the environment bill are a crucial part of that., “We will not lower the exceptionally high environmental standards we already hold. In fact, leaving the EU means we can transform British agriculture to reward farmers for enhancing the environment, tackling climate change and protecting our wildlife for future generations.”uk wildlife at risk due to regulatory gaps created by brexit says report", "label": 0}, "train-207": {"text": "\nJohnson sets out his climate crisis vision as Cameron turns down talks role\n, PM reaffirms 2050 net-zero pledge but his predecessor declines offer to lead UK preparations for crucial summit, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 18.28 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Tue 4 Feb 2020 13.51 EST\n\n, Boris Johnson has set out his vision for forging a new global consensus on the climate crisis promising “we will crack it”, amid news that he approached former prime minister David Cameron to lead the UK’s preparations for a crucial summit., Johnson has brought forward the UK’s phaseout of diesel and petrol vehicles by five years to 2035, and hastened the phaseout of coal-fired power by a year to 2024. He reaffirmed the UK’s pledge to switch to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050, and urged other nations – without naming any – to do the same., “I hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero within decades,” Johnson said at the COP 26 launch on Tuesday. “We’re going to do it by 2050, we’re setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us. Let’s make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve manmade climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren.”, But the troubled start to the UK’s presidency of this year’s crunch UN climate talks with the sacking of Claire O’Neill as COP president has unsettled observers, who are hoping Johnson will play a pivotal role in bringing world leaders together with a new resolve to drastically reduce greenhouse-gas emissions before it is too late., On Tuesday night it emerged that Johnson had approached Cameron to take over from O’Neill but he declined the role., Lord Barker of Battle, who served as an energy and climate change minister under Cameron and is a close friend and ally of the former prime minister, said he understood reports that he was offered the role to be correct. “My understanding is that he felt it was just a little too soon for him personally to come back into a frontline political role,” he told BBC Two’s Newsnight., William Hague was also reported to have been offered it but also declined., The appointment last year of O’Neill as president – the official who will take the leading role in convening and chairing the fortnight-long UN talks, and seeing them through to a deal which will require the consensus of 196 nations – appeared to give the UK a good headstart in the talks., O’Neill was formerly an energy minister in the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, below the secretary of state level but with rights to attend Theresa May’s cabinet meetings. She resigned as the MP for Devizes, a staunchly Conservative seat, after taking on the role, saying she wanted to concentrate on the COP presidency., Brexit was also a major factor. O’Neill campaigned to remain in the referendum, and was scathing of hard Brexiters, whom she accused of being “hysterical” and “like jihadis”. She rebelled to vote for a Brexit bill amendment that would give parliament the final say on any deal to leave the EU, though she voted with her party on other legislation., She wished Johnson good luck with Brexit when she gave notice last September, well before a election had been called, that she would not contest the seat again., O’Neill was a surprise choice for the president’s role, but the political turmoil last autumn made her a relatively safe pick: with the government preoccupied with Brexit, and Johnson both struggling to get the general election he wanted and filling the cabinet with pro-Brexit supporters of his leadership campaign, to appoint a serving minister would have been tricky., Other possible candidates included Zac Goldsmith, whose shaky reelection prospects were borne out by his defeat in Richmond, or members of the House of Lords., O’Neill’s experience as a transport minister and energy minister seemed to offer some assurance. However, her record was also spotted. In November 2018 three unions wrote to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to raise allegations of shouting and swearing at civil servants. In her post-sacking letter this week, O’Neill rebuffed those allegations., The Guardian was given mixed reports of her conduct in the UN negotiations by people present. She is said to have created a good impression among some countries, and at some meetings at last December’s climate conference in Madrid. However, she fell out with some senior officials in the UK, and gave conflicting messages about the UK’s position and strategy at the talks., O’Neill’s letter to Johnson also gives clues to the concerns over her conduct. In it, she is strongly critical of the COP structure, rules and bureaucracy, but without showing much awareness of what supporters see as the value of the process – which gives all nations an equal voice, and progresses by consensus – or respect for the negotiators, many of whom have served their governments for decades., “COP is difficult, but you need to understand it and work within it,” said one long-time participant in the UN talks. “The French did when they led the 2015 Paris agreement.”, Another former high-level diplomat and COP veteran said: “A good COP president makes all the difference between success and failure. They direct the negotiations, they play the key role in determining the outcome.”, It is also clear, however, that O’Neill has suffered from a lack of support within government, and a lack of focus from the prime minister on the UK’s COP 26 plans. She complained that the cabinet sub-committee on climate, supposed to be chaired by Johnson, has not yet met. The relationship between the COP 26 unit and other government departments is also unclear in parts, and it is not apparent that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been pushing climate to the top of the agenda in its embassies around the world, as the French did before Paris., Bedevilling all this has been Brexit. Several NGOs and developing country representatives told the Guardian about serious concerns that the UK could not give COP 26 the attention needed while still working out its new relationships and trade deals., Some observers see a potential conflict of interest, as British diplomats seek at once to gain support for a COP 26 resolution that will require other countries to set out stretching goals on cutting emissions, while also negotiating post-Brexit trade deals. “I am very concerned about how they can play this,” said the head of one international civil society group. “This is a very delicate dance.”, Paul Bledsoe, a former climate advisrr to Bill Clinton, said: “Sacking O’Neill and making the post more directly reportable to Number 10 increases the pressure on Johnson to appoint an aggressive climate policy figure, especially one who will actually hold the Chinese and Americans accountable.”, With O’Neill’ssacking, climate activists and COP participants are hoping that now Johnson and his government can move on to forge a clear strategy and timetable for gaining the support and buy-in they need from capitals across the world. But they warn that the prime minister is running out of time., “The prime minister has given a very clear and strong message, which is good,” said Lord Stern, the climate economist. “He has made a personal commitment, and that is now crystal clear. Now we need someone in a very senior position to be COP president. The challenge now is to accelerate.”, • This article was amended on 6 February 2020 because an earlier version referred to O’Neill’s “resignation letter”.

On Monday she wrote a letter to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, saying the UK is “miles off track” and accusing Johnson of showing a lack of leadership., Here is the text of her letter, and the Guardian’s analysis of what her words really mean., Dear prime minister,, I was surprised and dismayed to be phoned by Dominic Cummings last Friday to be told I was no longer required to act as your COP (Conference of the UN Parties) President., I was given three separate explanations for the decision, none of which could be clearly articulated or supported with evidence, apart from needing someone more senior. You did, of course, know my seniority and experience when you offered me the job and my track record of delivery from persuading the Cabinet to host COP26, winning the COP bid in partnership with Italy, publishing the Clean Growth Strategy, introducing our historic Net Zero legislation, launching the global Powering Past Coal Alliance and negotiating the Offshore Wind Sector Deal that has made our vast offshore renewable energy source cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives., It was very disheartening in this context to learn that No. 10 is rumoured to be behind the media briefings put out to support your decision, which variously contained awful, false and distorted defamatory allegations. To take two examples: “bullying allegations” were referred to, when you are aware that there was a single historical complaint, which was fully investigated by the Cabinet office and found to be entirely without merit., Claire O’Neill – known by her previous married name of Claire Perry until her second marriage in 2018 – was best known before her appointment as COP president for a series of colourful incidents. Early on, she had to apologise to parliament for asking aloud who she needed to “give a blowjob to” in order to be called on to speak. Later, she put down David Davies when he mixed her up with another Tory woman in cabinet. Most seriously, the Guardian uncovered an alleged incident in which three unions complained to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy that she had shouted and sworn at civil servants., Equally, reports of ‘problems on international engagements’ stemmed from a single blog post which I believe can be completely rebutted by the emails, reports and public statements from our ambassadors and international stakeholders. Just for good measure, almost every negative media story (and none of the good stuff) over the last eleven years was included in the briefings just to spice them up and to detract from the real failings and real concerns about the COP26 process and progress. Given my track record and our long and honest working relationship that is quite disgraceful., The Guardian has received mixed reports of O’Neill’s performance in the role, with some saying she made a good impression in foreign capitals and at the UN’s Madrid climate conference last year. However, there have also been reports of her falling out with senior UK officials and giving confusing and contradictory messages to other countries on the UK’s COP 26 strategy., But let’s leave my disappointment with the firing process and No. 10’s apparent dark ops to one side, and focus on the real issue. We are almost out of time to win the battle against climate change and start the process of climate recovery., C02 levels are over 415 ppm and climbing. The last time we saw numbers like this was three million years ago when sea levels were 20 metres higher than now and beech trees grew in Antarctica., Interestingly, Johnson phrased this point almost identically at the launch of the COP 26 strategy on Tuesday morning at the Science Museum in London., The world’s attempts to get to grips with this epic Tragedy of the Commons are failing. Almost 50 per cent of our collective emissions have been pumped out since the first meeting of global leaders on climate at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and emissions are 4 per cent higher than in 2015 when the Paris agreement was signed at COP21. Global scientists are clear that unless we break this trend now and start sustained reduction in global emissions with a clear net zero landing zone by 2050 or shortly afterwards, we will be dealing with unprecedented climate conditions and vast economic and human consequences within decades, not centuries., This is a good summary of scientific warnings to date., It became clear to me as the UK Climate and Energy Minister that the current format of the global COP talks needed to be re-energized and focused if we are to reach any form of meaningful global action plan for climate recovery. This is also the view of previous COP presidents and negotiators, UN climate experts, climate activists and commentators whom we consulted. The annual UN talks are dogged by endless rows over agendas, ongoing unresolved splits over who should pay and insufficient attention and funding for adaptation and resilience., O’Neill’s criticisms of the annual UN talks have some valid points, and all COP attendees would agree that many of the processes are bureaucratic and tedious. However, O’Neill fails to acknowledge the real value of the COP process – this is the only forum in which the world gathers as a whole to thrash out a global answer to the climate crisis. Everyone complains about the COP, but it is hard to imagine how it could be replaced with an equally democratic process involving all countries – and there is no time to invent a new process from scratch, given the urgency of the problem. A good COP president is expected to understand intimately the COP structures and work within them – the French managed to do so triumphantly in 2015, using the existing rules to fashion a bold new agreement., We can’t agree how to make the necessary transitions in a just and fair way, and the COP offers no permanent place to celebrate and recognise the action and optimism of the cities, states and businesses who have committed themselves to the huge growth opportunity arising from the shift to a low carbon economy and the enormous co-benefits in terms of health, air quality and welfare that this can bring., It was particularly awful at the last COP in Madrid, despite the best efforts of the wonderful Chilean President and Spanish hosts. While half a million climate action protestors gathered in the streets, I sat in plenary sessions where global negotiators debated whether our meeting should be classified as “Informal” or “Informal-Informal”; others argued over the structure of tabs, tables and colours in reports (rather than the commitments countries would make) and some of the world’s wealthiest oil-rich countries made their annual demand for global funding to offset the damage all this low carbon planning would do to their economy. Some teams did rise above the negativity and made amazing progress in delivering things like the Gender Action Plan but there is a yawning gap between what the world expects from us and where we are. You can’t fault the negotiators for doing their jobs sometimes under awful circumstances– it’s a systemic failure of global vision and leadership., Again, O’Neill makes fair points, and the gap between the energy of the activists and the snail’s-pace progress of the talks was most marked at Madrid. But the Chilean presidency will continue until November, so the UK must work with Chilean diplomats and show respect for the office and the UN., That is why I asked you to support the UK and Italy COP bid as a leadership candidate and then promised you the most ambitious COP ever when you appointed me President. Together with our Advisors and the COP team I produced a Action Plan for the next decade built on seven aims:, 1. Using the UK’s incredible global diplomatic resources to ensure every Paris signatory is supported to bring forward an updated Nationally Determined Contribution this year, as they are required to do under the terms of the Paris Agreement., The Paris agreement requires countries to communicate their nationally determined contributions after five years, stating that this should “represent a progression” from current targets, and also provides for a global stocktake in 2023 to assess progress., 2. Setting Net Zero as the clear science-based target for all climate ambition from countries, businesses, states and cities and make this the Net Zero COP., The call for net zero emissions by 2050 is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s landmark assessment of the threat of global heating in 2018., 3. Introducing a properly-funded global package for adaptation and resilience building., A longstanding aim of developing countries., 4. Placing nature-based solutions at the heart of the climate recovery agenda, with more funding, a new global transparent Nature Exchange for all carbon credits, a new global goal for tree protection and planting and an international rollout of plans for more sustainable supply chains., While forestry will play an important part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and providing carbon sinks, this goal goes further than the Paris agreement provides for. Forests and carbon credits based on them are tricky issues at COPs – last December’s COP in Madrid could not agree on a new global system for carbon credits. For the UK to set this as a top goal could help to bring recalcitrant countries such as Brazil on board, or could prove a timewasting distraction., 5. Embedding in COP26 and future events a strong Clean Growth agenda, including: a financial and strategic package to accelerate coal phase-out; a single global measure of the emissions reduction plans of companies, cities and states; new Net Zero sector deals from some of the hardest to decarbonise sectors and a repurposed Mission Innovation focused on outcomes like scaled up green hydrogen production., There is little indication so far of how the UK aims to achieve these detailed goals., 6. Aligning global financial flows with emissions reductions and pricing of physical climate risk, working with private finance, development banks, central banks and regulators., Finance for moving to a green economy – in particular, the role of rich countries in helping developing nations with investment – is a perennial issue at the UN talks. While rich countries pledged that $100bn (£77bn) a year would flow to the developing world by 2020, there are conflicting views on how to count this cash., 7. Aiming to close the Paris Rulebook on time this year, while recognising that implementation can begin immediately among countries who have “opted-in” to the rules already agreed and opening the negotiations and COP processes to public scrutiny so the citizens of the world can be our audience., We planned something else too – a celebration of the UK’s action in cutting its emissions more than any other developed country, a Four Nations COP with every part of the UK involved and a year of Climate Action for the whole of society to create a coming together after the Brexit battles with one common goal of climate recovery., Johnson also plans to use COP26 as a national showcase – he highlighted the UK’s technological innovations at the strategy launch on Tuesday, and boasted that Britain had cut emissions while increasing GDP since 1990., A great agenda. But we are miles off track. When you asked me to be your COP President (and to combine it with remaining in your Cabinet as a Minister, an offer I declined) you promised to “lead from the front” and asked me what was needed “money, people, just tell us!” Sadly, these promises and offers are not close to being met., • The Cabinet sub-committee on climate that you promised to chair, and which I was to attend, has not met once., • In the absence of your promised leadership and Cabinet agreement, and despite the best efforts of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, departments have fought internal Whitehall battles over who is responsible and accountable for COP actions and made the work of the COP unit to drive forward plans and preparation so much harder. At this stage, we should have clear actions to communicate to the diplomatic network, an agreed plan of Ministerial international engagements led by you from now until November and a roadmap for the Year of Action. As of last Friday, we did not., This shows how far behind the UK is already on what observers think a successful strategy should be. By this stage in 2015, the French government had long embarked on a global charm offensive through its embassies, aimed at bringing all countries, large and small, on board with senior diplomats around the world briefed to bring up climate change at every meeting., • I am told by COP unit sources that budgets (which I do not see) are ballooning, the team and the Scottish government are in an extraordinary state of stand-off and that you are considering re-locating the event to an English location. I had asked if you would consider resetting your relationship with the First Minister – putting aside the devolution battle for the sake of this vastly more important agenda. I understand you declined in salty terms., The Scottish government and UK government are currently arguing over the use of a building near the COP26 venue during the conference. It had been rumoured that Johnson was considering a change of venue, though Whitehall sources insisted on Tuesday that would not happen. My colleague Severin Carrell has written in more detail on this here., • The COP Delivery unit, led by and staffed by some of the best and brightest people Whitehall has had to offer and supported by an all-star Advisory Group of global climate leaders has had to battle for every resource, jump through every possible internal process hoop and been prohibited from hiring in outside talent with appropriate experience such as Olympics delivery experts. Not surprisingly this has been extremely stressful for them and they are stretched to the limit., As you will know from my contract, I do not have responsibility for any of these items and the COP team do not report to me., It is surprising that O’Neill’s powers appear so circumscribed. Her successor, as a serving minister, may have greater latitude., You will also know from years of working with me that I could not stand by and see this extraordinary opportunity fail for lack of any leadership and so have tried to intervene in some of the worst of the process and ambition blocks and maintain momentum but my intercessions have regretfully been perceived as undermining rather than supportive as is so often the case when “politicians” meddle with the workings of Whitehall. And it is also fair to say that some officials have found the need for action and real change to be threatening to the COP status quo – for some it is hard to give up on incrementalism even when it is demonstrably failing., This gives an insight into the rows O’Neill is said to have had with senior officials. Criticising the lack of progress at COPs is one thing, but falling out with experienced officials is a mistake – a failure to understand the complex UN procedures and rules was one of the factors that doomed the Danish government at the Copenhagen COP in 2009, which ended in scenes of chaos and disarray., In my judgement this isn’t a pretty place to be and we owe the world a lot better. We must move on from Whitehall knot-tying, infighting and obfuscation, petty political squabbles and black ops briefings to real sustained engagement, maximum global ambition, open-hearted international cooperation, joined-up action and alliance building. To do that will require a whole of government reset and for your team to move the vast and immediate challenge of climate recovery to the top of the Premier League of their priorities from where it is now - stuck currently somewhere around the middle of League One., I hope you will use my sacking as a moment to reset the dial and make these changes happen and I wish my successor every possible success. I will continue to do whatever I can to support the best possible outcomes for this COP that has been in gestation for so long that it feels like my fourth child. But I will do so joyfully free from political patronage and pretence, cheering on progress and calling out greenwash, empty promises, dither, and delay., I know you like quotes. So, let me end this long letter with one from Proverbs: Where there is no vision, the people perish., You had a vision for Brexit and you got Brexit done. As I write, we have less than 7,000 hours before the start of COP26 where we have a chance to set a new global vision for climate recovery and build a new consensus for global climate action. Please get this done too., Yours ever,, Rt.

The report focuses on EU countries and was produced for the Tapp Coalition of health, environment and animal welfare organisations. It says “fair pricing” for meat should be included in the forthcoming European “green new deal” and so-called farm to fork strategy., The report, produced by environmental research group CE Delft, analysed the costs of greenhouse gas emissions, other air and water pollution, and losses of wildlife associated with livestock production. It estimated that covering these costs would increase the price of beef by €0.47 (40p) per 100g. This would increase the cost of a 227g supermarket steak in the UK by about 25%., The levy on pork and chicken would be lower owing to their smaller environmental impact, at €0.36 (31p)/100g and €0.17 (14p)/100g respectively. The report suggests such charges could reduce consumption of beef in the EU by 67%, pork by 57% and chicken by 30% by 2030., As well as reducing emissions by 120m tonnes a year, the charges would raise €32bn a year for EU member states, according to the report., The Tapp Coalition said about half of this should be given to help farmers move their production away from meat, which could increase individual farm incomes by thousands of euros per year., The rest should be used to reduce the cost of fruit and vegetables, support poorer families and help developing countries deal with the climate crisis., Jeroom Remmers, a Tapp Coalition director, said: “Europeans eat roughly 50% more meat than is recommended in dietary health guidelines. So we could also save billions of euros every year in lower healthcare costs.”, In November, three European health associations wrote to Frans Timmermans, the senior European commissioner leading the green new deal initiative. They said: “Numerous studies in recent years have shown that a shift to healthy, more plant-rich diets can deliver important health, environmental and economic benefits.”, A carbon tax on high-impact food is also backed by a second report, from the Behavioural Insights Team (Bit), a social purpose company part-owned by the UK government. It further suggests making plant-based food the default choice at catered events or on flights., Recent research has shown that a huge reduction in meat-eating in rich nations is essential to tackle the climate emergency. Other work indicates that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet., “Including the environmental cost of animal protein in the price is a crucial element of meeting EU targets for climate, biodiversity, public health, and animal welfare,” said Prof Pier Vellinga at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and chair of the Tapp Coalition., The report from Bit, also known as the “nudge unit” set up by David Cameron in 2010, examines how governments, the food industry and campaign groups can help shift diets away from meat., As well as supporting a carbon tax on high-impact food, it says governments could lead by example, by “removing or reducing unsustainable foods from public canteens in hospitals, schools and government offices”. It also says practical cooking skills could be taught in schools and colleges., Food companies could make plant-based products the default choice, for example at catered events or on flights, the Bit report said. It also suggested marketing plant-based food as “delicious, normal, and satisfying, not as light, abstemious, or overtly healthy or vegetarian”. Another proposal is placing veggie burgers alongside their meat counterparts instead of separating them on menus or in supermarket aisles., The report said campaign groups could reduce the perceived complexity of sustainable eating by promoting clear rules of thumb, such as “red meat’s a treat”., Toby Park, the head of energy and sustainability at Bit, said: “Governments, industry and consumers around the world are more aware than ever of the need to live within our planet’s means., “While some of the solutions will come from technical advancements, there is huge potential and need to reduce our environmental impacts with some simple behaviour changes.”, In the UK, the National Farmers’ Union says agriculture can become climate neutral by 2040 without cutting beef production. Instead, it says three-quarters of farming emissions can be offset by growing fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide.eu meat tax climate emergency", "label": 0}, "train-210": {"text": "\nHolyrood and UK ministers in row about possible COP 26 venue\n, Scottish government accused of behaving disgracefully over use of Glasgow science centre , \nSeverin Carrell Scotland editor, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 11.50 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 12.16 EST\n\n, Preparations for this year’s climate summit in Glasgow are being overshadowed by a bitter row between the UK and Scottish governments over a key building near the venue., UK government sources have accused Scottish ministers of refusing to hand over a building the Scottish government wants to use as its base for the COP 26 climate talks in November., Scottish ministers say they booked the Glasgow science centre, a publicly funded venue on the opposite bank of the Clyde from the main conference site, only after the UK government said it would be outside the summit security zone last November., The dispute deepened after Claire O’Neill, the former minister who was sacked as the summit’s chair by Boris Johnson last week, alleged the two governments “were in an extraordinary state of standoff” over the event., O’Neill told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that she had been told the Scottish government had “behaved disgracefully” by booking buildings on the summit site – a claim rejected by Scottish government officials and independent sources., In a letter to the prime minister published by the FT, O’Neill said that Johnson was even considering moving the event to an English city because of “ballooning costs”. That claim was rejected by a Whitehall source who said there was “zero chance” of it being relocated., O’Neill told Today that the “playground politics, the yah boo of this, has to stop”. She suggested to Johnson that Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, be given a key role at the summit which “the prime minister heartily and saltily rebutted.”, Spurred on by O’Neill’s disclosure, Sturgeon wrote to Johnson on Tuesday afternoon asking him to allow Scotland’s environment and climate secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, to take part in climate change ministerial meetings that he has promised to chair in London., Johnson is very likely to reject that request. At the Conservative’s conference in October, he told a raucous Scottish Tory fringe event that he did not want Sturgeon “anywhere near” the climate summit., The spat deepened after a Whitehall source said that the Scottish government had failed to reply to a formal request from Michael Gove in mid-January to relinquish use of the centre and hand it to the climate summit secretariat., A spokesman for Sturgeon insisted her government was willing to discuss how the centre could be used. Ministers in Edinburgh were open to the idea of sharing it, he said, but refused to confirm that they would vacate the building entirely., “It’s a mischaracterisation of our position to suggest we’ve been behaving in anything other than a responsible or cooperative way over the organisation of COP 26. That’s the entire basis on which we are taking things forward. It really shouldn’t be a party-political spat,” he said., Other sources said that the Foreign Office had considered using the science centre last year but failed to book it in time. The event is expected to be the largest gathering of foreign leaders, diplomats and dignitaries ever hosted by the UK, dwarfing previous global summits.

As with many species, they are now unsure how many are left., The species is considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it is not listed as threatened in Australia because it has not been formally assessed., In the absence of the monitoring or funding that can come with a national threatened species listing, Lintermans, a freshwater scientist at the University of Canberra, and the NSW Department of Primary Industries organised a rescue mission on 15 January., He says it was unclear at the time if fire had affected the species, but a forecast downpour would have., “Fish will survive the initial fire pretty well, but what they can’t survive is rain that washes ash into the water and turns it into liquid Vegemite,” Lintermans says. “It smothers the fish, smothers their gills, smothers their food source and smothers their breeding habitat.”, The effect of the ash is compounded by dead leaves washing into waterways. As organic matter decomposes it draws oxygen from the water, potentially triggering mass fish kills. Ash and decomposing material have contributed to the death of thousands of native fish at more than 20 different locations across the Murray-Darling Basin and in coastal areas of NSW over the past fortnight., At Tantangara Creek, Lintermans’ team used a technique known as backpack electro-fishing. The scientists introduce a direct current into the stream, stunning the fish enough to cause them to stop swimming, roll over and expose their light-coloured underbellies, making them simple to catch with a small net. Once free from the current in a water-filled bucket they usually recover within seconds., The trip to Tantangara was a success. Lintermans led the rescue of 142 stocky galaxias and transferred them to a temperature-controlled hatchery. He would have preferred to collect 500 to give the species the best chance to ensure a genetically diverse population in captivity, but about 150 is considered enough to offer hope., A second trip last week to rescue another galaxiid species, the short-tailed galaxias, was less successful. The short-tailed variety lives near Numeralla, north-east of Cooma, in two waterways separated by a stream infested with predator trout. One population was in an area too dangerous to visit due to fire. The other was badly affected by drought, its home reduced to a series of muddy puddles. Only about 30 fish could be recovered., Lintermans fears for the future of both species. He says the stress of his scientific work is even greater than what he felt when serving as a volunteer firefighter in his youth., “If you don’t get it right, if you don’t get in soon enough, you can lose a species. I don’t want that on my head,” he says. “Some of these things I’ve been working on for 35 years so it’s part of my family, you know.”, The two galaxiids are among an unknown number of species that scientists say are yet to receive much attention in the wake of the bushfire crisis, but will need it. The federal government has been quietly praised by experts for its initial response to the wildlife emergency, including the quick release of an analysis that mapped how much of the known habitat of 331 nationally listed threatened and migratory species had burned., But experts are also concerned for species not on that list. While the plight of the koala and platypus were quickly highlighted, fish, frogs, reptiles, insects and other invertebrates have received less attention., Of 89 Australian freshwater fish species listed as globally threatened by the IUCN, only 38 are recognised under national environment laws as at risk and requiring protection. It is estimated about a quarter of freshwater fish species are yet to be described., Lintermans says the stocky galaxias clearly warrants formal protection, which would bring it some funding for monitoring and further research into its distribution and the threats it faces., “I actually nominated it to the federal government quite some time ago, it just hasn’t got out the other end of the sausage machine yet,” he says., “The neglect of the fish side of things has really put us behind the eight-ball in terms of rescuing them or monitoring them. I’ve been banging very hard against that door for five years now and haven’t made any headway.”, He says part of the reason for the slow progress has been the shift to a single operational list for threatened species, under which state lists are being reassessed at national level. Environmentalists also point to deep cuts in funding for environmental protection since the Coalition took power in 2013., Lintermans says the government is doing what it can to respond to the fires under adverse conditions, including asking leading scientists for advice on recovery strategies at roundtable events. He attended one hosted by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, last week. But he says the test will be whether the initial $50m in funding for the wildlife response is followed with what is needed in the long-term., Several scientists who attended last week’s round table say discussion focused on the need to improve monitoring of species, echoing a point earlier raised with Guardian Australia by Helene Marsh, the chair of the government’s threatened species scientific committee., David Lindenmayer, a professor at ANU’s Fenner School of Environment and Society, says there is little hope of learning anything about the impact of fires on threatened species without better data collection. “Almost everyone around the table agreed we can’t help the way we want to help unless we get the long-term monitoring in place,” he says., Lintermans stresses the focus of that work needs to be broader than just mammals, birds and plants, as important as they are. “The real critical bit is whether enough funding is going to go to species that need long-term help,” he says. “Are we going to just get distracted again by the charismatic species?”freshwater hell scientists race save endangered fish  bushfire ash stocky galaxias", "label": 0}, "train-212": {"text": "\nSign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories\n, Get the most important environment stories, debate and analysis delivered to your inbox each week, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 11.17 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 19 Oct 2015 11.50 EDT\n\n, Sign up below to receive Green Light every week, It can be hard to keep track of all the latest developments from around the planet.

That’s why Glasgow is extremely important,” said Attenborough. “It is up to us to organise the nations of the world to do something about it. That it is why it is so encouraging to know that the present government has devoted this year to it. It’s a huge encouragement to those of us who have been worrying about this problem for a very long time to know that now this government is going to do something about it.”, The UK will host this year’s crunch UN talks on the climate crisis, known as COP 26, scheduled for Glasgow this November. But the launch of the government’s strategy got off to a troubled start, as the intended president of the talks, the former energy minister Claire O’Neill, was abruptly sacked late on Friday., For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC., The UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions., The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations., Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority., Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent, That leaves a vacuum that will not be filled, perhaps for as long as a fortnight, as the appointment depends on a wider cabinet reshuffle. Former prime minister David Cameron was approached but declined the role. Possible other candidates are understood to include Michael Gove, a serving cabinet minister, and the former Tory party leaders William Hague and Michael Howard, both now in the Lords., O’Neill made a damaging intervention with a swingeing attack on the prime minister on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday morning, just before the launch. She accused Johnson of not understanding the climate emergency, of a lack of commitment and of being untrustworthy., Whitehall sources have been briefing that O’Neill had rows with her staff and gave contradictory opinions on the COP 26 talks when meeting other governments., O’Neill rebuffed these accusations in a letter to Johnson, saying: “No 10 is rumoured to be behind the media briefings put out to support your decision, which variously contained awful, false and distorted defamatory allegations. To take two examples: ‘bullying allegations’ were referred to, when you are aware that there was a single historical complaint, which was fully investigated by the Cabinet Office and found to be entirely without merit. Equally, reports of ‘problems on international engagements’ stemmed from a single blogpost which I believe can be completely rebutted by the emails.”, High-ranking officials and people familiar with O’Neill’s work as COP 26 president in the few months since her appointment have said her performance has been mixed, with some criticising her for falling out with senior officials. Others have said she made a good impression on other governments at key meetings., Time is now running out, several people familiar with the talks warned. “We are certainly far behind where we should be now” in getting key countries on board, said one longtime observer of the climate negotiations., The mission for COP26 is to forge a new global consensus on the climate crisis. At Paris in 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that., However, those national commitments are insufficient to meet the Paris goal, and if allowed to stand they would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. The world’s leading scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have warned that the world must drastically change direction in the next decade to have a hope of meeting the Paris goals., For that reason, this year’s talks are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency. Countries are expected to come to Glasgow with stringent new targets on emissions., Johnson’s launch of the UK’s COP 26 strategy was intended to draw a line under the O’Neill row and move forward to an all-out diplomatic strategy to forge agreement among 196 nations, some of which are reluctant to come up with new targets and some of which are avowed opponents of the Paris accord., However, without a replacement for O’Neill, it looks hard to persuade people that the UK has really started on what is seen as one of the biggest international challenges this year. As one prominent attendee at the launch said: “We are getting no direction. That’s what’s missing here.”boris johnson promises urgent climate action after stinging criticism", "label": 0}, "train-215": {"text": "\nTrophy hunting event to auction 'dream hunt' with Donald Trump Jr\n, Nevada convention to culminate with chance to hunt deer with ‘accomplished conservationist’ Trump Jr and son, \nPatrick Greenfield, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 06.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 06.02 EST\n\n, A week-long “dream hunt” with the US president’s son Donald Trump Jr is being auctioned at an annual trophy hunting convention in Reno, Nevada alongside expeditions to shoot elephants, bears and giraffes., The four-day event organized by Safari Club International (SCI) and advertised as a “hunters’ heaven”, will culminate on Saturday with an auction for a week-long Sitka black-tailed deer hunt in Alaska with Trump Jr, his son and a guide. At the time of writing, bidding for the yacht-based expedition stands at $10,000 (£7,685)., Other prizes include the chance to shoot an elephant on a 14-day trip in Namibia, an all-inclusive hunt package to Zimbabwe to kill buffalo, giraffe and wildebeest, and a 10-day crocodile hunting expedition in South Africa. The proceeds from the auction, which campaigners say could exceed $5m, will fund SCI’s “hunter advocacy and wildlife conservation efforts”, according to the organization., Thousands of hunters from around the world are expected to attend the convention which begins on Wednesday, where Trump Jr, an avid trophy hunter, is set to give a keynote address., The description of the auction prize states: “This year we will be featuring Donald Trump Jr, a man who needs no introduction, and whose passion for the outdoors makes him the number one ambassador for our way of life., “Don Jr shares this heritage with his son and believes in handing down these lessons to young hunters. Don Jr and his son will be hosting this year’s hunt along with Keegan the guide in Alaska.”, It comes just weeks after ProPublica revealed Trump Jr killed a rare species of endangered sheep during a hunting trip to Mongolia last summer., Last week, anti-hunting campaigners condemned the annual SCI convention, and Brian Wilson and Al Jardine backed a boycott of their former band the Beach Boys, who are scheduled to appear at the event., Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said: “This annual event is the largest meeting in the world of people who celebrate the senseless killing, buying and selling of dead animals for bragging rights., “As our planet suffers an extinction crisis, it is business as usual for the trophy hunting industry and SCI, who continue to revel in spending millions of dollars every year to destroy imperiled wildlife.”, SCI hit back at the criticisms and called them the “height of hypocrisy”, arguing that hunting makes enormous contributions to conservation and described Trump Jr as “an accomplished conservationist”., The regulations around importing hunting trophies has been loosened under Donald Trump, though he has previously described the practice as a “horror show” despite his sons’ affection for big-game hunting. In 2018 the administration moved to make it easier to import trophies from exotic big-game animals such as elephants and lions., Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresdonald trump jr trophy hunting auction nevada aoe", "label": 0}, "train-216": {"text": "\nFireflies under threat from habitat loss, pesticides and light pollution\n, There are over 2,000 species of the beloved insects but experts say: ‘If people want fireflies in the future we need to look at this’, \nOliver Milman in New York, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 05.00 EST\n\n, The dance of lights emanating from fireflies is among the most spectacular nocturnal sights in the natural world but experts have warned certain species may be at risk of extinction., Amid a range of threats, an academic survey of firefly experts from around the world found that habitat loss is considered the heaviest pressure on the insects, which include more than 2,000 species. Pesticide spraying and the use of artificial lights at night are the other leading threats to the creatures, which are in the beetle family., Most firefly species aren’t well documented in terms of populations, with substantial data only existing for a few, such as the common European glowworm and a separate species found in Malaysia. But these records have shown declines, raising concerns that fireflies could be facing the sort of woes that have sparked fears elsewhere of a broader crisis in the insect world., “If people want fireflies around in the future we need to look at this seriously,” said Sara Lewis, a professor of biology at Tufts University in Massachusetts, who led the survey. “Fireflies are incredibly attractive insects, perhaps the most beloved of all insects, because they are so conspicuous, so magical., “They spark wonder in people. When you are in your back yard or park you notice them and are amazed. They are one of the few things that universally give people a feeling of falling in love in nature.”, Lewis is leading a team of biologists associated with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature seeking to better understand the challenges faced by fireflies and help safeguard them. “We want to keep fireflies lighting up our nights for a long, long time,” said Sonny Wong of the Malaysian Nature Society, a member of the group., Some fireflies are habitat generalists but others are at particular risk if areas are razed for residential or commercial development. Lewis said the Bethany Beach firefly, found only in a handful of wetlands along Delaware’s Atlantic coast, is an example of a firefly in such peril. “Unfortunately people also like to live on the coast and there’s been tremendous residential development there,” she said., Juvenile fireflies develop underground or in leaf litter, making them vulnerable to insecticides used to target crop pests. Fireflies have also suffered from the explosion in light pollution over the past century, a problem that scientists have warned is driving the decline of other insects, especially moths., On top of their incandescent beauty, fireflies are considered important in the ecosystem, preying upon creatures such as slugs and snails., “They also play a role as a flagship species for insect conservation, because they are so attractive,” said Lewis. “People, certainly in the US, who don’t like insects would say, ‘I love fireflies and I’ll do anything to conserve them.’ We want a world where they are still around. At least with light pollution there’s an easy way to reverse things – you just turn off the lights.”fireflies under threat habitat loss pesticides light pollution", "label": 0}, "train-217": {"text": "\nInto the Wild: buy a sustainable print and support the World Land Trust\n, Into the Wild: buy a sustainable print and support the World Land Trust, Following their sell-out show which opened to rave-reviews; Into the Wild, the debut exhibition from the innovative and cutting edge illustration agency; Roar, is now coming to a close at theprintspace gallery.

O’Neill said the cabinet sub-committee on the climate conference had not met since it formed in October., She also described problems with the choice of Glasgow as the host city, with spiralling costs and disputes between the UK and Scottish governments., “The playground politics – the yah boo politics – has got to stop,” she said., On the prime minister personally, she said: “My advice to anybody to whom Boris is making promises – whether it is voters, world leaders, ministers, employees or indeed, to family members – is to get it in writing, get a lawyer to look at it and make sure the money is in the bank.”, In her letter to Johnson, O’Neill suggested his personal animosity towards Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, was endangering the success of the summit and claimed the prime minister was considering relocating the event to an English location because of “ballooning costs”., Her comments will embarrass the prime minister on the day he holds a reception to launch COP 26 with the broadcaster David Attenborough., In his speech on Tuesday, Johnson will outline new measures including a ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles being brought forward to 2035., He will also urge other countries to follow the UK’s lead in setting targets to cut their emissions to net zero, with major cuts to greenhouse gases and any remaining pollution being offset by measures such as planting trees., Addressing O’Neill’s criticisms, Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, defended the government, saying it was setting ambitious goals and urging other countries to follow its lead., He told BBC Radio 5 live that Johnson did get climate change., “I’ve known the PM for more than 30 years and the first time I met him he told me he was a green Tory,” he said., Johnson wants to use COP 26 to showcase the UK’s advances in renewable energy, clean technology and electric vehicles, and the power of the City of London as a global financial centre to pour billions into the switch to a low-carbon economy., The UK is one of the first countries to pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. However, activists have said the government lacks a clear plan for reaching net zero, and few new measures have been announced since the target was enshrined in law by Theresa May last summer., Johnson will face an uphill task in persuading countries such as China, India and the US to renew their emissions-cutting pledges under the 2015 Paris agreement., The last UN climate talks ended in December amid fractious scenes and a failure to compromise on key issues. Several countries seem determined to block progress, including Brazil and Saudi Arabia. The US, under Donald Trump, is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris agreement, a move that will take legal effect days before COP 26 starts, and the day after the US presidential election., Johnson also suffered a major mis-step and accusations of hypocrisy at the recent UK-Africa summit, where he pledged to stop UK investment in coal in Africa. There has been no such investment by the UK since 2002, but at the summit deals were signed for nearly £2bn investment in African oil and gas.sacked cop 26 chair claire oneill berates boris johnson over climate record", "label": 0}, "train-219": {"text": "\nGlobal heating a serious threat to the world's climate refuges, study finds\n, Biodiversity hotspots with millions of years of climate stability could be among the world’s hardest hit regions , \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 02.43 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 02.45 EST\n\n, Biodiversity hotspots that have given species a safe haven from changing climates for millions of years will come under threat from human-driven global heating, a new study has found., Species that have evolved in tropical regions such Australia’s wet tropics, the Guinean forests of Western Africa and the Andes Mountains will come under increasing stress as the planet warms, the study finds., Experts reacted to the study with shock, saying it was depressing that some of the Earth’s “most critical real-estate for saving nature” could be under threat., Published in the journal Nature Climate Change, the study modelled global land and ocean temperatures and rainfall for the past 21,000 years., The study then examined the impact of adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere under two scenarios – one considered to represent very high emissions and another with much lower levels of emissions., Places that are rich in biodiversity tend to overlap with places in the tropics that have experienced relatively stable climates in the past, providing a refuge for species when other regions have warmed, the paper explains., Assoc Prof Damien Fordham, a global change ecologist at the University of Adelaide and a co-author of the research, told Guardian Australia this had allowed ancient species to survive, causing a “stacking” of biodiversity., He said: “We had hoped that what we would find was that these places would continue to have stable climates. But what’s extremely worrying is that we see a shift from stable to unstable.”, He said while the study looked closely at the past 21,000 years, the areas impacted were known to have supported stable climates for millions of years., Fordham said species in these areas tended to be adapted to survive within very narrow temperature and climate boundaries. But human-caused climate change would happen too fast for species to evolve or move, so even small shifts would have large impacts., “Here we see really strong direct evidence of how climate change could have really adverse affects in the tropics that harbour the highest places for biodiversity on the planet.”, He said the higher and lower emissions scenarios used to project changes to the end of this century showed similar impacts., He added: “We see this as a further reason for action on climate change, and also in considering these hotspots in our plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation.”, Global expert on conservation management Prof Hugh Possingham, of the University of Queensland and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, said the study was “depressing”., He said there had been a common assumption that places that had acted as “climate refugia” of the past would carry out the same function in the future., He told Guardian Australia: “If this is true, and they do provide compelling arguments, it is more bad news for nature., “What I would like to see is some work on picking landscape scale actions that could ameliorate these predicted effects., “What actions could we conceivably take that would facilitate climate adaptation at these critical locations?

The EU is the biggest bloc on the brink of signing up to net zero, but major economies including China, the US and India show little sign of doing so., As part of the push, the prime minister is bringing forward a target to phase out diesel and petrol vehicles by 2035, instead of 2040 as at present. The ban will include hybrid vehicles for the first time., Johnson’s call to other countries came as he launched the UK’s plans to host crunch UN climate talks in Glasgow this November. The talks, known as COP 26, are aimed at putting the world on track to fulfil the Paris agreement of 2015, as current emissions pledges are inadequate to stave off dangerous levels of global heating., The launch got off to a rocky start, however, as last Friday evening the former energy minister charged with leading the UK’s presidency, Claire O’Neill, was abruptly sacked. She was said to have provoked rows with officials, to have issued confusing messages to other countries, and to have lacked the diplomatic skills and experience to inspire confidence in foreign capitals., But her sacking led to consternation among observers, who feared the UK was losing its grip on the process., The UK will face a massive diplomatic challenge to make COP 26 a success, as the last round of talks ended in disarray and recriminations last December in Madrid: countries failed to agree on key agenda items, with only a partial resolve to come back with stronger emissions-cutting targets this year in Glasgow., No replacement for O’Neill has yet been officially announced. The former prime minister David Cameron has been approached but has turned down the role. Other candidates including Michael Gove and former Conservative leaders William Hague and Michael Howard have been mentioned as possibles. Getting a strong leader in place is widely viewed as vital to demonstrating the UK’s seriousness of intent., “Hosting COP 26 is an important opportunity for the UK and nations across the globe to step up in the fight against climate change,” Johnson told dignitaries, businesses and campaigners. “As we set out our plans to hit our ambitious 2050 net zero target across this year, so we shall urge others to join us in pledging net zero emissions. 2020 must be the year we turn the tide on global warming – it will be the year when we choose a cleaner, greener future for all.”, As part of the COP 26 push, the prime minister also highlighted the £2bn that the government has agreed to spend on meeting the net zero target, including up to £1bn to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles, £222m for research into nuclear fusion, and £26m for carbon capture technology., Edmund King, president of the AA, said the new target on car sales was incredibly challenging and asked whether there would be a proper supply of zero emissions vehicles in less than fifteen years., “We will also need a package of grants coupled with a comprehensive charging infrastructure at homes and in towns, cities, motorways and rural locations,” he said, adding concern about the ban on hybrids., Alasdair Roxburgh, of Friends of the Earth, said ministerial promises were no longer enough, however. Campaigners are frustrated that although Theresa May’s government agreed the net zero target last summer, little in the way of concrete measures have been brought forward since then, which they have said sets a poor example for inspiring action in other countries at COP 26., “If the government is honest about the scale and urgency of the problem then we won’t hear about plans and pledges any more, we will hear about definite actions being immediately taken,” said Roxburgh. “What the UK must do is drastically cut emissions in the lifetime of this parliament. With the bushfires raging in Australia and deadly flooding in Indonesia, the climate crisis is already claiming lives, destroying homes and wildlife. But we can stave off the worst impacts of climate breakdown, if we act together now, and the UK government have the opportunity to set the bar high.”, A key aim for COP 26 is for rich countries to provide the necessary finance to the developing world to cut carbon in poor nations. But discussions on climate finance ran aground at last year’s conference, and little progress has been made on the issue in the four years since the Paris agreement was signed., “One strong and important thing that the UK government can do is provide funding for poorer countries, most affected by climate change, yet least responsible for it,” said Roxburgh.pm urges major economies to go carbon neutral by 2050", "label": 0}, "train-222": {"text": "'Invisible killer': UK government urged to tackle air pollution, British Heart Foundation says 15m Britons are exposed to toxic levels of pollution, Almost a quarter of people in the UK are being exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution with potentially devastating health consequences, according to analysis., The study by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) found that about 15 million people in the UK live in areas where average levels of PM2.5 – a tiny toxic particle that predominantly comes from vehicle emissions, wood burning and construction – exceeds guidelines set by the World Health Foundation., Jacob West of the BHF said the scale of the problem meant the government, with its environment bill having returned to parliament last week, should make tackling air pollution in towns and cities across the country a priority., “Tackling a public health emergency on this scale requires serious and sustained commitment,” he said. “The uncomfortable truth is that UK heart and circulatory deaths attributed to air pollution could exceed 160,000 over the next decade unless we take radical steps now.”, He said previous governments had taken bold steps such as introducing a Clean Air Act or, more recently, banning smoking to improve air quality, and called on Boris Johnson’s administration to do something similar., “This government has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take brave political action in cleaning up our toxic air,” he said., Exposure to PM2.5 has serious health implications, especially for children, increasing the likelihood of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Health experts say young people exposed to these toxic pollutants are more likely to grow up with reduced lung function and develop asthma., Other scientific studies have highlighted the long-term damage air pollution is doing to people’s health, from being linked to dementia to harming unborn babies and increasing the risk of cancer., While PM2.5 particles come predominantly from traffic fumes, wood-burning stoves and construction, they can also come from other industrial and agricultural sources., West said: “We can’t see them, but every day, we all breathe in tiny toxic particles which damage our heart and circulatory health. They are an invisible killer.”, The previous Conservative government’s clean air strategy was published in January 2019 but has been widely criticised by campaigners for not being bold enough., West said: “We must not become complacent and accept that dirty air is a part of normal life. Politicians have a unique opportunity to limit the damaging effects of pollution and improve the quality of our air, and they must seize it.” He said everyone had a role to play in demanding a healthier environment. “We are urging people to write to their MP to demand a change to the law.

But the Met Office got its forecast right to the minute, even when the front had been over the Atlantic., At 11 sharp, down came horizontal rain on freezing westerlies, but it wasn’t my miserable situation that troubled me. It was the thought that the same godforsaken conditions were once a daily reality for local workers. Because in the 18th century, come rain or sleet, Buxton miners had to trudge out to this bleak spot to make ends meet. For labouring 12 hours a day, six days a week, they received the princely sum of £32 per annum., To the east of me are the head of the Goyt Valley and Axe Edge. Now they look nothing more than dreary mist-shrouded moorland, but there were once 238 mine shafts here, dug over two centuries, to reach seams of low-quality coal., The miners worked with pick and shovel, bent-backed for lack of height in the tunnel, and lit only by oil- or candlelight. Yet spare a thought, too, for those working the winch at the shaft-head to raise the coal in wicker baskets or corves. Each corf held a hundredweight (50.8kg) and a score (20) of them weighed a ton. In their exemplary local history, The Coal Mines of Buxton (1985), Alan Roberts and John Leach describe how in 1790 one pair hauled up 200 score of coal in a fortnight – a load every two minutes over the whole 144 hours., Many of the miners in the 1790 census had surnames – Ashmore, Bagshaw, Brindley, Mellor, Nadin, Salt – that you would find in any modern Buxton directory. I wonder what those same men might have said had you told them that the stuff they dug was made of sunlight 330m years ago; that their work would set us all on a path whereby humanity itself helps make the weather; that can, in turn, set fire to parts of Australia almost equal to the whole British landmass., • This article was amended on 6 February 2020 to offer the exact metric conversion of a hundredweight (50.8kg) and clarify that 20 hundredweights make up one imperial ton, not “almost a metric tonne”.country diary a bleak mining history springs to mind", "label": 0}, "train-224": {"text": "\nIndigenous envoy challenges Siemens in Germany over Adani mine\n, Indigenous representative will tell Siemens it is wrong to say traditional owners support Adani’s Carmichael mine, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 22.37 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 23.03 EST\n\n, An envoy from an Australian Indigenous group has travelled to Germany to push for a meeting with the head of technology giant Siemens, claiming the company failed to properly check that traditional owners supported Adani’s controversial Carmichael coal project in Queensland., The Wangan and Jagalingou Family Council, which has spent years challenging the Adani mine, says the company was wrong to claim the project had been approved by its people., W&amp;J council representative Murrawah Johnson, who is in Germany, has asked to meet Siemens’ chief executive, Joe Kaeser, and will attend the company’s AGM in Munich on Wednesday., The company is standing by its earlier statements about Indigenous support for the project, telling Guardian Australia on Tuesday that it had taken its position from the “prescribed legal process in Australia”., Also on Tuesday, 19 health groups advocating action on climate change from countries including Australia, the UK, US and India, published an open letter to Siemens, asking the company to “end its association with Adani and its climate-wrecking coalmine”., In January, Siemens said it had reviewed its reported $30m contract to provide signalling technology to the mine’s railway, and that it would complete the work., Kaeser said the Carmichael project was “approved” by the W&amp;J people which, he said, was “very important to us”., Johnson said: “It is ridiculous that Siemens could say that W&amp;J people support this mine. We’ve had three meetings that have all said no.”, Construction has started on the mine, from which coal will be taken by rail to the company’s Abbot Point port for export to coal power stations. The mine is one of the most contentious resource projects in Australian history., The project has also caused rifts between Indigenous people. Some support the mine, while others, including W&amp;J council leader Adrian Burragubba, are strongly opposed., Speaking to Guardian Australia from Munich, Johnson said “free, prior and informed consent” – a cornerstone of negotiations between First Nations peoples and project developers – did not exist for the Adani mine., She accused Siemens of relying on “talking points” from the mine’s supporters, incuding former resources minister Matt Canavan, the Queensland government and Adani itself, rather than hearing directly from traditional owners., The outcome of one April 2016 meeting that voted strongly in favour of an Indigenous Land Use Agreement has been consistently used by Adani supporters. But Johnson and others describe that vote as a “sham”, claiming it had been boycotted by some W&amp;J people. , The W&amp;J council was established in 2014 as a “self-determined” representative group of 12 family lines, partly out of frustration with the native title process and to advocate against the Adani mine., In 2019 the state government extinguished native title over Wangan and Jagalingou country to enable the Adani project to proceed., The W&amp;J council has written to Siemens and provided legal advice it commissioned from the US-based environmental law group Earthjustice., The letter says: “Contrary to statements by the Adani corporation and members of the Australian government, we have never given our free, prior and informed consent to the extinguishment of our rights, or the development of the Carmichael mine on our traditional lands – a development that would destroy large parts of our ancestral homelands to which our law and culture are deeply connected.”, Siemens has said it is one of the first major companies to have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030., In a statement the company said: “Siemens’ comment regarding the support of the W&amp;J people refers to the prescribed legal process in Australia regarding Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs)., “This includes the fact that an Indigenous Land Use Agreement was registered in the National Native Title Tribunal and that the vast majority of the W&amp;J people decided in favour of the Indigenous Land Use Agreement with a vote of 294 to 1. All on public record. Also, further assessment and the ruling of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia., “It’s important to note that in addition to the W&amp;J ILUA, there are other ILUAs covering the project area with three different indigenous groups. These were signed some time ago with the Jangga People, the Birriah People and the Juru People., “The Siemens signalling equipment for the rail line is designed for safe and efficient operation of trains: trains being delivered by another company on a rail line being built by another company, for a project that was legally and environmentally approved several months ago, where extensive works began several months ago and where over $700 million of contracts have already been awarded.”indigenous envoy challenges siemens in germany over adani mine", "label": 0}, "train-225": {"text": "\nPM under pressure to appoint COP 26 head as Gove tipped for job\n, Experts warn ongoing vacancy is damaging the UN climate summit’s prospects of success, \nFiona Harvey and \nRowena Mason, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 14.04 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 15.20 EST\n\n, Boris Johnson is under increasing pressure to appoint a new president of the UN climate summit, with Michael Gove emerging as the most hotly tipped choice in Westminster, as experts warned the continuing power vacuum was damaging the prospect of success at the talks., Gove has a strong reputation among environmental campaigners, having impressed them with his energy as environment secretary under Theresa May, when he drew up a 25-year environment plan and new environment and agriculture bills., Another potential candidate is Michael Howard, the former Tory leader and ex-environment secretary, who has taken a more active role in recent years defending the need for strong action on the climate., The prime minister has few choices available, as two candidates – the former prime minister David Cameron and the former Tory party leader William Hague – have ruled themselves out. It is thought unlikely Johnson would reach across party lines to a Labour grandee, such as Gordon Brown, or David Miliband – a former environment secretary – or across Brexit lines to remainer candidates, such as the former Tory prime minister John Major or Lord Deben a former Tory environment secretary., That leaves a narrowing field, and though a serving minister will carry governmental authority, the time commitment is likely to rule out sharing it with another major role, such as trade talks. The bookmaker Ladbrokes said it was offering 5-1 on Gove, with Zac Goldsmith – also a prominent environmentalist – ahead at 3-1, and Andrea Leadsom at 10-1., Cameron and Hague are understood to have cited other commitments and concerns over the role when they turned down approaches to take on the presidency, which was left vacant by the abrupt sacking of the former energy minister Claire O’Neill last Friday., That decision, without a replacement waiting in the wings, has left a yawning gap over several days which O’Neill has filled with bitter attacks on the government’s record, and Johnson’s character, while a further damaging row blew up over the Scottish government’s arrangements at the proposed venue in Glasgow., For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC., The UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions., The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations., Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority., Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent, Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, , the government’s statutory adviser, tweeted: “I think I speak for most friendly independent climate advisory bodies when I say I’d like to see this COP 26 business sorted out sharpish. It’s very important that the UK is brilliant in the presidency and that Scotland is brilliant as the host for this summit.”, Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “In international diplomacy, signals do matter, and the longer the position of COP 26 president remains vacant, the weaker Britain’s authority as host will look.” , Campaigners have also pointed to the lack of a clear strategy or timetable laid out by Johnson at the launch event. One COP observer said: “You have to look serious, to inspire confidence among world leaders. We aren’t seeing them look serious.”, Representatives from developing countries said the UK could still turn around the situation, but it would require swift action before the impression took hold of a government lacking control and a coherent plan., When the French government took on the COP presidency ahead of the Paris agreement in 2015, ministers had clear roles and a roster of events for the year was set out covering all aspects of a possible agreement, from climate science to green technology, and the delivery of finance for developing countries. Every ambassador and high-ranking officials in French embassies around the world were given instructions to bring up climate change at every possible meeting., At the UK launch, apart from a new logo for a “year of climate action”, there was no detail on how COP 26 would be managed. The only events mentioned, apart from the summit itself in November, were two pre-meetings for negotiators arranged by the Italian government, which has formal co-host status alongside the UK., Johnson’s attempt to take charge of the talks himself, by joining Sir David Attenborough on stage at the Science Museum launch, also appeared to backfire. The prime minister said little of substance, preferring to talk about a 19th-century pioneer of electric taxis, and the absence of a COP 26 president was made all the more obvious., Tom Burke, founder of the E3G environmental group, said: “The prime minister made a hash of launching COP 26, and has put a dent in the UK’s deserved reputation for climate leadership.”, 3-1 Zac Goldsmith, A passionate environmentalist and former owner of the Ecologist magazine, Goldsmith was appointed to the Lords with a ministerial role at the Department for International Development after losing his seat in the general election., 5-1 Michael Gove, Hotly tipped within Westminster, Gove surprised green campaigners by proving an effective and reforming environment secretary, having outed himself as a “shy green Tory”. Can bank on goodwill and respect among the climate community, and has the ministerial heft and record. Also enjoys good relations with Rupert Murdoch and was described as a “phenomenon” by Donald Trump. Gove was thought to want a greater role in the negotiations on new trade deals following Brexit, but now that David Frost has taken on more of that responsibility, Gove may be willing to consider the COP 26 role., 10-1 Andrea Leadsom, A prospect viewed with horror by climate campaigners. Leadsom is reported to have asked officials whether climate change was real when taking up her previous role as energy minister., 12-1 Gordon Brown, Took on a strong role at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, and as a Scot would relish hosting the conference in Glasgow.

That plant, a male, was named Methuselah after the oldest character in the Bible., But the new study goes further – not only involving more seeds, but shedding light on the way Judean farmers may have cultivated the famous plants., And with the newly germinated seeds including females, the discovery could bear further fruit: the team say they hope to apply Methuselah’s pollen to Hannah – which is expected to produce a flower within the next two years – with the goal of producing dates., But it may not quite be a resurrection., “It won’t be the typical Judean date, because dates that were grown at that time – just like dates that are grown today – are not grown from seeds that somebody puts in the earth,” said Dr Sarah Sallon, director of the Louis Borick Natural Medicine Research Centre at the Hadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem. “They are grown from clones from very high-producing females.”, Date palms are thought to have first been cultivated in Arabia and Mesopotamia (now Iraq) more than 6,000 years ago and were once widespread in ancient Judea, a region of the Levant. As well as being an important item of food, said Sallon, they were used to treat various medical conditions, including depression and poor memory. “Dates were an enormous export from Judea and they were famous,” she said., Writers from Pliny the Elder to Herodotus raved about the qualities of Judean dates, including their long shelf-life, which allowed them to be transported far and wide. “Herod even used to present them to the emperor in Rome every year,” said Sallon., But the plants suffered under centuries of unrest; by the 19th century the plantations had disappeared., Writing in the journal Science Advances, Sallon and colleagues report how they planted 32 Judean date palm seeds retrieved from a variety of archaeological sites across the Judean desert. These include Masada and caves at Qumran – shelters best known for concealing the Dead Sea scrolls but which were also used by refugees in ancient times., “I spent hours and hours in the archaeology department picking through the best seeds,” said Sallon. “A lot of them had holes in where insects had bored through or they had fallen apart, but some were really pristine and I picked the very best ones.”, Six of the seeds sprouted. The team radiocarbon-dated fragments of the shells left after germination to reveal that Hannah and Adam date to somewhere between the first and fourth centuries BC. Judith and Boaz were dated to a 200-year period from the mid-second century BC, and Uriel and Jonah were dated to somewhere between the first and second centuries AD., “I’m Jewish, so I gave them Jewish names,” said Sallon, adding that, before the sex of the plants was known from genetic analysis, Adam was named Eve. , While some seeds took just weeks to sprout, others took half a year. “We were beginning to despair and then suddenly they came up,” she said., The team found that ancient date seeds are larger than those of both modern cultivated date palms and wild plants. “Today’s seeds are still about 30% smaller than what they grew in Judea 2,000 years ago,” said Sallon. , Genetic analysis revealed that the older the ancient seeds were, the more “eastern” their genetic makeup appeared to be: Adam and Methuselah are closest to present-day varieties from the Gulf., That, said Sallon, may reflect the type of trees that naturally grew in Judea at the time, or they may have been brought up the Red Sea from Arabia – an ancient trading route., Hannah and Judith are closer to modern Iraqi varieties – something Sallon said may be linked to the return of Jews from exile in Babylon in the late sixth century BC, many of whom had worked on Babylonian date plantations and may have brought plants back with them., Meanwhile, Uriel, Boaz and Jonah had a high genetic contribution from varieties west of Egypt and were most genetically similar to modern varieties from Morocco. “The Roman occupation of Judea was from the first century and it is possible that at that time they were bringing date varieties in from north Africa,” said Sallon.scientists in israel grow date plants from 2000 year old seeds", "label": 0}, "train-227": {"text": "\nPut Caroline Lucas in charge of COP 26\n, Letters, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 13.06 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 26 Mar 2020 07.45 EDT\n\n, Following the sacking of Claire O’Neill as president of the forthcoming climate change talks in Glasgow, and her subsequent criticism of Boris Johnson (COP 26: Cameron was asked by PM to take over – but he said no, 5 February), I would suggest that the only UK politician of sufficient integrity, dedication and expert knowledge on the subject of climate change to take over is Caroline Lucas MP.Rose HarvieDumbarton, • I wonder what the government will do to replace the huge tax receipts lost when petrol and diesel vehicles are banned.

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has suggested he may introduce national standards that would report on how much hazard reduction the states carried out each year., Speaking in parliament on Wednesday, Morrison said hazard reduction was at least as important as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to protect people as fire seasons worsened., The University of Melbourne desktop analysis used Rural Fire Service data to compare the size and severity of this season’s bushfires area with hazard reduction burns over the past five years. The majority of the area in which there had been prescribed burning had been razed again by bushfire in the past three months., Patrick Baker, a professor of silviculture and forest ecology, said the prescribed burning did not “seem to have done much at all” in areas that faced a crowning bushfire that burned the canopy., He said the fire that devastated the NSW south coast between Batemans Bay and Jervis Bay over the new year scored 3.95 out of 4 on a severity scale despite recent hazard reduction burns in the area, some of which scored up to 3.8. “Pretty much the whole area was torched,” Baker said., The analysis found prescribed burning was likely to have helped save property in areas on the fringe of major fire complexes where the flames were less severe, such as Katoomba in the Blue Mountains., Baker said it suggested prescribed burning was most effective when used as part of a risk-based system designed to help protect chosen assets – human life, biodiversity, property and water catchments – rather than based on an arbitrary numeric target. He said a 5% annual target risked leading to swathes of remote landscape being burned without significantly reducing the risk to assets., In Victoria, for example, burning the sandy soiled landscape in the Mallee, which makes up nearly a fifth of the state, would do little to protect assets but could have a catastrophic impact on native animals and plants, he said., “We need to be smart about where we burn,” Baker said. “The other issue is we don’t have endless resources to do this. It’s extraordinarily expensive, so if people want to double or triple or quadruple prescribed burning, the question is what else are we not going to get done?”, Morrison announced on Tuesday that former a defence chief, Mark Binskin, would lead a royal commission into the bushfire crisis, which has claimed 33 lives, destroyed thousands of homes and is estimated to have killed more than 1bn animals., Scientists and former emergency service chiefs say the climate crisis has exacerbated fire risk and reduced the window each year in which hazard reduction burning can be safely carried out. They say the increased threat demands both greater resources to fight fires and urgent action to cut emissions., A group of 31 ex-fire and emergency bosses will write to Morrison on Thursday saying the royal commission will be a waste of time and money if it does not examine the role of climate change., In a statement released on Wednesday night, Greg Mullins, the former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, said: “Climate change has increased fire danger so much that fires now burn freely through areas that have undergone hazard reduction burning recently. I saw fires a metre high burning across mown lawns while fighting fires at Batemans Bay on New Year’s Eve.”, The current Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, told the ABC on Wednesday that, while some objected to the description, the ongoing fire crisis was clearly unprecedented. He said no fire season had taken as many lives, destroyed as many homes and burned through a quarter of the state’s forested country across the Great Dividing Range. “The reality is it has been an extraordinary, difficult, damaging, destructive, fatal and tragic fire season, and it is without precedent,” he said., The 5% annual hazard reduction target was recommended by the royal commission into the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, which killed 173 people. Neil Comrie, a former Victoria police chief commissioner who was appointed to oversee implementation of the royal commission’s recommendations, later found the target was likely to not be achievable, affordable or sustainable, and the primary focus should be protection of lives and communities., The Victorian Andrews government dropped the 5% goal and adopted a risk-based approach in 2016, pledging to focus on reducing fuel loads close to communities and in remote back-country areas where fires can start, grow and build in intensity., John Thwaites, a former Victorian deputy premier and environment minister and now the chairman of Monash Sustainable Development Institute, said despite claims the states were not doing enough, fuel reduction had risen 61% in Victoria in the decade following the Black Saturday fires compared with the previous 10 years., Even with that increase, the state met its increased hazard reduction targets only twice before moving to the risk-based system three years ago. It planned to burn 246,000 hectares in 2019, but managed little more than half that because it was not safe to burn, officials said., In NSW, both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Rural Fire Service met hectare-based targets for fuel reduction last year, but the rural service fell short of a goal of limiting fire hazards around 113,130 properties., Thwaites said higher temperatures, drier fuel and stronger winds were increasingly making it unsafe to burn in autumn and spring, but a risk-based approach using sophisticated modelling such as that being adopted in Victoria would reduce the likelihood that homes were lost.hazard reduction burning had little to no effect in slowing this summers bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-229": {"text": "\nJeremy Corbyn: PM is 'failing spectacularly' on climate crisis\n, Labour leader criticises COP 26 preparations and Johnson’s record on environment, \nRowena Mason Deputy political editor, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 08.38 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 09.10 EST\n\n, Jeremy Corbyn has accused Boris Johnson of “failing spectacularly” to measure up to the scale of the climate crisis, after the sacked president of COP 26 revealed the UK was miles behind in getting ready for the November summit., Speaking at prime minister’s questions, Corbyn raised the government’s failure to organise COP 26 properly, after Johnson’s team sacked Claire O’Neill as the summit’s president just days before its formal launch., Corbyn highlighted O’Neill’s criticisms that “there has been a huge lack of leadership and engagement from this government” over the climate crisis conference., But Johnson dismissed the attack, saying all that Corbyn would produce on tackling global heating was “a load of hot air”., “If you look at what this government is achieving and already has achieved on climate change, it is quite phenomenal,” Johnson claimed., The international COP 26 summit is due to take place in November in Glasgow but is without a leader after David Cameron and William Hague both turned down the vacant role of president., Corbyn noted that two former Conservative leaders had turned down the job, joking that “maybe it could be third time lucky”, as he suggested Sir Iain Duncan Smith for the role., Labour said its suggestion would be for Ed Miliband, the former energy secretary and ex-Labour leader, to take over the presidency as he had the experience., Corbyn’s spokesman said: “Ed Miliband is certainly someone who has a strong record and an entirely suitable person. The issue is not exactly who should take on the role but someone with credibility.”, The Labour leader went on to criticise Johnson’s record on climate change, highlighting the comments from the prime minister that were sceptical of climate science until as recently as four years ago., “Considering his monumental failure in advance of COP 26, isn’t it really just a continuation of his climate change denial statements that he was regularly making up until 2015?” Corbyn said., Johnson said Corbyn was “talking absolute nonsense” and defended the government’s agenda, saying: “We lead the world in going for a zero-carbon approach. His own approach is utterly unclear and has been condemned by the GMB as a disaster for the UK economy., “He would confiscate people’s cars and prevent them from having foreign holidays.”, Corbyn countered that the prime minister had a “very vivid imagination”, adding: “Unfortunately, his vivid imagination seems to have taken over from his memory because he might recall saying that climate change is a primitive fear without foundation.”jeremy corbyn boris johnson failing spectacularly on climate crisis", "label": 0}, "train-230": {"text": "\nDavid Cameron turns down offer of COP 26 climate summit job\n, Ex-PM rejects Boris Johnson’s offer saying he already has ‘a lot of things’ to do this year, \nAlexandra Topping and agencies, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 02.41 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 05.46 EST\n\n, David Cameron has turned down an offer from Boris Johnson to head the UK’s preparations for a crucial international climate summit in Glasgow, saying he already has “a lot of things” to do this year., The former prime minister was asked by Johnson to be the president of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) but Cameron rejected the offer., Cameron said: “There are a lot of things I have already agreed to do this year, not least the work I do for Alzheimer’s Research UK, so I thought it was important that I carried on with that work.”, He called the climate change conference “absolutely vital”, adding that he wished the government well., “I’m sure that there will be a government minister, or someone, who will be able to do the job and do it very well. The government has my backing as they go forward.”, Asked about his relationship with Johnson, Cameron declined to answer. , Lord Barker of Battle, who served as an energy and climate change minister under Cameron and is a close friend and ally of the former prime minister, told BBC Two’s Newsnight on Tuesday that he understood Cameron felt “it was just a little too soon for him personally to come back into a frontline political role”., The former Conservative leader William Hague was also reported to have been offered it and to have also declined., On Tuesday during the conference’s launch event, Johnson refused to answer questions about who would take on the job., The former clean growth minister Claire O’Neill, who stood down as a Tory MP at the general election, was sacked on Friday as president of the talks by the prime minister’s special adviser, Dominic Cummings.

So too, perhaps, by the white canons of the Premonstratensian order who occupied this abbey until its dissolution by Henry VIII. The sights and sounds we witnessed here this evening might have seemed to them to signal the onset of the apocalypse., Roosts of jackdaws suddenly erupted from crowns of trees in the valley of the River Tees, then coalesced into a vast flock of more than 100, circling the abbey in a swirling danse macabre. It’s hard to avoid anthropomorphism when these innately sociable birds take to the air like this, often at the end of blustery winter afternoons. It seems like a collective expression of their sheer enjoyment of flight. Earthbound, we watched as they soared on updraughts and rode turbulence that swirled around the walls of the ruins., The call of a jackdaw is a staccato, metallic “chack”, sharp as a hammer blow on an anvil. The cacophony from so many, falling on to grass still frosted with ice crystals, seemed to chime with our exhilaration at the end of a long walk on a starkly beautiful January day., As the sun dipped below the western horizon, the riotous display rose higher until, as suddenly as it had all begun, small groups broke away and settled back into trees that were already submerged in shadow. Monastic silence returned., Jackdaws may have been residents of this abbey since its foundation 800 years ago. Some nest in stone sockets that once supported the chapel roof beams, high on a south-facing wall, sheltered from north-easterly winds. It’s hard to imagine more desirable, secure nest boxes for the untidy heap of sticks that constitutes a jackdaw’s nest, lined with sheep wool plucked from a flock that grazes just a field away., Jackdaws mate for life. While we watched, a returning female landed beside her nest on the chapel parapet, crouching low, with trembling wings and tail feathers, to elicit a food gift; such behaviour, reinforcing the pair bond, seemed to herald the start of their new breeding season.country diary jackdaws break the monastic silence", "label": 0}, "train-232": {"text": "\nTrump finalizes plans to open Utah monuments for mining and drilling\n, Lawsuits are pending from groups who have challenged the constitutionality of shrinking Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, Guardian staff and agencies, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 17.10 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2020 05.44 EST\n\n, Plans finalized on Thursday for two national monuments in Utah downsized by Donald Trump would ensure that lands previously off-limits to energy development will be open to mining and drilling. The move comes despite pending lawsuits from conservation, tribal and paleontology groups, who have challenged the constitutionality of the president’s action. The Trump administration slashed the size of Bears Ears national monument by 85% and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument by nearly half in December 2017, in what represented the largest elimination of public lands protections in US history. , Conservation groups criticized the Trump administration on Thursday for spending time on management plans they believe will become moot when the court sides with their assertion that Trump misused the Antiquities Act to reverse decisions by previous presidents., “It’s the height of arrogance for Trump to rush through final decisions on what’s left of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante while we’re fighting his illegal evisceration of these national monuments in court,” said Randi Spivak, public lands director at the Center for Biological Diversity in a statement. “Trump is eroding vital protections for these spectacular landscapes. We won’t rest until all of these public lands are safeguarded for future generations.”, Bill Clinton created the Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument in 1996 on land that showcases cliffs, canyons, waterfalls and arches in southern Utah. Barack Obama created Bears Ears national monument in 2016 on a scenic swath of southern Utah with red rock plateaus, cliffs and canyons on land considered sacred to tribes., A joint statement released by Native American tribal nations and conservation groups behind the court cases challenging Trump’s downsizing said the monuments are hotbeds of paleontological research, as well as archeological, cultural and natural resources., Sarah Bauman, the executive director of the Grand Staircase Escalante Partners, said the monument was an essential site for research into the climate crisis. “As a result of its physical isolation and areas of minimal human impact, as well as its enormous ecological diversity, it provides mankind with rare opportunities for unique comparative climate change studies,” she said. “Without protections, these opportunities will be lost and with them our ability to build essential knowledge and resources for mitigating climate change.”, The lands have generated little interest from energy companies in the two years since Trump cut their size, said Casey Hammond, the acting assistant secretary for land and minerals management with the US Department of the Interior., Hammond said in a conference call the department had a duty to work on the management plans after Trump signed his proclamations despite the pending lawsuits that seek to return the monuments to their original sizes., “If we stopped and waited for every piece of litigation to be resolved we would never be able to do much of anything around here,” Hammond said., Market dynamics have limited interest in a large coal reserve found in the now unprotected lands cut from Grand Staircase and uranium on lands cut from Bears Ears., But an economic analysis by the US government estimates coal production could lead to $208m in annual revenues and $16.6m in royalties on lands cut from Grand Staircase. Oil and gas wells in that area could produce $4.1m in annual revenues, the analysis says., If interest comes as energy market forces shift, Hammond said the lands cut remain under federal control and governed by “time-tested laws” and subject to environmental regulations. He rebuffed the oft-repeated claim from conservation groups that there would be a “free-for-all” for mineral development., “Any suggestion that these lands and resources will be adversely impacted by the mere act of being excluded from the monuments is simply not true,” Hammond said., Trump cut the size of the monuments following a review of 27 national monuments by the then interior secretary, Ryan Zinke. The move earned cheers from Republican leaders in Utah, including the former US senator Orrin Hatch, as well as many local ranchers who graze cattle on monument land. trump utah national parks energy development drilling", "label": 0}, "train-233": {"text": "\nLargest maker of pesticide linked to brain damage in kids to stop producing chemical\n, Announcement comes after Trump administration reversed plans to ban chlorpyrifos and rejected scientific conclusions of experts, \nSam Levin in Los Angeles, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 16.11 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 16.21 EST\n\n, The world’s largest manufacturer of chlorpyrifos, an agricultural pesticide linked to brain damage in children, has announced that it will stop producing the chemical by the end of the year., The announcement on Thursday by Corteva, the corporation formed from a Dow Chemical and DuPont merger, comes after the Trump administration reversed regulatory plans to ban the pesticide and rejected the scientific conclusions of US government experts., Chlorpyrifos has been widely used on corn, soybeans, almonds, citrus, cotton, grapes, walnuts and other crops, but research has repeatedly found serious health effects in children, including impaired brain  development. Environmental groups have long advocated for its ban, and the state of California, which grows the majority of the nation’s fruits and nuts, defied Trump and banned the chemical last year., Corteva said it was ending production due to declining sales. Susanne Wasson, the president of Corteva’s crop protection business, told Reuters it was a “difficult decision”., Chlorpyrifos is a neurotoxic chemical that was found to be harmful enough to humans that the US banned it from residential use in 2000. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), however, has continued to defend its safety for agricultural uses., In California’s Central Valley, the heart of the agricultural industry, researchers raised concerns about impacts on pregnant women who lived near farms that sprayed chlorpyrifos. Some studies found low to moderate levels of exposure during pregnancy were linked to memory problems and lower IQ., Marisa Ordonia, an attorney with Earthjustice, a group that has sued the EPA for failing to ban chlorpyrifos, said advocates would still seek a ban on the product given that it remains on the market through other manufacturers., “Other people are going to continue to profit from harming children,” she said, adding: “It is big that such a major player is saying no, we’re not going to do this any more. It’s a great signal that people don’t want brain-damaging pesticides on their food. But we’re going to continue to keep fighting to make sure children and farmworkers are protected.”, In the US, Corteva’s biggest market for chlorpyrifos, demand is less than 20% of what it was during its peak in the 1990s, the company said. Industry sales were $350m in 2005, down 45% from 1990, according to Corteva, which sells chlorpyrifos under the Lorsban brand., By weight, estimated use dropped to under 5m pounds in 2016 from about 13m pounds in 1994, according to US Geological Survey data., Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement that the Corteva announcement meant “the end of chlorpyrifos is finally in sight”., “Ridding the American marketplace of this pesticide is a huge step, but it cannot be allowed to continue to threaten the health of kids in other global markets,” she added., Reuters contributed reportingchlorpyrifos pesticide corteva trump administration", "label": 0}, "train-234": {"text": "\nTerror police's Extinction Rebellion 'risk report' sent out a year ago\n, Police say Rising Up report was commissioned as group had a ‘large following’ and concluded XR was not a threat, \nVikram Dodd and \nJamie Grierson, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 15.18 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 6 Feb 2020 13.00 EST\n\n, Counter-terrorism chiefs ordered a formal assessment of whether Extinction Rebellion was a national security threat one year ago and then sent a secret report about the group to police forces, the Guardian has learned., The revelation shows that counter-terrorism police’s interest in the non-violent climate emergency group began earlier and was more extensive than previously thought., Police insist that the confidential assessment, which was titled Rising Up, concluded that XR was not a terrorist or extremist threat, and was sent to regional counter-terrorism units and “policing partners”. They have declined to give any more detail about what it covered., The document from the Counter Terrorism Policing’s National Operations Centre (CTPNOC) was marked as sensitive and produced in February 2019, soon after XR was formed in October 2018. It was needed, police say, because the group was attracting a “large following” and counter-terrorism specialists needed to assess their “goals and methods”., The Guardian first revealed that a counter-terrorism document from November 2019 labelled XR as extremist last month, which police apologised for and withdrew only after its existence was made public., Then revelations about CTP documents from June 2019, titled “Signs and Symbols”, listing XR and other peaceful groups such as Greenpeace and Peta, alongside banned terrorists and extremists, caused anger and claims from activists that freedom of protest and thought were being threatened., The non-violent groups were alarmed to discover that the documents had been circulated as part of Prevent briefings for teachers and medical staff, to help them spot people at risk of falling into terrorism. Both leading Labour politicians and one Conservative heavyweight have voiced their concerns., The Guardian further understands that Counter Terrorism Policing headquarters (CTPHQ) produced documents about non-violent protest groups. , An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said: “We all agree public safety is paramount. However, if CTP is used as a blunt instrument, it is a threat to human rights., “We are concerned about how far, how long and how intrusive this investigation might have been and the ongoing implications. We would request that the police make this top secret Rising Up report available to the public alongside any other reports.”, Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP recently re-elected as chair of the home affairs select committee, said: “Following the recall of CTP guidance on Extinction Rebellion last month, we need to know whether this report that was circulated to police forces across the country also contained wrong information or categorisation., “We need to know whether the Home Office has seen this report and if they have taken any necessary actions. They need to show leadership and responsibility on this so the public can maintain confidence in the crucially important counter-terror work the police do.”, After police were contacted about the document, the UK’s senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism, deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, decided to explain counter-terrorism police’s interest in XR., Speaking to the Guardian, Haydon said that producing Rising Up was the right thing to do: “When a protest group is gaining influence and beginning to attract a large following, it is necessary for policing to assess that group’s goals and methods to see whether they pose a security threat or are at risk of attracting extremists who might be a threat to the public. This also provides forces with important information that can help them facilitate peaceful protest., “Because of our national remit and access to information from across the UK via all 43 police forces, Counter Terrorism Policing has been in a unique position to produce this guidance. We did so in the case of Extinction Rebellion, and as we have already said, we do not consider them to be a counter-terrorism risk.”, He added: “That’s an assessment that’s been produced internally for CT professionals.”, On the Signs and Symbols document, Haydon said he regretted any offence, and offered to meet peaceful groups offended by their inclusion., He said it and other CTP documents would be amended, but not withdrawn: “We’re updating and refreshing it. And then secondly, if certain groups are in there, if it has caused offence, then we are reaching out to those groups to come and have a conversation with us, so we can explain the wider context.”, Protest groups suspect and fear unwarranted police interest in them. The revelations this month have only fanned those longstanding concerns., Rosalind Comyn, from Liberty, said: “Knowing that any one of us could be treated as a possible national security threat if we engage in activism acts as a deterrent to us speaking out against the state, and that is deeply worrying. These actions threaten the traditions of activism and peaceful protest we have always used to protect our rights and stand up to power.”, Haydon said CTP had to have an interest in public order issues and would continue to do so, because groups such as National Action and al-Muhajiroun had started on the street with demonstrations then morphed into terrorist threats. Both are now banned., But the counter-terrorism chief, the second most senior in the UK, said he wanted to get out of the business of producing guides on groups for mainstream policing dealing with protest groups. , Haydon said: “So what we’re doing at the moment is transferring responsibility for public order matters lock, stock and barrel into mainstream policing. That’s going to take some time. So Signs and Symbols documents, policy and some of the other stuff we do that I’ve explained are moving to mainstream policing.”, He said police chiefs from every force in England and Wales, as well as from counter-terrorism policing, met after the Guardian’s revelations. , One force that received a copy of Rising Up was Police Scotland, the second biggest force in the UK., One source said it had been “copied and pasted” and used as the basis for briefings on XR for its local Contest liaison officers (LCLOs), who deliver the Prevent programme to schools and others. Contest is the name for the government’s counter-terrorism strategy., The briefings are revealed in Police Scotland reports written for Angus council and Dundee city council., One report reads: “Extinction Rebellion briefings were provided to local Contest liaison police officers in Angus. Extinction Rebellion (XR) is a UK-born international movement, which aims for nothing less than global civil disobedience to pressure governments across the world to act on climate breakdown and species extinctions.”, Chf Supt Andrew Todd, Police Scotland’s divisional commander for Tayside, said: “Our Contest liaison officers provide advice to partners on a whole range of issues, some of which are not related to terrorism.” , Additional reporting by Russell Scottterrorism police assessed extinction rebellion earlier than thought", "label": 0}, "train-235": {"text": "\nBumblebees' decline points to mass extinction – study\n, Populations disappearing in areas where temperatures are getting hotter, scientists say, PA Media, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 14.00 EST\n\n, Bumblebees are in drastic decline across Europe and North America owing to hotter and more frequent extremes in temperatures, scientists say., A study suggests the likelihood of a bumblebee population surviving in any given place has declined by 30% in the course of a single human generation. The researchers say the rates of decline appear to be “consistent with a mass extinction”., Peter Soroye, a PhD student at the University of Ottawa and the study’s lead author, said: “We found that populations were disappearing in areas where the temperatures had gotten hotter. If declines continue at this pace, many of these species could vanish forever within a few decades.”, The team used data collected over a 115-year period on 66 bumblebee species across North America and Europe to develop a model simulating “climate chaos” scenarios. They were able to see how bumblebee populations had changed over the years by comparing where the insects were now to where they used to be., Dr Tim Newbold, of University College London’s Centre for Biodiversity &amp; Environment Research, said: “We were surprised by how much climate change has already caused bumblebee declines. Our findings suggest that much larger declines are likely if climate change accelerates in the coming years, showing that we need substantial efforts to reduce climate change if we are to preserve bumblebee diversity.”, Bumblebees play a key role in pollinating crops such as tomatoes, squash and berries. The researchers say their methods could be used to predict extinction risk and identify areas where conservation actions are needed., Prof Jeremy Kerr, of the University of Ottawa and the study’s senior author, said: “This work also holds out hope by implying ways that we might take the sting out of climate change for these and other organisms by maintaining habitats that offer shelter, like trees, shrubs or slopes, that could let bumblebees get out of the heat., “Ultimately, we must address climate change itself and every action we take to reduce emissions will help.”, The research is published in the journal Science.bumblebees decline points to mass extinction study", "label": 0}, "train-236": {"text": "\nHumanity under threat from perfect storm of crises – study\n, Climate, extreme weather, biodiversity, food and water crises could lead to ‘systemic collapse’, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 13.32 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 13.36 EST\n\n, The world is facing a series of interlinked emergencies that are threatening the existence of humans, because the sum of the effects of the crises is much greater than their individual impacts, according to a new global study., Climate breakdown and extreme weather, species loss, water scarcity and a food production crisis are all serious in themselves, but the combination of all five together is amplifying the risks of each, creating a perfect storm that threatens to engulf humanity unless swift action is taken., The links among the crises are clear in many cases, but the methods the world has chosen to try to solve them do not take account of these connecting factors. For instance, extreme heatwaves can add to global heating, because they release vast amounts of stored carbon from affected ecosystems, in a feedback loop. It has been seen clearly in the Australian bushfires, which are already contributing significantly to the store of carbon in the atmosphere., The links do not stop there: as the heatwaves damage natural ecosystems, killing off wildlife and flora, they also lead to greater water scarcity, and in turn damage agriculture. These combined effects exacerbate the harm done to people struggling with food and water shortages, in a vicious cycle., Faced with these crises in nature individually, it could be possible to fix the problems causing them. But confronted with multiple interlinked emergencies that in combination amplify one another’s impacts, people are facing unprecedented dangers and many communities cannot cope., The report, which took the form of a survey of 222 leading scientists from 52 countries, conducted by the international sustainability network Future Earth, found that the responses to these emergencies by governments, civil society, business and institutions did not recognise their interlinked nature. Trying to solve the problems individually, without taking account of the “cascading” impacts, was likely to be ineffective, the scientists said., More than a third of the scientists surveyed said the five crisis types would worsen one another “in ways that might cascade to create global systemic collapse”., While the risks are amplified when they are connected, so too are the solutions, however. Whenever action is taken to remedy environmental problems, the benefits also cascade: for instance, nurturing wildlife and flora in a wetland can also reduce water pollution and soil erosion, and protect crops against storm damage, alleviating water scarcity and allowing for more food production., “Despite the ubiquity of connections between these looming crises many scientists and policymakers are embedded in institutions that are used to thinking and acting on isolated risks, one at a time,” the report says. “This needs to change, to thinking about risks as connected.”, Amy Luers, the executive director of Future Earth, said: “2020 is a critical time to look at these issues. Our actions in the next decade will determine our collective future on Earth.”, The authors of the report urged a change in the way risks were handled: “We call on the world’s academics, business leaders and policymakers to pay urgent attention to these five global risks, and to ensure they are treated as interacting systems, rather than addressed one at a time in isolation.”, The report also warned of social problems that scientists identified as potential major risks for the future. These included the rise of populism and fake news, trends in migration and the rise of artificial intelligence.humanity under threat perfect storm crises study environment", "label": 0}, "train-237": {"text": "\nScottish animal welfare baffled by python mutilation in Aberdeen\n, Two dead 5ft snakes were discovered at a nature reserve within a month of each other , PA Media, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 10.33 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 14.05 EST\n\n, A python has been found dead, slit open along the length of its body, while another was found in pieces, prompting an investigation at a nature reserve in Scotland., The 1.5-metre (5ft) snakes were discovered within a month of each other at Den of Maidencraig in Skene Road, Aberdeen.

I think this could really move us to the next stage in terms of how we work on the water issue.”, There are 15,700 combined sewerage overflows where the EA permits water companies to discharge untreated sewage into rivers in extreme weather conditions, according to WWF figures. But WWF analysis shows the overflows are discharging sewage far more often than they should be., Just 14% of rivers are rated as good under the EU water framework directive, which provides a baseline quality for the health of wildlife and habitats in inland waters., The scale of the pollution that regularly occurs is shrouded in secrecy. Water companies are allowed to monitor their own discharges and do not release real-time data on how often, and for how long, combined sewerage overflows release sewage into any particular river. Campaigners say the permits to discharge are licences to pollute and want the rules changed., Members of the public are increasingly turning to the water quality test – bathing water status – which is applied to coastal waters to make it clear they are safe to swim in., Thomas said: “There are hundreds of swimming spots in rivers that have been used for generations in this country, and it is unacceptable that water quality isn’t monitored there. That is now putting people’s health at risk. So everyone should apply for bathing water status for the rivers they use, because that is exactly what the system is in place for.”, Howard Boyd said: “Water quality absolutely needs to improve, but we also need to recognise that it is a complex combination of action that will allow water quality to improve. I am very clear that it is something that we need to continue to apply urgency and effort to.”, She said that while discharges from combined sewerage outflows were permitted under licences from the agency, a move towards turning rivers – or parts of them – into bathing water areas would mark a significant shift of what was expected in terms of river water quality. But it would require more funding from government., “We need to make sure there is adequate funding and resources in order to reach the standards,” said Howard Boyd. “We need to make sure that the funding does come through if this happens. Those are the discussions that we will need to have with Defra.”, She defended her agency’s record in monitoring water companies, saying it had been working closely with the watchdog Ofwat to draw up the wholesale price controls for water companies from 2020-25, the PR19, to ensure that water quality in rivers and investment in infrastructure were a key part of spending for the five-year period. The £51bn PR19 includes spending of £4.8bn on reducing pollution, leakage and water use., “We are very keen to make sure that that money is invested in delivering water improvement – £5bn is a significant amount to be spent on that,” she said., Howard Boyd pointed to fines, including £20m against Thames Water in 2017, as evidence that the agency was taking a tough approach to incidents of unlicensed pollution., Ash Smith, the founder of Wasp, welcomed Boyd’s comments. On his group’s plan to apply for bathing water status on the Windrush, he said: “It is the only way that we can see to get the Environment Agency, the water industry and the government to start treating our waterways with respect … We are going backwards in terms of water quality.

Does this discourage men from taking responsibility?, \nElle Hunt, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 04.00 EST\n\n, It was not long ago that, if you wanted to reduce the impact of your consumer choices on the environment, your only option was to use your own shopping bag. These days, the eco-minded shopper is overwhelmed with “green” choices. With the rise of reusable pads and menstrual cups, your period can now be plastic-free. Cosmetics increasingly come in glass and aluminium containers. Even hosiery brands are swapping nylon for more eco-friendly material., Given the devastating toll of consumer waste on the health of the planet, you may find this visible drive towards sustainability on supermarket shelves cheering. But if you are a man, you may not have even noticed it: most eco-friendly products are marketed to women., There is an obvious (and depressing) reason for this: women are not only more powerful consumers, but also disproportionately responsible, still, for the domestic sphere. The result of this is what the market research firm Mintel has termed an “eco gender gap”, where green branding might as well be pink., In a 2018 report by Mintel on the subject, Jack Duckett, a senior consumer lifestyles analyst, said women “still tend to take charge of the running of the household”, with laundry, cleaning and recycling falling under that banner. But “with eco-friendly campaigns and product claims largely aimed at female audiences”, advertisers run the risk of communicating the message that sustainability is women’s work., The idea is already insidious due to the persistent portrayal of women as caregivers – even of the planet. Janet K Swim, a professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University who has done extensive research into the social consequences of environmentally friendly behaviour, points to a political cartoon showing Theodore Roosevelt, the US president from 1901 to 1909, wearing an apron, “trying to mock him as feminine” for his conservation policies., While it is true that women are more likely than men to be green, in the past that gender gap has been attributed to personality differences. Research from the mid-90s to early 00s pointed to women’s greater tendency to be prosocial, altruistic and empathetic; to display a stronger ethic of care; and to assume a future-focused perspective. “Research suggests that women have higher levels of socialisation to care about others and be socially responsible, which then leads them to care about environmental problems and be willing to adopt environmental behaviours,” says Rachel Howell, a lecturer in sustainable development (a subject that is, she notes, studied overwhelmingly by women at undergraduate level) at the University of Edinburgh., Whether women are born caring about the planet or learn to do so, there is evidence to suggest that femininity and “greenness” have come to be cognitively linked (by men and women) – and that this, as absurd as it may sound, is partly what puts off men from doing their bit., In a study published last year in the journal Sex Roles, Swim and her fellow researchers at Penn State found that men could be disinclined to carry a reusable shopping bag – or recycle, or any environmentally friendly activity that had been gendered as feminine – for fear of being perceived as gay or effeminate. (The same concern has been well established as a factor in men’s reluctance to adopt vegetarian or vegan diets.), One study found that men could be disinclined to carry a reusable shopping bag for fear of being perceived as gay, Similarly, a 2016 paper in the Journal of Consumer Research found that “men may be motivated to avoid or even oppose green behaviours in order to safeguard their gender identity” and that their participation could be encouraged by weakening the association between femininity and sustainability, such as “by using masculine rather than conventional green branding”., Plastic Freedom and Package Free Shop, two popular zero-waste online retailers, say they are careful to use gender-neutral marketing – but both say about 90% of their customers are women. Lauren Singer, the founder of Package Free Shop, which sells items such as bamboo cutlery and eco cleaning products, suggests that the imbalance presents women with an opportunity to lead. “Let’s be the ones that absorb the responsibility of being the stewards and educators of sustainability,” she says., But with analysis in 2016 from the Office for National Statistics showing that women carry out an average of 60% more unpaid work than men, Howell’s suggestion may hold more appeal: to close the eco gender gap, close the associated gap “in terms of who does the laundry, who does the grocery shopping, who does the cleaning at home”. Also, get rid of “false ideas of what a sustainable product must look like”, she says, pointing out that men may carry a rucksack or reusable sports bottle without it being sold or perceived as green., The British men’s skincare company Bulldog stands out for making sustainability a cornerstone of its brand. Its plastic tubes are derived from sugar cane, not fossil fuel; it sells bamboo-handled razors and shower gel in cardboard packs; and its Original Moisturiser is certified carbon-neutral. “We’ve never thought that there’s really a gender perspective on the idea of sustainability,” says Simon Duffy, the brand’s founder. “It’s a crazy idea to me, that that is considered more feminine than masculine. Everybody should be focused on this.”, For female beauty brands, sustainability may well be a way of standing out in a crowded market, says Duffy (for male beauty, “the challenge is getting men to use these types of products at all”) – but commitment should not be only skin deep. “We’re trying to make it inherent to everything we do,” he says, “because it’s the right thing to do. It doesn’t have to be a marketing story. Companies that try to use that as a tactic to sell more products are missing the point.”, It is a reminder that, for a company to be truly green, its attention to sustainability should extend to every level of its business – not just the one that draws consumers. Areeba Hamid, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace, says the impact of individual choices – even giving up meat or air travel on a large scale – is negligible: “If the corporations keep drilling for oil and gas, that is not going to amount to anything.”, Howell says: “While individual action is important, the individualisation of responsibility can go too far. We have got to look at the whole and try to do something at a societal level.”, Even arguments about meaningful action on the climate crisis are are split down gender lines. Another study by Swim, published in the journal Global Environmental Change last year, showed that men preferred arguments that centred on science and business and tended to “attribute negative feminine traits” to men who argued on the basis of ethics and environmental justice – as women typically did., Women tend to have less trust in institutions, Howell says, which may mean they have less faith in the ability of science, technology and the government to address the issues that face us. Men, however, having been historically well served by the status quo, “are much more inclined to believe that, if they accept there is a problem, then somebody or some technology will sort it all out – that we don’t need to change our lifestyle”., Misogyny has been shown to be a factor in climate denial. A 2014 paper in the International Journal for Masculinity Studies found that: “For climate sceptics, it was not the environment that was threatened; it was a certain kind of modern industrial society built and dominated by their form of masculinity.” As Martin Gelin wrote last year in the New Republic, the highest-profile climate campaigners in the world today are two young women: Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Those shouting them down are primarily older conservative men., “Occasionally, I feel quite angry,” says Howell, “because a lot of the problems have historically been created more by men, because they have more power, but it sometimes seems that women are getting more desperate about trying to solve them – and maybe have less power to do it.”, But the world is changing. Millennials and Generation Z (those born between the early 80s and the mid-00s) have been shown to align broadly on the climate crisis, according to recent data compiled in the US by the Pew Research Center; even young Republicans are more likely to say that governments need to do more. “If you look at the youth climate movement, and Greta, there are a lot of young men as well as women,” says Hamid. “I think this is generational.”, Duffy says that brands are changing, too. More than two-thirds (68%) of Europeans rate being environmentally friendly as more important to them than it was five years ago, according to a European Consumer Packaging Perceptions survey from 2018. For 19- to 29-year-olds, it was 80%., While some companies will change their ways only when forced, Duffy looks to Adidas’s range of trainers made from upcycled ocean plastic, and the footwear company Allbirds, as examples of those with “sustainable stories”, irrespective of the gender of their target market. “It’s certainly seeping in,” he says. “If you’re a man and you’re not picking up that this is important, something is wrong.”, Additional reporting by Ruby Abbisseco gender gap why saving planet seen womens work", "label": 0}, "train-240": {"text": "\nModern ark: designs for the new climate reality – in pictures\n, Modern ark: designs for the new climate reality – in pictures, Floating villages and an ‘amphibious house’ are among some of the solutions as architecture adapts to the growing problem of urban flooding, • Sea Change: Flood Resilient Architecture for the 21st Century is at the Roca London Gallery, until 16 May, \nJo Blason, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2020 05.23 EST\n\n, Photograph: BIG–Bjarke Ingels Group, Photograph: KCAP+Felixx, Photograph: Adrien Giret/Stinessen Arkitektur, Photograph: George Steinmetz/Hollandse Hoogte, Photograph: BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group, Photograph: SLA, Photograph: Patsy Lynch/FEMA, Photograph: Greg Henshall/FEMA, Photograph: Darren Chung, Photograph: Fernando Gomulya, Photograph: Elbe&amp;Flut, Photograph: Tim Corvin Kraus, Photograph: White Arkitekter Oslo, Photograph: Piet Niemann/Zaha Hadid Architects, Photograph: Aldayjover Architecturemodern ark designs for the new climate reality in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-241": {"text": "\nJohnson urged to set out firm plans for UK's net-zero carbon target\n, Campaigners call on PM to ‘show UK is ready to do what it takes’ before COP 26 summit, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 02.03 EST\n\n, Boris Johnson must flesh out plans for the UK to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 if he is to make a success of the COP 26 climate summit, campaigners have said., The government has not yet set out firm plans or systematic new measures aimed at reaching the net-zero target, which was enshrined in law by Theresa May last summer., Meeting the target will require sweeping changes to the UK’s economy and infrastructure, from energy generation to transport, housing to farming and consumer goods to food. Nearly every major government department is likely to be involved in some way., Launching the UK’s presidency of the crunch UN climate meeting, set for Glasgow this November, Johnson highlighted only one major new policy – bringing forward the planned phase-out of diesel and petrol vehicles from 2040 to 2035 – and appeared to rely on the achievements of past governments to burnish the UK’s green credentials., While few new policies have been brought forward since last summer, the government has signalled its intent to push forward with policies and projects that could lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, from road-building and coal-mining to the expansion of Heathrow and the potential review of air passenger duty., Johnson has promised more tree-planting but this fell well short of targets last year, and the promised incentives for farmers to use their land to store carbon are still years off, despite the new agriculture bill., Meanwhile, other policy areas – such as renewable energy, home insulation, domestic energy efficiency and building regulations – have languished, receiving little ministerial attention., “It’s great for the prime minister to show leadership and launch the UK’s COP presidency – his personal leadership will be essential if our presidency is to be a success, not least by ensuring that his ministers deliver and the UK gets on track to delivering net zero,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of Green Alliance. , “But the lack of a COP president at the launch was pretty embarrassing – this vacancy must be filled quickly – and the paucity of detail or substance in Johnson’s speech was worrying. Willpower, tech and a can-do attitude are important, but in themselves will neither enable the UK to reach net zero, nor deliver a successful COP.”, Aaron Kiely, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the UK was “woefully off track” in bringing emissions down to the levels needed to meet net zero by mid-century., He called for drastic action: “The prime minister could show real international leadership on the climate crisis by scrapping plans for new roads and runways, and ending government support for gas, coal and oil developments at home and abroad.”, Johnson faced embarrassment at the recent UK-Africa summit, where he announced an end to new British investment in African coal, despite there having been no such investment by the UK since 2002. At the same summit, nearly £2bn of new deals on African oil and gas were announced, leading to accusations of hypocrisy., Kiely said new jobs could be created by investing in renewable energy, public transport and a nationwide energy efficiency programme. There is currently no national scheme for home insulation and energy efficiency – the last one was abandoned nearly five years ago - and onshore wind farm construction levels have fallen sharply as government support has been withdrawn and planning obstacles put in the way of new turbines. Only one new onshore wind farm was started in 2019., Next month’s budget would be the ideal opportunity for the government to switch track, and bring forward concrete new measures on the climate crisis, said Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s policy director., “We know Boris Johnson can talk the talk on climate, but in terms of walking it, he has been no Usain Bolt,” he said. “The prime minister needs to use next month’s budget to show that Britain is ready to do what it takes to tackle the climate emergency. , “We don’t need more long-term targets and pledges, we need concrete measures such as banning new oil and gas drilling, rocket-boosting renewable energy and directing 5% of government spending towards tackling the climate and nature emergency.

This stuff is shield lichen, Parmelia sulcata, which is still alive, even though the branches it grew on are now rotting on the ground. Shield lichen is a foliose lichen, the ones that form leafy lobes called thalli. These are about 5mm wide, loosely attached in sprawly rosettes, and grow on branches, twigs and tree trunks. From a distance, the lichen is silvery grey but looking closer, the thalli have a bluey-green cast., Lichens are an intimate association, a symbiosis, between different and unrelated microorganisms – alga and fungus. The shield lichen is a community that includes Marchandiomyces and Nesolechia fungi, which create the architecture that harbours the single-celled green alga Trebouxia – a photobiont, turning sunlight into carbohydrates for the fungi and receiving some nutrients and vitamins in return. Shield lichen are fairly resistant to pollution and so are cosmopolitan and common, and their thalli grow 2mm-5mm in a year. There are some species, particularly those growing on rock in the Arctic, that only grow 0.5mm a year and there are individuals that are 5,000 years old., The study of lichenometry over the past 25 years uses the growth rates of lichens to tell the story of climatic change and how long rock surfaces and glacial deposits in the Arctic have been exposed. That these complex and sophisticated living communities of very different organisms can be read as historical documents is fascinating. Looking at the shield lichen under the trees growing on something that is already dead, I wonder what it can tell us. Will the chronicles in its thalli be read like ancient illuminated texts that hold secrets about what lies beyond the world as we see it? Is it sensitive to extra-terrestrial forces? Did it pick up anything from the “heatwave” of masers – microwave lasers – that burst from the new star, called G358-MM1, 22,000 light years away last year?, We are, despite our destructive self-obsessions, communities of organisms affected by the universe. With only this rapidly changing planet to cling to like a dead stick, perhaps lichens can also be read as the poetry of peaceful coexistence.country diary tiny shield lichen tell a big story", "label": 0}, "train-243": {"text": "\n'No tigers here': why Goa is in denial about its big cat population\n, \n'No tigers here': why Goa is in denial about its big cat population\n, Officials claim there are no tigers in Goa. But the poisoning of a mother and three cubs has forced the issue into the open, \nHannah Ellis-Petersen in Mhadei, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 00.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 16.11 EST\n\n, As a child living in the Vagheri hills at the foot of the Western Ghats, Rajendra Kerkar would often hear the majestic roar of tigers echo across the mountains. It was never greeted with fear by the villagers in this remote corner of northern Goa; the name Vagheri translates as “home of the tigers” and coexistence with India’s national animal was part of their way of life., Yet according to state authorities, these tigers do not exist; or if they do, they are just passing through. Unlike other states in India, where the presence of tigers has been celebrated, embraced and in many cases exploited for tourism, Goa’s tigers have instead been subjected to a strange charade, whereby their existence has repeatedly been denied or covered up by those in government., Officials and local community leaders have been feeding the fear of tiger reserves to locals to serve their own agenda, So when a mother and her three cubs were found dead in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in the Sattari region of Goa last month, allegedly poisoned by disgruntled locals, the deaths – one of the biggest losses to India’s tiger population in years – brought an uncomfortable issue to the surface., “I have spent my whole life tracking tigers, so I know they are living in Goa,” says Kerkar, a well-known environmental activist in the state. “But even with all these years of proof, still the government have failed to acknowledge tigers in Goa. They have looked away to serve their economic interests, to keep on cutting down the forests for mines and tourism until there will be nothing left for the tigers.”, Tigers have been touted by India as one of its great environmental success stories, with the most recent figures showing the population now at close to 3,000, a third higher than four years ago. Although there has been some dispute over the numbers, prime minister Narendra Modi presented the most recent tiger census with the claim that India was “now one of the biggest and most secure habitats of the tiger”., The currently unprotected area of the Western Ghats in Goa forms a crucial part of the tiger corridor running from Maharashtra to Karnataka, which activists and the WWF have described as “the best and only hope for the continued survival of the tigers of India”., But in a state heavily dependent on tourism, real estate and, until recently, iron ore mining, protecting the tiger’s forest habitat has been portrayed as a threat to industry and development. “If you are using wildlife to block the economy, you create enemies of wildlife,” said Goa’s chief minister, Manohar Parrikar, in 2013., Despite tigers first being officially recorded in Goa in 2002, and the tiger census and local rangers putting the current population in Goa between five and 10, there is still no tiger reserve in the state and therefore no official protection., “The Goa state government has been trying to suppress the presence of tigers for at least the past 40 years for the simple reason of mining and real estate,” says activist Abhijit Prabhudesai., One issue driving the resistance is that creating a tiger reserve would mean establishing a buffer zone around the protected forest. This no-build area would encroach on land already occupied by extractive industries or owned by powerful landlords. While the supreme court banned mining in Goa in 2018, many expect it to eventually resume, but a tiger reserve would make that less likely. Some Goa government figures have business interests linked to mining., A shroud of secrecy surrounds the tigers in this part of northern Goa, where locals will deny ever having seen one, or scurry away whenever tigers are mentioned. Resistance to a tiger reserve is strong. “No tigers here,” says one woman interviewed by the Guardian, despite the fact that according to local reports the night before her cow had been killed by a tiger., “It is government officials and local community leaders who have been feeding the fear of tiger reserves to locals to serve their own agenda, so they can keep tearing up the land for hotels and mines,” Prabhudesai adds. “They have been telling them that if you accept the presence of the tigers then you will be relocated and you will be thrown out from your villages. Fear has been planted in the minds of the people.”, After the four tiger deaths, denials from the state government once again emerged. “Tigers found in the wild in Sattari are basically transitory tigers, coming from Karnataka,” said Vishwajit Rane, Goa’s health minister, who represents the district where the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary is located. “I will not allow the tiger reserve in Sattari,” he added. “Environmentalists don’t run Sattari, people there do. No one has the right to declare Sattari a tiger reserve and we will not allow it.”, Rane’s comments are the latest in a long line of official flip-flopping between acceptance and denial on tigers since Mhadei was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1999. But as the killings demonstrated, it has led to a failure to deal with an increasingly vexed relationship between humans and tigers in Goa., While the state is 60% forest, only 33% of it is protected. As forests have either been cut down or filled with monoculture crops such as cashew trees, which destroy the native ecosystem, tigers have been driven closer to human habitation in search of food and water. Here, according to reports from locals who asked to remain anonymous, they regularly attack the livestock – mainly cattle and water buffalo – so essential to the villagers. Were the area an official tiger reserve, locals would be entitled to compensation for lost livestock or personal injuries. As it is, such compensation is difficult to claim, and so resentment builds., There are local leaders and officials that tell us when our cattle are attacked by tigers, we need to not talk about it, This resentment appears to have led to the deaths of the four tigers in January, when people living on the fringes of the sanctuary are alleged to have taken matters into their own hands after a tiger killed livestock in late December. According to the forest department, a poisoned water buffalo carcass was put out as bait and eaten by the tiger and her cubs., The five accused men, who asked not to be identified, denied killing the tigers and said their confessions were beaten out of them while in custody, where they were also made to sign documents they could not read as they are illiterate. This was denied by the forest department. But the villagers said they had suffered the consequences of tiger attack for years, and had been given no assistance by the forest department, the government body responsible for the Mhadei sanctuary., “Once a year we lose a cow or a buffalo in an attack and so it is very scary and frustrating for us because we don’t know what to do,” says one of the men. “The forest department give us no help, they leave us on our own. All they do when they come here is harass us and pressure us.”, It was a similar story in the nearby village of Derode, where a water buffalo had been killed the night before. No one would discuss the attack except for 65-year-old Ganesh Cholekar, who defiantly says he has “no reason to be scared and not to speak the truth”. , “There are local leaders and officials that tell us when our cattle are attacked by tigers, we need to not talk about it and if anyone asks, say that we have never seen a tiger in the vicinity,” says Cholekar. “Over the past five years, more attacks have been happening because they come down to the village for water.”, He adds: “We are helpless against them and we don’t get compensation and so in some people’s mind they do think about killing the tigers, just to make it stop.”, Crucially, the issue of the settlement rights of 31 villagers living inside or on the edge of the Mhadei sanctuary has yet to be resolved. If environmental protections were increased and the sanctuary declared a tiger reserve, the villagers would have to leave, and would be entitled to compensation. According to Santosh Kumar, chief wildlife warden for the forest department, these land rights remain the greatest obstacle to declaring a tiger reserve. Kumar says Goa’s chief minister, Pramod Sawant, has vowed to make it a priority., “Of course there are tigers living in Goa’s wildlife sanctuaries,” says Kumar. “The issue has been delayed for over 20 years but now we have faced the deaths of these four tigers the government is ready to act.”, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresno tigers here why goa india is in denial about its big cat population aoe", "label": 0}, "train-244": {"text": "\nElectric vehicle sales triple in Australia as sales of combustion engine cars fall 8%\n, Despite the strong growth over 2019, electric vehicles still only represent 0.6% of total sales, \nAdam Morton Environment editor, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 21.20 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 21.22 EST\n\n, Electric vehicle sales in Australia more than tripled last year but were still far lower than in a majority of developed countries, industry data shows., The Electric Vehicle Council says 6,718 full electric and hybrid plug-in vehicles were sold in 2019, up from 2,216 the year before. Sales of combustion engine cars fell 7.8% over that period., The release of the industry group data follows Britain this week announcing it would ban new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035. The Electric Vehicle Council said the spike in sales in Australia from a low base suggested consumers wanted the technology despite it being yet to receive the support offered elsewhere., “The good news is that the number of Australians buying EVs is surging despite a lack of government incentives or support,” the council’s chief executive, Beyhad Jafari, said. “The bad news is that even with this strong growth, EVs still only represent 0.6% of sales. That compares poorly with 3.8% of sales in Europe and 4.7% of sales in China.”, Support for EVs was a significant point of difference between the major parties at last year’s federal election. Labor promised a target of 50% new car sales being electric by 2030., The prime minister, Scott Morrison, accused the opposition of wanting to “end the weekend” by forcing people out of four-wheel drives, while the minister for small business, Michaelia Cash, told tradies only the Coalition would “save their utes”., But the government has promised its own national EV strategy, to be finalised by the middle of the year, and government agency data has forecast that half the new cars sold will be electric by 2035 even if there is no policy to support their uptake., The Coalition considered introducing the vehicle emissions standards proposed by Labor, which would have required light cars to on average emit 105 grams of CO2 per kilometre, and received advice it would have a net economic benefit, but decided against it., Jafari estimated if Australia offered similar incentives as Europe and China there would be 50,000 new EVs on Australian roads. “Given that Australian decision makers at all levels are eager to start taking stronger action on climate change, transitioning away from combustion engine vehicles would be an excellent place to start,” he said., The British prime minister, the Conservatives’ Boris Johnson, announced on Tuesday a ban on selling cars that were not fully electric would be brought forward from 2040 to 2035. He said it would come even earlier if possible., Electric vehicles remain on average significantly more expensive than combustion engine cars, though the number of cheaper models is expanding. Analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance have projected a rapid fall in the cost of lithium ion batteries will lead to EVs being as cheap as petrol equivalents by 2025., In August, a transport and infrastructure department spokeswoman acknowledged electric car uptake in Australia was slow compared with other countries and said there would be a rapid change in new car sales once the technology was price competitive., But the spokeswoman said it would take some time for that to be reflected on Australian roads. “EVs are not expected to be a significant part of the passenger vehicle fleet until well into the 2030s,” she said.electric vehicle sales triple in australia as sales of combustion engine cars fall 8", "label": 0}, "train-245": {"text": "\nUK taxpayers funding African fossil fuel projects worth $750m\n, Watchdog reveals huge sum ploughed into ‘world’s dirtiest fossil fuels’ despite climate vow, \nJillian Ambrose Energy correspondent, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 19.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 19.04 EST\n\n, UK taxpayer funds totalling $750m (£577m) have been invested in new fossil fuel projects in developing African countries despite the government’s public commitment to tackling the climate crisis, according to an international watchdog., Global Witness found that a London-based investment group raised $1bn from the UK government over 16 years and spent three-quarters of this supporting oil and gas projects in some of Africa’s poorest countries., The Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), which relies on the UK taxpayer for two-thirds of its funding, committed $750m to fossil fuel projects between 2002 and 2018, including recent investments in heavy fuel oil power plants in Senegal and Mali., Since then, the group’s investments have included $24m for a gas plant in Togo and $31m for a gas plant expansion project in Ivory Coast., Adam McGibbon, a campaigner at Global Witness, said “not a penny of public money” should be used on fossil fuel infrastructure., “The British public will quite rightly be appalled to know that their tax money is being used to finance some of the world’s dirtiest fossil fuels, ultimately contributing to climate change,” he said., “It flies in the face of claims by the UK government, ahead of hosting a major UN climate summit this year, that the UK is a global leader in fighting climate change.”, The report is likely to reignite concerns that UK international aid designed to help support infrastructure in developing countries is instead increasing reliance of those states on oil and gas., Last year the government was taken to task by the environmental audit committee for sending billions of pounds overseas to help build fossil fuel power plants while claiming a climate victory on home soil., Global Witness said the government should immediately end all fossil fuel investments and commit to using UK taxpayer money solely to fund clean energy., A spokeswoman for the PIDG said the fund was “acutely aware that infrastructure development has the potential to lock in future carbon emissions patterns” and that the countries it invested in were “the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change”., The fund has said it would prioritise renewable energy projects in its investment plans, and had already invested a total of $711m in renewable energy infrastructure in recent years. It has also banned investments in coal, to align with global commitments made through the Paris agreement on climate change., But the investor would continue to use UK taxpayer funds to support oil and gas infrastructure in countries where the need for electricity is urgent, the spokeswoman added., The Global Witness report says: “It is difficult to see how supporting further fossil fuel projects is in any way in line with Paris agreement commitments. Fossil fuels hinder, rather than help, development … there is no longer any justification for supporting fossil fuel power generation with aid.”, A Department for International Development spokesman said: “We know developing countries rely on energy from a range of sources and the UK can help them move towards clean energy. UK aid support to PIDG is helping achieve this, prioritising investments which mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change in developing countries, and help them adapt.” , The UK’s commitment to supporting oil and gas projects in Africa was at the heart of the UK-Africa investment summit last month. Boris Johnson told delegates “not another penny of UK taxpayers’ money” would be invested in coal, adding that UK companies should help African countries “extract and use oil and gas in the cleanest, greenest way possible”., The Guardian revealed that more than 90% of the £2bn in energy deals struck at the inaugural UK-Africa summit last month were for fossil fuels, despite the government’s commitment to “support African countries in their transition to cleaner energy”.uk taxpayers funding african fossil fuel projects worth 750m", "label": 0}, "train-246": {"text": "\nBig polluters again allowed to lift emissions without penalty\n, The ‘safeguard mechanism’ promised to limit industry’s carbon pollution, but in two years has approved more than 7m tonnes of extra emissions, \nAdam Morton Environment editor, \n\nFri 7 Feb 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2020 22.12 EST\n\n, Mining and heavy industry companies, including BHP and Alcoa, have again been allowed to lift their greenhouse gas emissions without penalty under a climate change policy that the Australian government promised would prevent national pollution increasing., Under changes posted online on Thursday, BHP coal and iron ore mines in Western Australia and Queensland, Alcoa’s Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria and a Boggabri coalmine in New South Wales were each given the green light to emit more under the scheme known as the “safeguard mechanism”., Of those made public, the allowed increases ranged between 3% to 33% above previous emissions limits. Not all the increases were published. Two of three BHP mines moved from annual to multi-year emissions limits, which means they promised to emit less over the next two years to make up for excess emissions last year., The increases were signed off despite the safeguard mechanism’s promise to limit emissions from big polluters to ensure they do not just cancel out cuts paid for by taxpayers through the Coalition’s main climate policy, the emissions reduction fund., Under the scheme, every industrial facility across the country that emits more than 100,000 tonnes a year was set a pollution limit, known as a baseline, based on either its historic emissions or an independent forecast of future emissions., Under changes being introduced this year, all facilities will be moved to limits based not on their total emissions, but on how much they expect to emit per unit of production., The Australian Conservation Foundation found increases approved over the past two years alone allowed more than 7m tonnes of potential extra emissions each year – about 1.3% of annual national carbon pollution., The increases allowed under Thursday’s changes, including those from a new Jemena gas pipeline between Tennant Creek and Mount Isa, are at least 236,658 tonnes a year., Bret Harper, director of research with energy and carbon consultants RepuTex, said it showed the safeguard mechanism was a “pretty ineffective policy”., “The bottom line is there is no accountability for any emissions increases that do occur,” he said., Emissions from electricity generation have reduced and the drought has triggered a drop from agriculture, but cuts in those sectors have been effectively cancelled out by increases, mostly from big industry. Emissions have increased from the liquified natural gas (LNG) industry, mining sector and transport, in particular., Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said national climate policies did not send a strong enough market signal to unlock the private investment needed to put Australia on a path to zero emissions. She said it should take the opportunity to strengthen the safeguards mechanism and other emissions reduction policies after a review led by businessman Grant King and through the development of a long-term emissions reduction strategy., “Unless we provide tighter emissions pathways to net-zero for large emitters it’s hard to see how we can reduce pollution in line with our overarching commitments under the Paris agreement,” Herd said., The Coalition has changed how it describes the safeguard mechanism over time. In 2016, the then environment minister, Greg Hunt, said it would ensure emissions cuts contracted through the emissions reduction fund were not offset by significant increases above business-as-usual levels elsewhere in the economy. But a government climate policy document released before last year’s election said the mechanism required Australia’s largest emitters to “measure, report and manage” their emissions, not that it would limit pollution., An analysis by RepuTex found the government regulator had approved a 32% increase in how much large industrial facilities were allowed to emit under the scheme. While not every company emitted up to their limit, the most recent data, for 2017-18, showed emissions from large industry were up 12% since 2015., Some companies that have exceeded their limit have been expected to buy carbon credits to offset the additional emissions, or pay a penalty. Over the first two years of the scheme companies paid for cuts equivalent to 707,625 tonnes of emissions. The government denies the scheme is a form of carbon pricing., The minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, did not respond to a request for comment before publication.big polluters again allowed to lift emissions without penalty", "label": 0}, "train-247": {"text": "\nThe week in wildlife – in pictures\n, The week in wildlife – in pictures, The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including a baboon with a lion cub and Devon beavers, , \n\nFri 7 Feb 2020 12.56 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2020 14.31 EST\n\n, Photograph: Nic Bothma/EPA, Photograph: Imaginechina/SIPA USA/PA Images, Photograph: Melissa Nolan/Alamy, Photograph: Gillian Pullinger/Alamy Stock Photo, Photograph: Nick Upton/NPL, Photograph: Jesús Diges/EPA, Photograph: Jason Steel/Tufts University/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Idp Wildlife Collection/Alamy Stock Photo, Photograph: Coatsey/Alamy, Photograph: Olaf Kraak/EPA, Photograph: Enrique Castro/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images, Photograph: Shared by Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Parveen Kaswan on Twitter, Photograph: STR/EPA, Photograph: POST, Photograph: Kurt Schultz/AP, Photograph: Chris Walsh of NSW DPI, Photograph: Janice Lorentz/Alamy, Photograph: Courtesy of April Pulley Sayre/Simon &amp; Schuster Children’s Publishingthe week in wildlife in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-248": {"text": "\nCan Boris Johnson be trusted to act on the climate crisis?\n, He has a history of ‘not getting’ global heating but his desire for Britain to be a world leader could be the planet’s hope, Contact author, \n\nFri 7 Feb 2020 11.47 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Fri 7 Feb 2020 11.34 EST\n\n, Will Boris Johnson please listen to his own father, rather than Jeremy Corbyn’s climate sceptic brother, on the subject of climate change? It may go against the prime minister’s instincts, but it is the best hope for Britain to live up to its responsibilities in a crucial year for our species., Johnson cannot do this on his own. That much was clear this week during the shambolic London launch of the COP 26 UN climate summit, which will take place in Glasgow in November. This will be the most important international conference in five years and as host the UK will play a leading role in deciding whether it ends in success or failure., The event was overshadowed by the sacking of the UK’s COP 26 president Claire O’Neill, who responded with a scathing takedown of a premier who she described as “not getting” climate change, failing to devote sufficient resources to summit preparations, and being fundamentally untrustworthy., The firing was not all bad news. O’Neill lacked the political heft and diplomatic skill needed to forge a global consensus on this most divisive of issues. If a more senior politician is appointed in her place, it would show the UK is taking preparations more seriously. The fact that the prime minister is fronting the launch demonstrates an investment of political capital that is commensurate with the challenge., He also said many of the right things, most concretely by confirming the UK’s commitment to go net-zero on carbon emissions by 2050. “Of course it’s expensive, of course it’s difficult, it will require thought and change and action, people will say it’s impossible and it can’t be done, and my message to you all this morning is that they are wrong,” he declared. “I hope it will be a defining year of action for our country, and indeed for our planet, on tackling climate change but also on protecting the natural world.”, But can he be trusted and can he deliver? On that question, almost all the evidence – from parliamentary voting records and donations from climate sceptics to his newspaper columns and performance as mayor – says no., Although Johnson has repeatedly called for reduced emissions, he scored zero out of 100 in the Guardian’s climate scorecards last year based on his rejection of actions that would achieve this in five key parliamentary votes. This includes opposition to onshore wind subsidies, emissions-based vehicle taxes and carbon capture and storage., He was also shown to have declared donations of £5,000 from Michael Hintze and £25,000 from Terence Mordaunt (via First Corporate Shipping), who fund the climate science sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation., The Conservative party says the Guardian cherry-picked votes and failed to recognise Johnson’s support for the net zero emissions target. The Guardian stands by its methodology, which can be read here., Other broader data sources confirm the prime minister’s woeful record on parliament. The parliamentary watchdog They Work for You notes that Johnson has “almost always voted against measures to prevent climate change” with one vote in favour, eight against and six absences (the latter largely due to his period as mayor of London)., The gulf between words and deeds was also evident when Johnson was foreign minister, when he oversaw a 60% cut in the UK’s team of climate attaches across the world from 165 to 65, just as the UK was supposed to be delivering the Paris agreement. He then tried to hush up what happened, according to the former chief scientist David King, who claimed Johnson also ignored his advice to be more publicly supportive of climate change and misled the public about King’s agreement to chair an inquiry into building an airport in the Thames estuary., While mayor of London, his record was mixed. On the positive side, he initiated a trial of fully electric buses, raised diesel charges, improved cycling networks and encouraged tree planting and zero-emission taxis. But he also held back a report on the impact of air pollution on deprived schools and curtailed a western extension of the congestion charge zone, which could have reduced traffic and improved air quality., His most famous green boast was that he would lie down in front of bulldozers to prevent a third runway being built at Heathrow airport. But was absent during the 2018 vote on this issue, and strongly supported his own pet airport project – a four-runway mega-terminal in the Thames estuary that never got off the ground., Johnson’s newspaper columns provide copious proof that he does not “get” climate change. In 2012, he described wind farms as “white satanic mills”, supported shale gas fracking and urged readers to “ignore doom merchants” who warn of the dangers of emissions., On three occasions, he blithely – and completely wrongly – claimed global heating was primarily caused by solar activity. “Whatever is happening to the weather at the moment, it is nothing to do with the conventional doctrine of climate change,” he wrote in 2015, citing the debunked claims of the climate sceptic Piers Corbyn – the brother of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. He was scoring points against a political opponent by dismissing the consensus view among scientists that the climate crisis is driven by human activity., The prime minister’s father, Stanley Johnson, is, by contrast, a committed environmentalist who has campaigned for faster action on climate change. At an Extinction Rebellion demonstration last year he declared himself proud to wear the badge of “non cooperative crusties”, which was the criticism levelled by his son at protesters. His influence is apparent in Boris Johnson’s endorsement of various wildlife campaigns, which he presents in colonial fashion as the fault of other nations. A quick glance at his backlist of articles reveals attacks on Japan for whaling, China for the slaughter of pangolins, and a belief that African elephants and cheetahs need to be saved by the UK., On the basis of his diplomatic clumsiness, poor grasp of science and voting record, Johnson appears to be the worst man for the job of making COP 26 a success. But, beyond his dad, there are two other reasons to hope that he might yet turn the pig’s ear of preparations into a silk purse of an event. If the democrat in him – and, perhaps more importantly in his adviser, Dominic Cummings – decides strong climate action is the will of the electorate (as polls overwhelmingly suggest), then he could demonstrate this by pushing it through with the same determination as Brexit. And if the patriot in him makes up his mind to make the UK a global leader in solving the greatest challenge of our age, then he will recognise the need to appoint a strong candidate to replace O’Neill., In this week’s speech, he alluded to this in an encouraging recognition of the UK’s responsibility to decarbonise. “I think it’s quite proper that we should, we were the first, after all, to industrialise. Look at historic emissions of the UK, we have a responsibility to our planet to lead in this way and to do this,” he said., Sadly it seems more likely, given his own history and his squabbles with Nicola Sturgeon over the hosting arrangements, that Johnson will put political partisanship first and bow to pressure from the US to downplay climate concerns in return for a trade deal, and from his donors and supporters to weaken EU environmental standards so the UK economy is more competitive after Brexit., Father will not approve. But Corbyn’s brother, at least, will have reason to smile., • This article was amended on 11 February 2020.

I mean, come on! The UK asked for this, they pitched for this responsibility, they must carry it forward.”, “This needs to be an overarching priority, that needs to come across. I do not see a coherent drive for the summit in the UK., “The UK’s handling of COP 26 has not become coherent enough for the UN even to be able to support them,” she added., Robinson, the former UN high commissioner for human rights who chairs the Elders group of former world statespeople, served twice as a UN climate envoy and campaigns for climate justice., Her exasperation reflects a growing disquiet among some leading international experts over the UK government’s leadership of the vital COP 26 summit, which remains without a figurehead after a tumultuous week., Last Friday, the former energy minister Claire O’Neill was abruptly sacked as president of the negotiations, the key role alongside the UN in bringing countries together to agree tougher limits on greenhouse gases. Since then, O’Neill has unleashed vitriolic attacks on Boris Johnson, alleging a lack of interest in the climate crisis, while Johnson’s failure to set out a clear vision of how the UK will get a deal at COP 26 has also been criticised., “It’s a huge pity this is happening,” said Yvo de Boer, the UN’s top climate official from 2006-2010, who began the push for climate action that resulted in the 2015 Paris agreement. “The president of the COP really needs to be the force for stability in this process. You need someone in place who is reaching out to key countries to smooth this process.”, The sacking of O’Neill reminded him of “a very bad time in my life”, he said, when during the Copenhagen COP in 2009 the Danish prime minister removed the serving COP president, Denmark’s environment minister Connie Hedegaard, and installed himself to lead the process. That was one of the factors that doomed the Copenhagen summit to an acrimonious and chaotic end., In this case, the sacking has happened sooner – meaning “this is not irreparable”, said de Boer. “But if it goes on, I think it will be damaging.”, Johnson must also do more to show the UK’s leadership in cutting emissions, beyond the promise to reach net zero by 2050, he said. “It’s very important that the UK has domestic policies in place that allow them to inspire confidence in other countries,” said de Boer., One long-time observer of COPs, who asked not to be named, said Johnson’s handling of the launch, at which he failed to set out clear stepping stones to a successful outcome for COP 26 or domestic policies to reduce emissions, had hurt his standing among world leaders on the issue. “There was nothing there, it was a mess,” they said. “It made me angry.”, However, there is still strong support for the UK’s COP 26 presidency and a willingness among many leading figures to assist Johnson and the government in building the coalition of countries needed. At COP 26, governments are being asked to come forward with tougher targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as the current targets are too weak to meet the goal of the Paris agreement in limiting global heating to 2C above pre-industrial levels., “COP 26 needs to send a signal, to give guidance to governments and businesses to encourage them to cut carbon,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and one of the most respected voices globally on climate issues. “I am sure that the UK will be a good manager of the COP.”, He said the UK had the diplomatic heft to forge the coalition of countries needed, even without a COP president currently. “I know the UK civil servants working on climate, they have top notch climate experts, some of the best in the world. I have full confidence in them.”, But he called for the government to show more urgency. “Building a team needs to happen immediately, and putting out a clear vision for COP 26. You need leadership, the engagement of all the key parties, including developing countries, and all other stakeholders including business and civil society.”, “The prime minister is really critical – his leadership will be very important to a successful outcome,” he added., Chile, which holds the current presidency of the UN climate process, also offered its support. Carolina Schmidt, who presided over last December’s Madrid climate talks, said: “Since the announcement that the UK will take on the presidency of COP 26, we have met representatives of the UK government on many occasions – including since the COP 25 meeting in Madrid. We look forward to continuing our close collaboration with the incoming COP 26 presidency, as well as other key partners, throughout 2020. This is a crucial year of climate action for humanity as a whole. We have a great challenge ahead: the climate crisis is a reality that all countries must tackle together, and we will stand firmly with our international partners to do so.”, Richard Kinley, former deputy head of the UN’s climate secretariat, said there was still time for the UK to recover. “Ideally, you would have started earlier, but politicians in the UK were preoccupied with Brexit,” he said. “It is late but it is not too late for things to begin, but a lot needs to be done fairly quickly to build momentum for these talks. You need to get mobilised.”, As well as the lack of a president, there is a widespread sense that the UK has got off to a slow start in the all-out diplomatic push that is needed to bring reluctant countries together. “The UK diplomatic machine really needs to be running at full speed now,” said de Boer. “They need to be going to other capitals, finding out the key sticking points, and what needs to happen to get a high level of ambition. That’s only going to happen if you understand what the red lines are for all parties.”, Some developing countries said they were awaiting more details from the UK, including the identity of the new president. “Without a doubt it would be good that sooner rather than later we will know who our primary interlocutor will be for COP 26,” said a representative of one key group of countries., Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, added: “Every day that the prime minister does not have a COP 26 president in place is valuable time being lost”mary robinson attacks unhelpful uk over cop 26 climate talks", "label": 0}, "train-250": {"text": "\nEU states clash over use of toxic mercury in light bulbs\n, Lighting industry’s exemption from 2011 ban may jeopardise climate goals, says Sweden, \nDaniel Boffey in Brussels, \n\nFri 7 Feb 2020 07.21 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2020 07.35 EST\n\n, A row over lamps is emerging as a first major test of the EU’s commitment to its much-vaunted European Green Deal and the bloc’s target of carbon neutrality by the middle of the century., A debate over the continued use of mercury in fluorescent lighting has split the 27 member states with Germany’s industrial interests being pitted against the environmental concerns of Sweden, according to leaked correspondence., The European commission is being asked by Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to continue to allow manufacturers to use mercury in light bulbs despite the potential damage to the environment and human health., The three main companies in the sector, General Electric, Philips and Osram, are major employers, particularly of German and Hungarian workers., But critics say that an exemption granted to the lighting industry in 2011 from a general ban on mercury use under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive is no longer justifiable., Sweden, Finland and Bulgaria, among others, say the successful argument nine years ago that there was not a readily available alternative to mercury in the manufacture of fluorescent lamps is defunct. Mercury-free LED light bulbs were said to produce significantly poorer levels of lighting, but it is now claimed that the technology has sufficiently moved on., Brussels’ next move is being billed as a test of its stated commitment to fighting the climate crisis., “Sweden’s main concern is that there are no legal grounds for renewing an exemption for the use in questions,” a letter from the Swedish government to the commission stated on 22 January. “Today there are economically viable substitutes available for most of the mercury-containing light sources.”, In 2017, the EU signed the Minamata convention obliging it to reduce the use of toxic materials such as mercury. The Swedish government argued in its letter that Brussels risked being in breach of its legal obligations., “Sweden also doubts that renewing the exemptions for mercury in question would be in line with the goal on climate neutrality and the ambitions on chemicals of the green deal recently launched by the commission”, its government added, citing the 40.9m metric tonnes of CO2 emissions savings that would be delivered by phasing mercury out by September 2021., The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in December that the premise of the so-called European Green Deal targeting a “climate-neutral continent” by 2050 was that the “old growth model that is based on fossil fuels and pollution is out of date”. She described it as Europe’s “man on the moon moment” as she laid out 50 policies to revamp EU rules and regulations.

By the time I reached the mill pond, fat raindrops had begun to fall, dimpling the surface of the water, which shimmered like hammered pewter. Two grey herons stood hunched on a partially submerged branch, while a third hunkered down on its tree-top nest. Along the far bank small rafts of teal and wigeon sought cover beneath the overhanging vegetation, but the weather appeared to have done little to dampen the spirits of the resident mallards, which had gathered en masse in an expanse of open water adjacent to the footpath., Mallards are the most numerous, widespread and confiding species of duck in the UK, so it’s easy to overlook them in favour of rarer or “wilder” waterfowl, but the amorous behaviour of the flock caught my eye. Mallards tend to establish pair bonds during October and November. But, irrespective of their status, males continue to participate in communal courtship displays throughout the winter. Though frequent, these displays are brief and lack the elaborate, ritualised posturing performed by other species., By focusing my attention on individual ducks, I began to pick up on their subtle gestures – head flicks, tail shakes and mock preening, where the bill is drawn along the underside of a partially raised wing. Groups of three to four drakes circled the hens, the males taking it in turns to whistle and flick an arc of water towards their chosen female, then rearing up to flash their chestnut-coloured breast – a behaviour known as grunt-whistling. Other males thrust back their iridescent emerald green heads, briefly raising their tails and wingtips, before paddling with outstretched necks, their heads hovering just above the water., With the sex ratio skewed towards males, the females could take their pick of the unpaired drakes. I watched one hen nod-swimming to elicit a response from her admirers. Heads pumping, two drakes steamed over to flank her. She immediately spun round and began to pursue one of her suitors across the pond. Snapping her bill at his curled black tail feathers, she delivered a volley of strident, staccato quacks, but whether this was a zealous show of selection or rejection, I couldn’t tell. country diary preening mallards gather to mate", "label": 0}, "train-252": {"text": "\nDo you have it in green?

In fact, they could be the crucial ingredients in the wardrobe of the future as growing numbers of designers try to create fashion that doesn’t harm the environment., Examine a garment’s care label and you may find that it was made out of pineapple stalks or cactus leaves, or a tote bag was woven with thread made from banana trees. From mushroom leather to algae T-shirts, the search is on for alternative materials with smaller carbon footprints. And the latest result are carbon-negative clothes made with algae that absorb carbon dioxide from the air., “Fashion is part of the problem but it’s also part of the solution,” said Nina Marenzi, founder and director of the Sustainable Angle, a not-for-profit organisation which promotes green textiles at its annual Future Fabric Expo. “We begin with materials and making them sustainable, and if fashion supply chains can change, then we start to address that.”, The New York designer Charlotte McCurdy has made a see-through bioplastic mac using algae – specifically algae powder used in vegan food products. She worked with glass casters to find a way to heat the algae and cool it in a controlled fashion to make it transparent. The material is carbon-negative because the algae draw carbon out of the atmosphere, meaning the coat acts as a carbon sink., “Follow the carbon – where did it come from?” she said. “Has it come from carbon taken out of the atmosphere millions of years ago and put in the ground? We talk a lot about what happens to materials after we use them, but not where they come from in the first place.”, Post Carbon Lab is using the same principle with another algae prototype – clothes that photosynthesise. The start-up in London has created photosynthesis coating, a layer of living algae on the fabric of garments that absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, turning the carbon into sugar. One large T-shirt – nearly a square metre of material – generates about as much oxygen as a six-year-old oak tree, according to the co-founder Dian-Jen Lin., The start-up has been working with designers and industry to translate its photosynthesis coating into a marketable product, and Lin said it could be used in shoes, backpacks, curtains, pillow cases, umbrellas and building canopies., The care instructions were rather different to normal clothes, she said. Wearing algae was not without its perils. “You can’t put it into your dark wardrobe. It needs light and carbon dioxide, so you have to put it in a well-ventilated area, like the back of your chair.” Washing machines would harm the algae, so “it’s handwash only – you have to be a bit careful. I wouldn’t recommend this coating for your underwear but maybe for a windbreaker or a jacket.”, Lin and her co-founder Hannes Hulstaert are testing the limits of the coating, which she says can be applied to almost any garments, either as a full coating or a print. “But it might change colour if it’s really upset, if it didn’t like the light or temperature,” Lin said. “Most of the organisms are in the green shade. In the healthy state they are dark brownish green, orangeish green. When it’s unhappy it might turn yellow, orange, brown, purple or white or transparent.”, However, it seems remarkably resilient. “We’ve had samples for three years which have come back to life,” Lin said., Other textiles include Piñatex, made from pineapple leaves and used by Hugo Boss and H&amp;M, and Mycotex, a substance grown from mushrooms. Cactus is the next plant-based leather to emerge, the creation of Desserto, a Mexican company that makes leather from leaves., The challenges facing the fashion industry in its quest to become greener are huge. The UK throws about 300,000 tonnes of clothes into landfill each year, and some studies suggest global textile production creates 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – more than airlines and shipping combined.fashion living garments suck carbon from air", "label": 0}, "train-253": {"text": "Fear in Mexico as twin deaths expose threat to monarch butterflies and their defenders, \nFear in Mexico as twin deaths expose threat to monarch butterflies and their defenders\n, The deaths of two butterfly conservationists have drawn focus to a troubling tangle of disputes, resentments and violence, by  David Agren in Ocampo and  Oliver Milman, \n\nSat 8 Feb 2020 10.19 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Sat 8 Feb 2020 03.00 EST\n\n, The annual migration of monarch butterflies from the US and Canada is one of the most resplendent sights in the natural world – a rippling orange-and-black wave containing millions of butterflies fluttering instinctively southward to escape the winter cold., The spectacle when they reach their destination in central Mexico is perhaps even more astonishing. Patches of alpine forest turn from green to orange as the monarchs roost in the fir trees, the sheer weight of butterflies causing branches to sag to the point of snapping. Tens of thousands of the insects bounce haphazardly overhead, searching replenishment from nearby plants., Monarch butterflies weigh just half a gram but are able to undertake an epic migration of up to 3,000 miles – a unique phenomenon in the insect world., A voracious eater, the monarch caterpillar can consume an entire milkweed leaf in less than five minutes. The species is entirely dependent upon milkweed for its propagation., The monarch’s bodies retain the toxins present in the milkweed, making them an unappetizing snack for birds., Scientists believe that monarchs navigate using the angle of the sun, setting off on their southward journey when the sun hits a certain point in the sky, no matter the stage of their journey., The species roosts in huge numbers in fir trees situated more than 3,000 metres above sea level in the forested volcanoes of central Mexico, having travelled from as far north as southern Canada., Monarchs are an important tourist drawcard for communities in and around the protected reserve in Mexico. The species has long had a cultural resonance, too – pottery unearthed from the era before Spanish conquest features depictions of the butterflies., To witness this sight is as if to enter a waking dream. “People have a spiritual and emotional connection to monarchs,” said Sonia Altizer, a monarch butterfly researcher at the University of Georgia. “Many people tell me that seeing them was a highlight of their life.”, The recent deaths of two butterfly conservationists in the region has, however, drawn attention to a troubling tangle of disputes, resentments and occasional bouts of harrowing violence that has lingered over the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, a sprawling world heritage site situated 60 miles north-west of Mexico City., En el Santuario El Rosario Ocampo Michoacan miles de Monarcas buscando agua .....El más grande del mundo pic.twitter.com/hXgAYk1Ztb, Mustachioed and gregarious, Homero Gómez González tirelessly promoted the El Rosario sanctuary, a section of the butterfly reserve that receives the bulk of tourists who come from around the world to see the monarchs. He featured in mesmerizing social media videos – posing with butterflies fluttering around him – and called the creatures “a marvel of nature”. Gómez, who was 50, disappeared on 13 January after attending a patron saint festival in the municipality of Ocampo; his body was found two weeks later at the bottom of a watering hole. His death has yet to be ruled a murder, although police say he suffered a blunt trauma to the head., The incident raised fears that gangs, possibly tied to the illegal logging of the butterfly reserve, had targeted Gómez for his advocacy of ecotourism over the felling of trees in this rugged swath of Mexico where communities, often beset by poverty, have traditionally relied upon the harvesting of timber, potatoes and wheat., Those concerns were further heightened this week after the death of a part-time tour guide from another nearby butterfly sanctuary, called Raúl Hernández Romero. His body was found 1 February with injuries possibly inflicted by a sharp object., “The panorama for the community, the forest and the monarch butterflies is now very complicated and uncertain,” Amado Gómez González, one of Gómez’s nine siblings, told the Guardian., “There are now these two crimes and it has spread fear. You find yourself thinking ‘What if this is a group that is coming to try and take the sanctuary away from us?”, Investigations into the two deaths are ongoing. But some conservationists fret they are a byproduct of the violence that has long troubled the state of Michoacán, which stretches from the mountains of central Mexico to the west coast., As they have done across the country, organized crime groups linked to the drug trade have diversified into many other activities, including kidnapping, avocado cultivation, land theft – and the lucrative market in pine, fir and cedar wood., Logging is supposedly under tight controls, but high prices mean lumber mafias often stray into protected areas – and are prepared to use violence. “In Michoacán, a tree is worth more than a human life,” said one former state official., “Homero Gómez was in conflict with these loggers,” said Homero Aridjis, an environmentalist and poet, who is a longtime defender of the monarch butterfly sanctuaries. “They’ve always been a very dangerous group because there are always politicians, businessmen involved in deforestation.”, Aridjis said his own activism against illegal logging, the planting of avocado orchards and the proposed construction of a mine near the sanctuaries has brought threats. He largely stays away from the butterfly sanctuaries due to security concerns., But others suggest Gómez may have fallen foul of a backlash to his buccaneering self-promotion and questions over his role as the former leader of the El Rosario community, which is run as an ejido – a traditional Mexican collectivist arrangement where residents share ownership of the land and its bounty., “In this system, it’s easy for a leader to become abusive with the community’s income,” said a Michoacán conservationist who was familiar with Gómez and the sanctuary but did not want to be named. The conservationist insisted it was still safe for butterfly guardians to do their work., “He was an outspoken person, he drew a lot of attention to himself. I don’t know why he was killed, but because of the non-transparent management of the ejido he had a lot of enemies. It’s difficult to say this in Mexico because the press has portrayed him nearly as a saint.”, Regardless, Amado Gómez’s fears that “large groups” might seize the sanctuary are not without foundation. Criminal groups have already moved in on resources such as water, forests and minerals – most famously in the indigenous Purépecha community of Cherán, where locals rose up in 2011 to halt illegal loggers, backed by a drug cartel, from clearcutting their forests., The demise of Gómez also highlights the misery suffered by Mexico’s beleaguered environmental defenders, who have been murdered with impunity in shocking numbers. Fourteen defenders were murdered in Mexico in 2018, according to Global Witness., Security concerns are rife in the region, and many prefer silence. “It’s very difficult to speak out, and even more so for those who live here,” said a local researcher, who preferred to remain anonymous., While the reasons for the deaths of the two men have yet to fully emerge, concerns are already swelling that the incidents will hurt tourism. The fragile security situation across Mexico has been blamed for a quiet winter for visitors in one of the major sanctuaries, Sierra Chincua, even before the deaths., The monarch butterflies themselves are also coming under growing pressures. A historic low in overwintering populations was recorded in 2013-14, amid a longer-term slump that has prompted mayors in cities across North America to promise remedial action. It’s suspected that butterfly numbers have been winnowed away by the use of toxic pesticides and razing of critical monarch habitat in the US and Canada., The decline was reversed somewhat last year but scientists warn the annual monarch migration faces an existential threat due to the climate crisis. The oyamel firs preferred by monarchs in Mexico are being stressed by rising temperatures and drought, with predictions the trees will be virtually wiped out by the end of the century., Global heating is also reducing the viability of milkweed, the sole plant where the monarch reproduces, in US and Canada. This trend is set to restrict the butterflies to isolated pockets and end their epic migration to Mexico, a journey that can stretch for 3,000 miles. A separate monarch migration, which brings butterflies to the warmth of coastal California, has shrunk from millions of insects in the 1980s to fewer than 30,000 individuals now., “It’s so obvious that it’s painful,” said Orley Taylor, a biologist and co-founder of Monarch Watch, a group of US volunteers focused on studying and conserving the species. “Within 30 years or so we probably won’t be talking about the monarch migration. We risk losing something very special indeed.”, The demise of the overwintering monarchs would send an economic and cultural shock through central Mexico, although there are currently more pressing concerns in a region beset by crime and few economic opportunities., “People are all for protecting the butterflies, but people have to have the necessities to survive,” said Father Martín Cruz Morales, a local priest, on a break from a community lunch of tacos and aguas frescas to celebrate the anniversary of a colleague’s ordination., In El Rosario this week, Gómez’s friends and family packed a billiards hall – emblazoned with the image of Homer Simpson – to pray the novena, or nine days of prayer., Over pastries and hot cups of fruit punch, Amado Gómez remembered his brother, a former logger, as an ambitious but often altruistic man, who graduated from Mexico’s premier agricultural university and mostly worked in government until launching his activism in favour of the monarch butterflies., Homero Gómez led tree-planting initiatives in El Rosario. He also helped organize patrols to protect the forests; teams of 10 persons still head out day and night into the hills to guard against incursions from illegal logging – something that locals say hasn’t occurred in the butterfly reserve for at least two years., “They know that people are organized here and know that it’s difficult to cut down a tree and escape,” Amado Gómez said. “Nobody trusts the local police so they do security themselves with sticks, with guns, with whatever they can use themselves.”, Altizer, the University of Georgia researcher stressed that she didn’t think the reserve was too dangerous to visit and argued that tourism and conservation efforts should continue as before., “El Rosario has so much to offer tourists, it’s right in the core of the biosphere reserve,” said Altizer. “If you think any place should be safe for monarchs and people it should be there, which makes this shocking. It makes me wonder if this will deter tourists from going there in the future. It sends a worrying message.”, She said scientists have long been advised to be cautious in the region, to not drive around at night and to avoid certain areas. A vehicle owned by the WWF had to cover its logo up on a previous visit due to fears of attack., “You see federal police patrolling the forest in military-style vehicles which is a little disconcerting,” she said., “There is drug cartel violence in Michoacán, and if that bleeds over into logging operations I don’t know what the best strategy to combat that is. People in these communities already have to deal with a lot of hardships. It’s difficult to promote ecotourism when logging continues even after the designation of the biosphere reserves.”monarch butterflies under threat mexico aoe", "label": 0}, "train-254": {"text": "\nWhy Finland leads the field when it comes to winter cycling\n, Progressive policies help get people on their bike, even in below-freezing conditions , \nPeter Walker, \n\nSat 8 Feb 2020 03.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2020 08.08 EST\n\n, In London, where I live, the idea of winter cycling generally involves little more than remembering some gloves and making sure your bike lights are charged. In Joensuu, the compact city in eastern Finland, where I am now, it’s arguably a more serious business., When I got off the train from Helsinki the temperature was -16C (3F), and hasn’t yet risen higher than -6C. Every roadway, pavement and cycle route is covered in a layer of compacted snow., Yet, one of the first things you see on the city’s streets are bikes. About 20% of all trips in Joensuu are cycled. This drops by about half in the depths of winter but that’s still far better than most Finnish cities, let alone almost anywhere in the UK., I’m in Joensuu because I was invited to come and see the Winter Cycling Congress, an annual gathering of researchers, academics and city officials, which is hosted by a different chilly municipality every year., After a couple of days of speaking to people here, two main lessons have emerged. Firstly, while winter cycling does bring its challenges, these are not always the ones you might expect. Secondly, and this is perhaps more predictable, if you want more people on bikes in winter, it’s less about individuals than infrastructure., In terms of the practicalities of riding on snow, Joensuu-like conditions of compacted snow are pretty easy. Almost everyone I’ve seen pedalling around this week has been using everyday bikes with ordinary tyres., Ari Varonen, the city’s chief roads engineer, told me that Joensuu’s bike routes are ploughed with the same tractors used for roads. They have a blade to push away fresh snow and add grooves to the surface to make it less slippery. The lanes are then gritted, rather than using bike-corroding salt., If the weather stays below freezing, all is fine. But as Matti Koistinen, head of the Finnish Cyclists’ Federation, explained to me, more varied temperatures are what cause the biggest problems., “If it’s really packed snow, like it is now, it’s comfortable to ride on. But when the temperature goes above 0C it becomes hell. It becomes very slushy, and then when it freezes again it’s pure ice, and really bouncy.”, At this point, the consensus seems, it is best to only venture out on a bike with tyres fitted with metal studs, given you can never be sure if a newly refrozen track has been freshly gritted., Joensuu has several advantages as a cycling city. It is relatively small, almost entirely flat, and its wide streets were mainly built in recent decades – as recently as the 1950s it only had a population of about 7,000., But it also has a comprehensive system of separated cycle routes, some just for bikes, others as part of a wide footway. This is particularly crucial, Varonen told me: “A bike lane just painted on the road wouldn’t work here in winter time. If you have packed snow, you can’t even see the marks. So no one would use it.”, Again, we come back to a perennial theme of the bike blog: if you want a lot of people to cycle, you need consistent political will to spend money on proper cycling facilities over the long term., That politicians in Joensuu are committed to cycling, and active transport more generally, is clear from the Winter Cycling Congress. The city’s mayor, Kari Karjalainen, not only greeted delegates at an opening reception but took his turn pedalling the static bike used to power the event’s PA system., There are good reasons for this. Joensuu has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2025, a target it will not manage without significantly reducing transport emissions, which make up 70% of the total., The Finnish government appears equally committed, with a funding programme in place for active travel as part of a target to increase walking and cycling by 30% by 2030. The country as a whole has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2030, 20 years before the UK’s deadline., While cycling groups in Britain are generally marginalised by the government, Koistinen sits as a representative of the cyclists’ federation on the official committee tasked with coming up with ways to reduce emissions., A pitfall of endlessly detailing forward-thinking policies in places such as Joensuu is that people in other countries can be tempted to shrug their shoulders and just assume, well, the Finns do things differently., And to an extent they do: North Karelia, the Finnish region of which Joensuu is the capital was the base for one of the earliest and best-known public health experiments in history, when 20 years of efforts led to a drop in historically high rates of heart disease, caused by rampant smoking and a diet largely based around animal fats, by about 80%., But you could take another lesson. The opening event of the Winter Cycling Congress took place at the city’s main school where, the teachers say, about half of pupils still ride to school in winter. On the morning in question, it was -13C and snowing. But the school’s bike racks were full., That’s perhaps something to think about next time you wonder whether you can face a bike ride in winter.why finland leads the field when it comes to winter cycling", "label": 0}, "train-255": {"text": "\nCountry diary: no peacock now struts Owain Glyndŵr’s land\n, Dyffryn Tanat, Powys: Little remains today of Sycharth, the Welsh hero’s courtly seat, razed by Prince Hal six centuries ago, \nJim Perrin, \n\nSat 8 Feb 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, Dawdling along the valley, low morning sun dazzling, shaded field-margins laced with frost, an impulse seized me at the Shropshire border to revisit Sycharth. Here’s one of the most revered, resonant places in Welsh history, where our national hero, warrior and statesman Owain Glyndŵr had his seat. His court bard, Iolo Goch, left a vivid portrait of his mansion and its courtly life in the last decade of the 14th century, just before the great insurrection Glyndŵr led against corrupt and insolent English rule., I’ve come here often over the past 50 years – for its associations, and for the inherent beauty of the place in its now-tranquil Marches valley. Goch’s description of Glyndŵr’s court enables you to visualise it as it was: the four marvellous pillars on a green Norman motte supporting a fine, moat-encircled, timbered house; the surrounding orchards, hayfields, vineyards, deer park, a mill, dovecotes, a rabbit warren, fishponds: “A’i dir bwrdd a’i adar byw, / Peunod, crehyrod hoywryw” (“His land a table where birds dwell, / Peacocks, high-stepping herons”)., An idyll – but a precarious one in treacherous times. In May 1403, with Glyndŵr away on his victorious progress through Wales, the 15-year-old Prince Hal – who became England’s Henry V – arrived here at the head of a strong force on a punitive foray from Chester. He razed the empty Sycharth, with its culture, opulence and hospitality., Come here in the summer and the landscape clearly attests to its fate. Fireweed still blooms across the bailey. Archaeological excavations revealed the smoke-blackened foundations of Glyndŵr’s great hall, in the shadow of mighty oaks that first took root on the motte at the time of its destruction. This understated shrine – a single sign, a tiny car park – to a crucial chapter in Welsh history reveals itself not through ruins but to the imagination’s eye., I watched as a descendant of one of those strutting herons stalked out into the marsh where the fishponds lay. Its ash-grey plumage against bare trees and winter-grey grass blended perfectly with this landscape’s mood. He speared down at nothing, as young Hal and his soldiers did six centuries ago; unlike them, he glided solemnly, harmlessly away.country diary no peacock now struts owain glyndwrs land", "label": 0}, "train-256": {"text": "\nThe endangered wolf that walked 8,712 miles to find love\n, Wolf known as OR-54 left home in Oregon in search of a mate, and scientists tracked her progress – until she died last week, \nKatharine Gammon in Los Angeles, \n\nSun 9 Feb 2020 06.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2020 11.09 EST\n\n, A young female gray wolf bid goodbye to her family, left home and crossed the state line into California to find love., That was in January 2018. For the next two years, the wolf known by scientists OR-54 wandered through mountains and pastures, occasionally killing livestock for food., Along the way, scientists tracked OR-54’s movements through a radio transmitter collar., Twice she went home to her parents in Oregon, perhaps complaining of the lack of dates. She even crossed the state line into Nevada last fall. All the while, she kept walking – an average of 13 miles each day – in search of a mate., Leaving home is a normal thing for a young wolf, says Amaroq Weiss, a biologist at the environmental not-for-profit Center for Biological Diversity. “When wolves get to one and a half or two years old, they are striking out from their birth pack, they are out there looking for mates and territory of their own,” says Weiss., Even within her family, this was a common thing: OR-54’s father, OR-7, had looked for a mate in California for years before returning to Oregon to have pups. Oregon’s wolves originated from the , OR-54’s story sadly came to a close this week when she was found dead in Shasta county. California’s fish and wildlife department is doing a necropsy to determine the cause of her death; she was only three years old. OR-54’s journey took her further south in California than any other wolf since 1924, when the species was extirpated., The death is just another instance that highlights the importance of legal protections for wolves, Wolves look for a partner by leaving urine markings and coming back to check them after a little while. “It’s pee-mail,” says Weiss. “But the fact that OR-54 never found a mate and settled down gives us info that there aren’t a lot of wolves in that area.”, Gray wolves, once abundant across the US, were almost completely eradicated by a concentrated effort by the government during the 19th and 20th century. While conservation work is being done to bring them back, their numbers remain low – California has documented about 20 wolves since 2011., In an area with a healthy gray wolf population, she would have been trying to pair up in December or January and would have been pregnant in February – Valentine’s Day actually has its origins in a celebration of wolf fertility, Weiss says. She should have been giving birth to a litter of pups in April. “She never found a mate in 2018, 2019, and now she’s not going to get to do it,” Weiss says. “Knowing what they’re after while they’re dispersing, you have this sense of an unfilled future.”, Her radio collar linked her with the death of livestock killed in areas she was passing through., Last fall, the battery on her collar began to die, and the transmissions became more scarce. The data that did come in showed her collar in one spot this winter, not moving. Wildlife officials traced her to the spot, and found her carcass., The investigation is continuing, so the cause of OR-54’s death is not yet known. Weiss says that the life of a wolf is a rough one – in a pack or solo – and there are many reasons a young, healthy wolf could die. She could have been kicked in the head by a deer while hunting. She could have choked on the liver of a raccoon, which happened to a wolf in Yellowstone. She could have been hit by a car. Or she could have been killed by a poacher., It wouldn’t be the first time. Another Oregon wolf in California, OR-59, was found dead in suspicious circumstances in December 2018. The wolf was shot near the small communities of Lookout and Bieber, the wildlife agency said. Just last month, officials announced a $2,500 federal award for any information on the wolf’s death., Gray wolves are covered under both the Federal Endangered Species Act, as well as the California Endangered Species Act, the fish and wildlife department says. “We take very seriously any threats to this recovering wolf population. We are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding OR-54’s death. We remind the public that killing a wolf is a potential crime and subject to serious penalties including imprisonment.”, Weiss says it’s likely that wolves will continue to push south into territory they haven’t experienced since the early part of the 20th century. “We can expect to see more of this in the future as long as there is a good source population in Oregon,” she says., Weiss adds that this wolf’s death is just another instance that highlights the importance of legal protections for wolves, especially early in their recovery. “Laws may not stop people, but if they are caught, they face real penalties,” she says. “No matter what you think of wolves, poaching is just wrong.”, • This article was amended on 10 February 2020.

In his hands were an axe, a small scythe and a large crop of grass. Like many of the Gond people living in India’s Hasdeo Arand forest, he will use the grass to make ropes, brooms and mats., The Hasdeo Arand is one of the largest contiguous stretches of dense forest in central India, covering about 170,000 hectares (420,080 acres) of the state of Chhattisgarh. It is rich in biodiversity, contains many threatened species and is home to elephants, leopards and sloth bears., It is also home to the Gond, one of India’s Adivasis, the name given to the country’s original indigenous peoples. Unfortunately for Porte, the Gond and other Adivasis forest dwellers, the Hasdeo Arand sits on top of more than a billion metric tonnes of coal reserves., Porte and his neighbours in the village of Ghatbarra are currently fighting a rearguard action against the mining giant Adani to protect their ancestral homelands and one of the sub-continent’s richest and most diverse regions. “If the coal mining comes we will lose everything,” he says., Despite at one time being declared offlimits to mining, a new government in 2011 granted mining permission for the first coal blocks in Hasdeo Arand. By 2013 the Parsa East and Kante Basan open cast mine operated by Adani – and which adjoins Porte’s village – was a reality. It currently produces 15m tons of coal per annum., Now more open cast mines have been approved by the government of Narenda Modi. An estimated 80% of the entire forest area – and 30 villages – may be lost, according to Bipasha Paul, programme officer for Chhattisgarh-based NGO Janabhivyakti, which is working with the Hasdeo Arand residents., To the Gond every feature of the forest has a spiritual significance and they rely on products collected there to sustain life: flowers, fruits, grains, seeds, tubers and roots for food and medicines; timber, leaves and grasses for ropes, mats, brooms, baskets, fires and building., One-time compensation for the land is not enough – we need much more than money to survive. We need nature to be with us, Fearing their way of life is threatened by these mines, the Gond are fighting to stop them. Adani is one of India’s largest and most influential companies, run by the country’s second richest man, Gautam Adani, said by Forbes to be worth $15.7bn. The Adani group itself has an annual revenue of $13bn and is currently making the headlines in Australia where environmentalists and residents are fighting plans for the Carmichael mine in Queensland., In India, a new mine – the Parsa open cast mine operated by Adani Enterprises through its subsidiary Rajasthan Collieries – has recently received approval and will cover over 841 hectares of the forest next to the Parsa East and Kante Basan. According to Adani, the new mine has a mineable reserve of 200m metric tons of coal and a lifespan of 42 years., Last October, residents from 20 nearby villages set up a large tent in Fathepur village as a centre for their protests. Men, women and children gathered to argue that their village councils had never given permission for mining on their homelands – a right they say is enshrined in law. The protesters submitted a letter to Chhattisgarh state government authorities on October 21 demanding that land acquisition and clearance for mining be rescinded on that basis. Adani says that as these lands are “coal bearing”, permission was not needed., On the wall of Janabhivyakti’s tiny local office hangs a large map of the Hasdeo Arand forest marked with the coal mines already operating and those soon to commence. There isn’t much room left on the map. Thirty surveyed open cut mine sites are due to go online in the Hasdeo Arand forest in the future., Bipasha Paul argues that the local Adivasis peoples will not be the only ones to suffer. The proposed mines and an associated 75km coal rail line impact elephant habitat and inhibit migration routes in the forest. There are already a growing number of reports of incidences of human-elephant conflict as the elephants’ habitat diminishes., It is hard to see how the mines will not adversely affect elephants and other native wildlife. The Hasdeo Arand is home to 34 species of mammals, 14 species of reptiles, 111 species of birds and 29 species of fish; these live among the 86 species of trees, the 51 species of medicinal plants, 19 species of herbs and 12 species of grass., But a plan for a proposed elephant reserve in a small remaining unmined area of the Hasdeo Arand forest will mean villagers will be forced to leave there too., The government has promised compensation and resettlement to those Adivasis impacted by the mines and forced to leave their forest homes, but most indigenous residents know nothing of life outside the Hasdeo Arand. Many fear they will be forced to join the exodus to the suburbs and slums of India’s vast metropolises., Adani argues that it is helping the community, rather than hindering it. “While achieving energy security for India remains our larger goal, the project has begun touching millions of lives. From employing more than 400 tribals sic at Parsa East and Kanta Basan we have been working closely to improve education and healthcare facilities in India’s hinterlands,” the company says on its website., But Bhual Singh, who was chopping wood collected from the forest outside Ghatbarra village, failed to see the upside. “Mining will be our death,” he said., “It is going to devastate everything nature has given us. One-time compensation for the land is not enough – we need much more than money to survive.

The 20-year-old, who now lives in London, grew up in Queensland, Australia, cheekbyjowl with the country’s wildlife, fishing frogs out of the toilet and dodging snakes hanging from the ceiling., The bushfires ravaging her homeland over the past few weeks have taken their toll. “I’ve found myself bursting into tears … just seeing the absolutely harrowing images of what’s happening in Australia – it is overwhelming and terrifying.”, Hogan said her lowest point came when she heard about the death of half a billion animals incinerated as the fires swept through the bush. “That was the moment where I felt my heart cleave into two pieces. I felt absolutely distraught.”, The physical impact of the climate crisis is impossible to ignore, but experts are becoming increasingly concerned about another, less obvious consequence of the escalating emergency – the strain it is putting on people’s mental wellbeing, especially the young., Psychologists warn that the impact can be debilitating for the growing number of people overwhelmed by the scientific reality of ecological breakdown and for those who have lived through traumatic climate events, often on the climate frontline in the global south.., Until two years ago Dr Patrick Kennedy-Williams, a clinical psychologist from Oxford, had spent his career treating common mental health difficulties including anxiety, depression and trauma. Then something new started to happen. Climate scientists and researchers working in Oxford began to approach him asking for help., “These were people who were essentially facing a barrage of negative information and downward trends in their work … and the more they engaged with the issue, the more they realised what needed to be done – and the more they felt that was bigger than their capacity to enact meaningful change,” he said. “The consequences of this can be pretty dire – anxiety, burnout and a sort of professional paralysis.”, Kennedy-Williams began to research the topic and realised it was not just scientists and researchers who were suffering. “There is a huge need among parents, for instance, who are asking for support on how to talk to their kids about this.”, When Kennedy-Williams began focusing on young people he assumed most would be older teenagers or at least have started secondary school. But he soon discovered worrying levels of environment-related stress and anxiety in much younger children., “What I was most surprised by is how young the awareness and anxiety starts. My own daughter was just six when she came to me and said: ‘Daddy, are we winning the war against climate change?’ and I was just flummoxed by that question in the moment. It really showed me the importance as a parent of being prepared for the conversation, so we can respond in a helpful way.”, He says there is no way to completely shield young people from the reality of the climate crisis, and argues that would be counterproductive even if it were possible. Rather, parents should talk to their children about their concerns and help them feel empowered to take action – however small – that can make a difference., A key moment for Kennedy-Williams came with the realisation that tackling “climate anxiety” and tackling the climate crisis were intrinsically linked., “The positive thing from our perspective as psychologists is that we soon realised the cure to climate anxiety is the same as the cure for climate change – action. It is about getting out and doing something that helps., “Record and celebrate the changes you make. Nobody is too small. Make connections with other people and at the same time realise that you are not going to cure this problem on your own. This isn’t all on you and it’s not sustainable to be working on solving climate change 24/7.”, This certainly resonates with Hogan, who has set up Force of Nature, an initiative aimed at helping young people realise their potential to create change., Hogan’s group aims to target people aged 11-24 with a crash course in the climate crisis that helps them navigate their anxiety and realise their potential to get involved, take action and make a stand., “This is only the beginning,” said Hogan. “We’re going to see massive, massive widespread climate crisis in every country around the world, so it’s about developing the emotional resilience to carry on, but in a way that ignites really dramatic individual initiative.”, Beyond climate anxiety – the fear that the current system is pushing the Earth beyond its ecological limits – experts are also warning of a sharp rise in trauma caused by the experience of climate-related disasters., In the global south, increasingly intense storms, wildfires, droughts and heatwaves have left their mark not just physically but also on the mental wellbeing of millions of people., For Elizabeth Wathuti, a climate activist from Kenya, her experience of climate anxiety is not so much about the future but what is happening now. “People in African countries experience eco-anxiety differently because climate change for us is about the impacts that we are already experiencing now and the possibilities of the situation getting worse,” she said., She works with young people through the Green Generation Initiative she founded and sees the effects of eco-anxiety first-hand. A common worry she hears among students is: “We won’t die of old age, we’ll die from climate change.”, Extreme climate events can create poverty, which exacerbates mental health problems, and Wathuti says she has seen stress, depression and alcohol and drug abuse as some of the side-effects of climate anxiety and trauma in her country. , Even in the UK, a recent study by the Environment Agency found that people who experience extreme weather such as storms or flooding are 50% more likely to suffer from mental health problems, including stress and depression, for years afterwards., More than 1,000 clinical psychologists have signed an open letter highlighting the impact of the crisis on people’s wellbeing and predicting “acute trauma on a global scale in response to extreme weather events, forced migration and conflict”., Kaaren Knight, a clinical psychologist who coordinated the letter, said: “The physical impacts related to extreme weather, food shortages and conflict are intertwined with the additional burden of mental health impacts and it is these psychologists are particularly concerned about.” , She added that fear and trauma “significantly reduced psychological wellbeing”, particularly in children. “This is of huge concern to us and needs to be part of the conversation when we talk about climate breakdown.”, One of the high-profile signatories of the letter, Prof Mike Wang, the chair of the Association of Clinical Psychologists UK, said: “Inaction and complacency are the privileges of yesterday … Psychologists are ready and willing to help countries protect the health and wellbeing of their citizens given the inevitable social and psychological consequences of climate change.”, This rallying of the psychological profession around the climate crisis has led to experts around the world forming groups to research and treat the growing number of people caught up in the unfolding crisis, attempting to help them move from fear and paralysis towards action., But even for those who are following this advice, the scale of the emergency is taking its toll. Kennedy Williams – who has set up his own group, Climate Psychologists, specialising in climate anxiety – said he and his colleagues were not immune from the psychological impacts of the crisis., “This is such a universal thing that we have all been through our own set of climate-related grief and despair, and we talk about riding the wave between hope and despair … it is absolutely as real for us as it is for anyone else.”, Remember that you do not need to be a climate expert It’s OK to explore learning together. If your child asks a question you can’t answer immediately, respond by saying: “What a great question. Let me look into that so I can answer it properly.”, Try to validate, rather than minimise, children’s emotions If children express anxiety, it’s much better to say: “It’s OK to feel worried. Here is what we can do about it,” than to say: “Don’t worry. It’s all fine.” But always try to support this emotion with suggestions for positive action., Negative information hits harder Bad or threatening facts tend to resonate more strongly – and therefore stick in the mind. So try to balance one piece of negative news with three pieces of positive news. Have some examples of good climate-related news ready – for example, successful conservation projects., For younger children, keep it local and tangible Suggest litter picks and school events. For teenagers, encourage them to stay connected at a wider level – help them write to their MP, take part in protests and join local communities and campaigns., Set practical goals as a family and follow through Record and celebrate your climate successes together (even a piece of paper on the fridge door). Reinforce the message that small actions can make a big difference.overwhelming and terrifying impact of climate crisis on mental health", "label": 0}, "train-260": {"text": "\nFires and floods: maps of Europe predict scale of climate catastrophe\n, Without urgent action, rising sea levels by end of century could leave cities under water, \nJennifer Rankin in Brussels, \n\nMon 10 Feb 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2020 06.12 EST\n\n, A series of detailed maps have laid bare the scale of possible forest fires, floods, droughts and deluges that Europe could face by the end of the century without urgent action to adapt to and confront global heating., An average one-metre rise in sea levels by the end of the century – without any flood prevention action – would mean 90% of the surface of Hull would be under water, according to the European Environment Agency., English cities including Norwich, Margate, Southend-on-Sea, Runcorn and Blackpool could also experience flooding covering more than 40% of the urban area., Across the North Sea, Dutch cities including the Hague, Rotterdam and Leiden were predicted to face severe floods from an average one metre sea-level rise, which is forecast if emissions rise 4C–6C above pre-industrial levels., The model does not account for the Netherlands’ extensive flood-prevention measures, although many other countries have not taken such action., Meanwhile, large areas of Spain, Portugal and France would be grappling with desertification, with the worst-affected zones experiencing a two and half-fold increase in droughts under the worst-case scenario., Hotter summers increase the risk of forest fires, which hit record levels in Sweden in 2018. If emissions exceed 4C, France, southern Germany, the Balkans and the Arctic Circle could experience a greatly increased fire risk. However, the absolute fire danger would remain highest in southern European countries, which are already prone to blazes., Further north, winters are becoming wetter. Failure to limit global heating below 2C could mean a swath of central and eastern Europe, from Bratislava in the west to Yaroslavl in the east, will be in line for sharp increase in “heavy rain events” during autumn and winter by the end of the century., In some areas of central and eastern Europe there is predicted to be a 35% increase in heavy rain events, meaning torrential downpours would be more frequent., While the climate data has been published before, this is the first time the EU-agency has presented it using detailed maps on one site. Users can zoom in on small areas, for example, to discover that one-third of the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham could be exposed to flooding by 2071., The Copenhagen-based agency hopes the maps will reach decision-makers in governments and EU institutions, who would not usually read a lengthy EEA report on the impact of the climate emergency., “It’s very urgent and we need to act now,” said Blaž Kurnik, an EEA expert in climate change impacts and adaptation., Even if countries succeed in restricting global temperature rise, existing CO2 in the atmosphere would still have an impact, he said., “The number of extreme events and sea level rise will still continue to increase for the next decades to a century,” Kurnik said. “Sea level rise, especially, can be problematic, because it is still increasing because of past emissions and the current concentration of greenhouse gases.”, The agency wants governments to focus on adapting to unavoidable global heating. “Adaptation is crucial in the next decades of the century. Even if we are able to increase the temperature by 2C, adaptation is crucial for the next decades.”, The EEA has concluded it is possible to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2C above pre-industrial levels, as long as greenhouse gas concentrations peak during the next 15 to 29 years., Meeting a more demanding 1.5C limit requires concentrations to peak in the next three to 13 years. Under both scenarios, there is a 50% chance of overshooting the temperature., • This article was amended on 10 February 2020. An earlier version said that the EEA concluded “it is possible to keep global temperatures 2C below pre-industrial levels, as long as emissions peak during the next 15 to 29 years”. That meant to say greenhouse gas concentrations, not emissions; and the 2C referred to a rise in temperature above pre-industrial levels, not the temperature below pre-industrial levels.

Ivy had snaked up the back of the tree to join it, green on green., The other two trunks had been lopped off to stumps a metre high, presenting a V-sign to the sky. Out of their gnarly sides a dozen thick sprays of twigs had spurted forth. They were greenish yellow, shiny and slippery like nylon washing-line. My wife grasped at a bundle of stems, running her basket-weaving fingers down their length, feeling for springy suppleness. “You could work these,” she said., February had woken the youthful sprigs. One spray showed the merest bumps of buds. On the lowest spray, two precocious twigs, partly touching each other, had already unfurled their lanceolate leaves.

The sounds come from a flock of our smallest duck, the teal., The collective noun for teal is “spring”, and they do always seem to be spring-loaded and ready to fly. No matter how carefully my dog and I sneak past, they usually notice us, taking to the air in a flurry, before dropping down in the distance, well out of sight. To get closer to this delicate little duck, I headed south to the RSPB reserve at Greylake in Somerset., Once inside the roomy hide, I set up my scope and took a proper look. The drake teal’s plumage is far more subtle and complex than it first appears. Black wiggles across his breast, known as “vermiculations”, from the Latin for worm; a creamy-yellow slash along his flanks; and the bluish-green eyepatch: teal being the only colour believed to be named after a British bird., He was resting on one leg, opening and shutting pale eyelids, as the rain splashed off his plumage like water off a waxed jacket.

I want a broad range of events to help ensure that everyone feels they have a part to play in this,” Scotland’s first minister said at a conference in London. “That’s the kind of movement we need to create around this, that can be a hugely powerful voice for change.”, At last December’s climate talks in Madrid, protests outside the halls – including a 500,000-strong march led by Greta Thunberg – were in stark contrast to the acrimony and stalling inside as governments failed to produce hoped-for progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions., “We really should be thinking how we can have civil society much more embedded in the negotiations and discussions and affect the outcome,” Sturgeon said. “I don’t know structurally how that will happen, but it is something we should push forward.”, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister hotly tipped for the post of president of COP26, said he wanted the summit to be “the most transparent ever”, promising to livestream as much of the talks as possible online., He said political leaders saying one thing in public and another in private had been one of the problems with the annual climate talks in the past., Gove appeared to set a low bar for measuring success at the talks, saying it was for countries to “accept the need to change and that leads to irreversible, accelerating and inclusive action” on the climate crisis., That falls well short of requiring governments to come forward with concrete new plans on cutting carbon in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement, which is what activists and some other countries are hoping for., Gove pledged that the government would bring forward a series of measures in the next few months aimed at fleshing out the UK’s commitment to net zero emissions before the COP26 conference. , Gove is seen as one of the frontrunners to be president of the conference after a week of government confusion in which David Cameron and William Hague turned down the post. , No announcement is expected on who will take the presidency until a cabinet reshuffle that is expected on Thursday at the earliest. That will be almost two weeks since the previous COP president, the former energy minister Claire O’Neill, was sacked., Climate experts have expressed growing disquiet about the disrupted start to the UK’s presidency of the talks, warning that time is running out for the government to present a coherent vision of how it will steer the conference. COP26 is regarded by many as one of the last realistic chances to put the world on track to meet the Paris goal of holding global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the impacts of global heating are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible., Climate campaigners are concerned that the UK has got off to a slow start both in its hosting of the conference and in its own actions to reach the target of net zero emissions by 2050, enshrined in law under Theresa May’s government last summer., John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, told the Guardian: “Michael Gove is not usually a man lost for words, given he is perhaps the best debater in government. But this morning he was surprisingly coy about what he wanted to see the Glasgow summit achieve, or even what he thought the most important thing the UK government could do in the face of a climate emergency., “While he did take a dig at Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and US president Donald Trump, he failed to put any meat on the bones of UK action required. With the clock ticking, the climate summit is not far away. As Gove accepted, we caused the problem – now we need to lead the way out. But that needs strong, determined action to deal with both the climate and nature crisis we are facing.”, Dustin Benton, a policy director at Green Alliance, which hosted Gove’s speech, said: “The UK has to be itself on track to meet its own emissions targets.

More than three years on, people are establishing a ‘new normal’, but frail older people, children, people living alone or already dealing with traumatic or stressful life events, remain especially vulnerable.”, In the report, commissioned by the Centre of Expertise for Waters (Crew), residents describe the lasting impact of flooding on both their physical and mental health. As well as persistent coughs and throat infections, residents also reported weight loss, high blood pressure, insomnia, and heavy drinking, which they directly attributed to their experience of flooding., Most commonly, women told researchers that they had very low energy levels after the flood, which they felt compromised their ability to deal with stressful issues. One interviewee described how she had to prioritise “self-preservation” over dealing with stressful matters such as shopping around for alternative home insurance cover., Others spoke of the stress and anxiety triggered by bad weather, with one resident warning: “Ballater isn’t back to normal, it’s not going to be back to normal for a couple of years. In actual fact the whole community is suffering from post-traumatic stress.”, A parent reported that her young daughter now worried about other potential natural dangers like landslides, while another resident described “obsessively” checking the local river level on the Sepa (Scottish Environmental Protection agency) website, even two years after being flooded, saying: “It does make me very anxious when it rains and I do, obsessively, two or three times a day check the Sepa data to see how high the river is.”, The study also highlights the considerable impact on household finances, with many participants reporting that they no longer had a “financial cushion” having used up savings to cover flood-related costs. These costs were directly linked to the length of time that some people were out of their homes: time spent in temporary accommodation was often much longer than expected and accrued extra costs like having to travel regularly back to their home to supervised renovation work; being more reliant on prepared foods or takeaways because they had limited cooking facilities., It seems that every part of the recovery process threw up challenges. As Philip explains: “Some people chose not to replace all the belongings they had lost because the thought of possibly losing all their possessions again was too raw. Others, homeowners and those who owned commercial property, were hit with significant increases in insurance premiums, which for some was unaffordable.”, Expectations of friends and family could also prove difficult as the months and years went on. Currie says: “There was a perception that once you had returned home after renovation work was completed you were ‘over’ the flooding, but many of our interviewees were still recovering from their experiences up to 40 months after the flooding. Many friends and family stopped asking how people were once a year or so had passed – some participants welcomed this as they didn’t always want to talk about their experiences, but others felt it was a sign that others thought they should have moved on.”, The study also found that even people who hadn’t been flooded experienced “a sort of survivor guilt”: with so many homes and businesses being directly affected, everybody knew someone who had been flooded and everyone experienced the wider disruption to transport and services., The case study areas were chosen for contrast, because Ballater had been flooded in 2015-16 for the first time in living memory, while Garioch been flooded more frequently. While the expectation was that Garioch would respond more resiliently, the report found that, because Ballater was a more closely knit community, local people were better able to mobilise their response effort., Currie said: “We wondered if the community spirit would dwindle three-plus years on but, overall, we found a strong sense of the community holding together in both areas. Both have got their community centres kitted out with generators and equipment, which makes them better prepared to deal with any future emergency situation.”, Participants and researchers have also produced a checklist of five steps that every household at risk of flooding should implement:, 1. Have a home emergency plan in place, which would include what to do in a flood and other scenarios such as a fire., 2. Check that home insurance includes flood cover, and make sure that any changes to the T&amp;Cs in the future do not change the type of cover you think you have., 3. Sign up to receive Floodline alerts – the service is free and messages can be received in different formats (by phone, SMS)., 4. If Sepa (or bodies such as the Environment Agency in other parts of the UK) make river level data for a water body near where you live publicly available use this resource., 5. Make use of publicly available resources such as Sepa’s flood risk maps to find out if a property you are considering buying is at risk of flooding.scottish study reveals significant long term impact of flooding", "label": 0}, "train-267": {"text": "\nPacific lamprey project in peril after floods wash away hundreds of fish\n, At least 250 unaccounted for after heavy rainfall across Pacific north-west overwhelmed cage of fish waiting to be released, \nNina Lakhani, \n\nTue 11 Feb 2020 10.27 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2020 12.30 EST\n\n, A pioneering tribal biodiversity project to restore the sacred Pacific lamprey population has been dealt a major blow after huge floods washed away hundreds of fish before they could be released into the wild., The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) have spent two decades reintroducing the lamprey into tributaries of the Columbia River after US government dams and industrial fishing wiped out the endemic species., The Pacific lamprey – a jawless fish that looks like an eel – is considered a “first food” by the Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla tribes, which make up the confederation, as it was a key element of their ancestors’ diet., The seven gill ports on each side of the lamprey are tied to the seven drums and seven generations considered sacred to the tribes., Last week, high temperatures and heavy rainfall caused havoc and evacuations across the Pacific north-west as levees burst and rivers flooded., The 500,000-acre Umatilla reservation, located about 220 miles east of Portland, Oregon, was inundated last Thursday after sudden unseasonably hot weather caused large quantities of snow on the Blue Mountains to rapidly melt. The climate crisis is causing increased flooding in many areas as the planet warms and disrupts weather patterns., The water gained force as it ran into the Umatilla River, where about a thousand adult lamprey were enclosed in tanks within a caged acclimatization facility, waiting to be released into the nearby Grande Ronde River., The force of the river overwhelmed the cage, and the tanks were sent floating downstream, according to Aaron Jackson, director of the lamprey project for the Umatilla tribes fisheries’ programme., Several tanks were found with their doors open, which means the fish escaped. The fish were yet to be genetically marked, so the tribe has no way of tracking them., Two other tanks have since been located several miles downstream; 20 stressed but living fish were found in one, 34 in another. The rest were dead. At least 250 fish and two tanks are still unaccounted for., “We’ve lost the entire 2020 allocation for the Grande Ronde River, as even those we found alive were so stressed, we put them into the Umatilla straight away,” said Jackson., “But the fact that any survived … its times like these that the lamprey shows us how strong they are.”, The Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla tribes have lived in the area now known as northeastern Oregon and south-eastern Washington for more than 10,000 years, moving around to fish, hunt and gather food from the Columbia River basin and the Blue Mountains. The tribes were forced onto the Umatilla reservation upon signing the 1855 treaty, after which the federal government appropriated increasing swathes of land and waterways for industry and settlers., In the late 1960s and early 70s, a state industrial fishing programme poisoned the Umatilla River and wiped out endemic species including the lamprey, which washed up dead along the bank., In 2000, the restoration project began relocating adult fish from another area to the Umatilla River.

Children with clinically low lung function will have reduced exercise capacity.”, At the launch of the report on Tuesday morning, Mark Bergin, a PE teacher from Manorfield primary school in Poplar, east London, said: “There are elements that we can see now because there is such an increase in the number of children who have asthma pumps; I’ve noticed that over the last 10 years or so of working in education.”, To produce the report, campaign group The Air Team spoke with senior respiratory consultants, as well as leaders in physical education, to assess the effects of air pollution on children’s lung function and sporting ability., They also assessed air pollution at 94 sports sites in England and found that 25 broke WHO recommended limits, while 52 came close to the threshold., Perry Park was the third most polluted of the sites across London, Birmingham, Nottingham, Salford and Sheffield, with an annual mean level of 50 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) a cubic metre of air (μg/m3) – the WHO recommends a safe level of 40μg/m3., The training grounds of Ridgeway Rovers, where David Beckham and Harry Kane formerly played, and Alpha &amp; Omega FC, Raheem Sterling’s former youth team, have fine particulate matter levels (PM2.5) of 11, above WHO recommended limits., St Augustine’s Hall, home of the Victoria Park Harriers and Tower Hamlets athletics club, had the highest air pollution levels out of those assessed, with 67 NO2 μg/m3., Ben Paul, an Air Team campaigner who lives in Bloomsbury, central London with his 10-year-old son, said: “It’s like how it took time for the full health impacts of smoking to be understood. I think this could be a ticking time bomb for our children., “Kids’ lung capacity can reduce by up to 14% if they live in a high pollution area. Wouldn’t it be great if we could get 14% more medals at the next Olympics?”, The Air Team is calling on sports organisations, MPs, schools and athletes to back their Breathe GB campaign.

As he began by talking about “acceptance of the needs to act”, an audience member shouted that acceptance had been reached 20 years ago, and what was needed was action., Gove continued: “Acceptance of the needs to act leads to action that is irreversible, accelerating and increasing.”michael gove criticises us brazil climate crisis scepticism cop 26", "label": 0}, "train-271": {"text": "\n'We have nothing to keep the sea out': the struggle to save Spain's Ebro Delta\n, After Storm Gloria devastated one of the Mediterranean’s largest wetlands, an urgent search has begun for solutions to protect it from further floods and creeping water levels, \nStephen Burgen in Barcelona, \n\nTue 11 Feb 2020 04.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2020 04.02 EST\n\n, A month after Storm Gloria battered the east coast of Spain, the extent of the devastation to the Ebro Delta is only now becoming clear. Those whose livelihoods depend on the region are demanding solutions amid fears that rising seas will further threaten the fragile ecosystems of the Mediterranean’s most important wetland., Storm Gloria brought rain, snow and flooding to most of Spain, but it was the east coast that was hardest hit, with high winds whipping the normally placid Mediterranean with such ferocity that plastic containers of products that haven’t been on the market in decades washed up on Catalan beaches., The low-lying Ebro Delta suffered most, as the storm sent waves crashing nearly 30 metres inland, inundating rice fields and irrigation channels with saltwater as far as 3km (2 miles) from the shore., Mussel and oyster farms were badly damaged, while pumping stations essential for maintaining the balance between fresh and saltwater were destroyed. Houses in the town of Deltebre were flooded., “You can just imagine the impact of waves as high as nine metres and winds up to 100km per hour hitting a region that is at sea level,” says Gerardo Bonet, president of the Ebro Delta mussel farmers’ association, who estimates the association’s losses at around €1.6 million (£1.3 million). “No one has ever seen a storm like this here.”, The delta produces 4,000 tonnes of mussels and 800 tonnes of oysters a year but 11 of the platforms used to grow the creatures have been destroyed and many others damaged. “We have to replace and reinforce the structures and also make them higher, because the sea level has risen as a result of climate change,” Bonet says., Around 15% of the 700,000 tonnes of rice grown in Spain comes from the delta and more than 7,000 acres of rice fields will have to be desalinated and flooded with freshwater before planting can begin in April. Even then, it’s estimated that around 20% of the crop will be lost., According to rice farmer Raül Arqués, the real danger is another storm coming before they can rebuild what Gloria washed away. “At the moment we have no defences, nothing to keep the sea out.”, While Gloria represents the sharp end of the threat from the climate crisis, for decades the delta’s fragile ecology has suffered from a combination of political neglect and over-exploitation of the river. The Ebro, which gave Iberia its name, is the only major Spanish river that flows into the Mediterranean. Its waters are much in demand for irrigation and hydro-electricity and there are 181 dams along its 930km course from Cantabria to the sea., As Bonet puts it, “the delta is a balance between the river and the sea and for some time now the sea has been winning”., He says the river’s flow into the delta has fallen by half since the 1990s., One effect of all those dams is to drastically reduce the amount of sediment that reaches the delta. The sediment is an essential element of the local ecology and also protects the shoreline from erosion. In some areas the shoreline is receding by more than five metres a year., Not enough sediment or water is getting to the delta, says Joan Francesc Vidal, director of the Ebro Delta nature reserve, which is home to around 95 species of birds and a stopover for around 300 migrating species., Vidal believes the solution lies in forcing the companies that generate electricity to release more sediment, and redistributing the sand that storms shift northwards back to the southern beaches., “There are a range of views on how to solve the problem, from building underwater defences to simply letting nature take its course,” Vidal says., “Personally, I believe redistributing the sand is the least disruptive and cheapest.”, Marta Subirà, the Catalan government environment minister, believes the political challenge is almost as great as the environmental one. “The European, Spanish and the Catalan governments haven’t always been on the same page in how to deal with this,” she says., Lluís Soler, the mayor of Deltebre, is more forthright. He accuses both regional and national governments of wilfully neglecting a vital part of Spain’s natural heritage. “The problem is there are only 80,000 people living in the delta, and that’s not many votes,” he says., “Neither the Catalan nor the Spanish government has committed itself to the measures needed to conserve the Ebro Delta. They do nothing, or at best carry out studies that result in nothing. They do the minimum to ensure there’s rice so they can have a paella at the weekend.”we have nothing to keep the sea out the struggle to save spains ebro delta", "label": 0}, "train-272": {"text": "\nThe government must invest in cycling. Here's how to do it\n, Co-chair of all-party parliamentary group on cycling and walking sets out a manifesto for active travel, Ruth Cadbury MP, \n\nTue 11 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2020 04.21 EST\n\n, The all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking has, in collaboration with its 80 member groups, set out a manifesto for cycling and walking. The economic case for investment in these modes of travel is strong. We get £5.50 for every £1 we invest and the benefits are cross-cutting: a healthier population; stronger, safer local communities; better access to jobs and education; and lower levels of pollution., Almost three years ago the government committed to a cycling and walking investment strategy for England, with a stated aim to return walking levels to 300 stages (ie part of a journey) per person per year, double cycling stages by 2025 and increase walking to school. As many people pointed out at the time, the investment strategy had little in the way of actual investment. Indeed, dedicated funding for cycling from government since then has been sporadic and meagre, with only a handful of cities investing at the levels required to catch up with the level we see in neighbouring, successful countries for active travel such as the Netherlands., Last week the government published its first report on progress and it makes for interesting reading. Walking and cycling levels are both marginally up but the government admits current funding will only achieve 40% of its ambitions to increase active travel. If it is serious about meeting the targets, the government therefore needs to allocate and spend at least another £3.6bn on cycling and walking in the next few years. The Conservative party promised a £350m cycling infrastructure fund in its manifesto, the details of which are keenly awaited. This will be a start but much more investment is needed., The government has suggested £1.2bn was invested in the three years to 2019 and a similar amount will be invested up to 2021. But in total that’s still only £7 per head per year, the equivalent of a couple of cups of coffee. The figure is up from a few years ago but still woefully low. Only a quarter of the money came directly from the Department for Transport, mostly for ongoing Bikeability training and the final years of the Cycling Cities Ambition fund., At the same time, local authorities have been dealing with swingeing cuts to revenue funding, with most capital investment diverted to roads and railways. Nearly all the funding planned for walking and cycling is merely assumed proportions of existing budgets: 11-13% of expenditure on small local authority schemes; 9% of road maintenance and 5% of large infrastructure projects. These figures may be accurate but there’s little suggestion this has changed over time. All that’s happened is the Department for Transport has got better at calculating and reporting them., What’s worse, other policies are having a perverse effect. Planning rules mean local authorities have little scope to prevent developers building on often unsuitable sites with limited access to active travel networks. Some funding is attributed to the construction of cycling and walking routes adjacent to new roads that enable sprawling, low-density car-based developments on the edges of towns and cities., This is clearly better than building infrastructure with no thought whatsoever for walking or cycling, but it’s low impact compared with the plans that ambitious cities are putting forward. These include Greater Manchester, which is focused on retrofitting cycling and walking infrastructure urban corridors that help tackle wider problems such as poor air quality and inactivity. Such cities are already investing £15 per person per year, with the aim of getting to £50., Funding is at the heart of our manifesto but there’s much else besides, from improved road traffic law to cycle training for all. What’s clear from the government’s progress report is that we need long-term commitment to cycling and walking from all parties., • Ruth Cadbury MP is a co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking.the government must invest in cycling heres how to do it", "label": 0}, "train-273": {"text": "\nCountry diary: rooks assemble in the fading light before roosting\n, Pulborough Brooks, West Sussex: Dozens of dark forms gather in a field, huddling so close that their shapes merge in the gloom, \nRob Yarham, \n\nTue 11 Feb 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, Pale blues are fading to grey in the sky.

Six more rooks fly in as I count, and two carrion crows land and hop around the perimeter of the group, attracted by the flock, perhaps expecting to find food. The rooks and jackdaws are gathering together before flying to their roost., I wait for them to take off to see where they go, but they remain on the ground as the light finally fails completely. In the end, the darkness and cold win this time, and I walk on – making a note to find out on another, warmer evening. country diary rooks assemble in the fading light before roosting", "label": 0}, "train-274": {"text": "\nCar ‘splatometer’ tests reveal huge decline in number of insects\n, Research shows abundance at sites in Europe has plunged by up to 80% in two decades, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 15.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2020 20.15 EST\n\n, Two scientific studies of the number of insects splattered by cars have revealed a huge decline in abundance at European sites in two decades., The research adds to growing evidence of what some scientists have called an “insect apocalypse”, which is threatening a collapse in the natural world that sustains humans and all life on Earth. A third study shows plummeting numbers of aquatic insects in streams., The survey of insects hitting car windscreens in rural Denmark used data collected every summer from 1997 to 2017 and found an 80% decline in abundance. It also found a parallel decline in the number of swallows and martins, birds that live on insects., The second survey, in the UK county of Kent in 2019, examined splats in a grid placed over car registration plates, known as a “splatometer”. This revealed 50% fewer impacts than in 2004. The research included vintage cars up to 70 years old to see if their less aerodynamic shape meant they killed more bugs, but it found that modern cars actually hit slightly more insects., “This difference we found is critically important, because it mirrors the patterns of decline which are being reported widely elsewhere, and insects are absolutely fundamental to food webs and the existence of life on Earth,” said Paul Tinsley-Marshall from Kent Wildlife Trust. “It’s pretty horrendous.”, Insects are crucial to the health of functioning ecosystems that are vital for food production and security. Pollinators like bees get a lot of attention because three quarters of crops producing fruit and seeds for human consumption depend on them, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. Other types of insects include herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids and predators that are crucial to ecosystems humans rely on to survive, acting as pest controllers, recycling nutrients and performing other tasks., How do humans harm insects?Habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, invasive species, the climate crisis and over-harvesting are all human-caused issues that put pressure on insects, say experts. The heavy use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers is the primary driver of harm to insects by humans, according to the first global scientific review of the literature in 2019., How bad is it?Bad. Insect populations around the world are plummeting, with 40% of species declining and a third endangered, according to the same literature review. On average, insect biomass on Earth has fallen 2.5% a year for the last three decades or so, which could mean they vanish within the next 100 years., What happens if insects become extinct? The survival of mankind would be at stake. With no insects to pollinate the crops humans rely on to eat or perform vital functions in ecosystems, humans would be in trouble., What can we do about it?Insect experts have devised a roadmap for conservation and recovery. In the short term, humans must phase out pesticide use, prioritise nature-based farming methods and reduce light, noise and water pollution. In the long term, scientists have called for an international body to monitor the health of insect populations and action taken to help them., “Most naturalists who are out in nature have seen this coming over a long time,” said Anders Pape Møllerfrom the Paris-Sud University in France, who has been visiting the Danish study area for 50 years. “My colleagues remember going on summer holidays as children and their parents had to stop their car to clean the windscreen so they could continue. This is certainly not a problem any more.”, Insect population collapses have been reported in Germany and Puerto Rico, and the first global scientific review, published in February 2019, said widespread declines threatened to cause a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”. Insects pollinate three-quarters of crops and another recent study showed widespread losses of such insects across Britain., The causes of decline are the destruction of natural habitat, pesticides and the impacts of the climate crisis. Light pollution has also been cited as a key “bringer of insect apocalypse”., The survey in Kent analysed nearly 700 car journeys reported by volunteers from June to August 2019. The bug splats on the registration plate were counted to calculate the number of impacts per kilometre. This was 50% lower than an RSPB survey using the same methodology found in 2004., “The most surprising thing was how rarely we actually found anything on the plate at all,” said Tinsley-Marshall. This was despite the data showing that modern cars hit more bugs, perhaps because older models push a bigger layer of air – and insects – over the vehicle., The Danish research, published in the journal Ecology and Evolution, used data from an average of 65 car journeys a year on the same stretch of road and at the same speed between 1997 and 2017. Møller took account of the time of day, temperature, wind speed and date of the journey and found an 80% decline in insect abundance over the 21-year period. Checks using insect nets and sticky traps showed the same trend., Møller said the causes were likely to be “a bit of everything”, but noted significant changes due to global heating. “In my 50 years, the temperature in April, May and June has increased by 1.5C 2.7F on average in my study area,” he said. “The amount of rain has increased by 50%. We are talking about dramatic differences.”, The stream research, published in the journal Conservation Biology, analysed weekly data from 1969 to 2010 on a stream in a German nature reserve, where the only major human impact is climate change., “Overall, water temperature increased by 1.88C and discharge patterns changed significantly. These changes were accompanied by an 81.6% decline in insect abundance,” the scientists reported. “Our results indicate that climate change has already altered wildlife communities severely, even in protected areas.”, Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of the charity Buglife, said: “These new studies reinforce our understanding of the dangerously rapid disappearance of insect life in both the air and water. It is becoming clear that the four horsemen of the insect apocalypse are climate change, habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and pollution. It is essential we create more joined up space for insects that is safe from pesticides, climate change and other harm.”, Most scientific research to date has shown serious declines in the number of insects in the places studied. “There is no doubt about this,” said Møller. “What there is slight doubt about is the extent to which this occurs across geographical and temporal scales.”, Long-term studies are rare and mostly from Europe and North America, with a few ranging from Australia to China and Brazil to South Africa, but hardly any elsewhere. There has also been discussion about the best methodologies among researchers., “But that is not the main point,” said Tinsley-Marshall. “I think it’s pretty clear that something pretty catastrophic is going on.” Kent Wildlife Trust is now working on a smartphone app to make it easier for volunteers to provide insect splat data.car splatometer tests reveal huge decline number insects", "label": 0}, "train-275": {"text": "\nCOP 26 must be 'value for money', Johnson warns Scotland\n, Nicola Sturgeon criticises PM as officials look at London back-up for Glasgow summit, \nHeather Stewart, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 14.22 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2020 14.32 EST\n\n, The government has warned that staging the COP 26 climate summit must represent “value for taxpayers’ money”, amid friction with the Scottish government over the policing costs of holding the event in Glasgow., It emerged on Wednesday that government officials have been scoping out the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands for the high-profile international summit, which the UK is due to host in November., The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, responded by accusing Boris Johnson of “playing politics with the biggest issue of our time”, with the build-up to the conference already hampered by the sacking of the former Tory minister Claire O’Neill as its chair., Asked about the apparent uncertainty over the venue, the prime minister’s press secretary said the government was determined to hold the event in Glasgow as promised, but issued a thinly veiled warning to the Scottish government about allowing the costs to escalate., “We are committed to holding COP 26 in Glasgow, but the Scottish government needs to work with us to make sure this is a successful summit, which showcases the UK as a world leader in tackling climate change and represents value for the UK taxpayer,” he said., He added: “It is standard practice to carry out contingency planning for major international events at this scale.”, One Whitehall source with knowledge of the plans complained privately that Edinburgh had not yet provided the government in London with a full breakdown of the costs for staging the event., Scotland’s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, said earlier this year that he believed the cost of policing COP 26 could run to as much as £200m, and warned it was “fanciful” to suggest it would not have a major impact on people living locally. He added: “Candidly, it is my professional opinion that any suggestion that the climate change conference will not impact on the wider community of Scotland is fanciful.”, The spat appeared to be the latest indication of vexed relations between London and Edinburgh., A Scottish government spokesperson said: “Scotland looks forward to welcoming the United Nations delegates and participants from around the world later this year. Glasgow is recognised internationally for its strong track record at hosting major international events and we are working collaboratively with the UK government, Glasgow city council, Police Scotland and other partners to ensure the conference is a success., “The Scottish government has had no notification of any intention to move the venue.” At recent meetings with UK government and United Nations organisers, there has been no discussion of alternative venues., O‘Neill’s successor is expected to be announced on Thursday, as Johnson reshapes his cabinet. He had approached David Cameron and William Hague about the role, but both turned it down., Michael Gove has taken oversight of the preparations, as the Cabinet Office is the sponsoring ministry, and gave a speech about it earlier this week – but government sources suggest the job is likely to be considered too onerous to add to his already extensive list of responsibilities., Other names in the frame include the new peer and Defra minister Zac Goldsmith, whom Johnson put in the Lords after he lost his Richmond Park seat in December.cop 26 must be value for money johnson warns scotland", "label": 0}, "train-276": {"text": "\nCall for new committee to get COP26 talks back on track\n, Acting Lib Dem leader Ed Davey calls for action as he lambasts ‘shambolic’ approach to talks, \nFiona Harvey and \nLibby Brooks, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 13.06 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2020 04.42 EST\n\n, A cross-party committee of MPs, green campaigning groups, business leaders and climate experts is needed to advise the government on crunch UN climate talks later this year to put the UK’s hosting of the COP26 talks back on track, the Liberal Democrat acting leader, Sir Ed Davey, is expected to say., His call, which will form part of a speech on climate delivered at Birkbeck College in London on Thursday, comes after the energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, told a meeting of ambassadors that the UK could not afford to allow the talks to fail because of the additional pressures of Brexit., “If you want global leadership on the climate crisis, you have to show that global action on the climate can be politically popular,” Davey, former energy and climate secretary in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government, told the Guardian., “We need NGOs, politicians and business leaders to form a committee to help to reach greater dialogue on international action. The UK needs to lead on this, for COP26 and beyond.”, Davey criticised the government’s handling of COP26 planning so far, which got off to a bad start nearly two weeks ago with the abrupt sacking of the intended president, former energy minister Claire O’Neill, days before the scheduled launch. O’Neill went on to make vitriolic public attacks on Johnson., “It has been shambolic,” said Davey. “Insiders are tearing their hair out. If you want to be credible hosts, you have to engage with people, with society, with NGOs far more.”, Leading figures in international climate diplomacy have expressed increasing disquiet over the UK’s conduct of the talks so far, warning that ministers and officials are falling behind on the preparations needed. Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and twice a UN climate envoy, said the perception that no one in the UK wanted to serve as president – after the post was turned down by David Cameron and former foreign minister William Hague – was damaging., Kwarteng was forced on Wednesday morning to reassure international participants that the talks would be a success and that the government was treating them as a priority., He attended a high-level meeting of previous COP presidents held by the International Energy Agency in Paris, where he was questioned by the Kenyan government and others on the UK’s commitment., “We can’t guarantee success, it’s not something we can gold-plate, but this is absolutely our No 1 priority as a government,” he said. “We really cannot afford it to be a failure, at an international level and at a national level, given where we are with Brexit and other issues.”, On Wednesday, fresh controversy over the Glasgow venue for the talks added to the sense of confusion, after a government source told the Financial Times that ministers were considering booking the ExCeL conference centre in London as an alternative., The Scottish government had received no notification of any intention to move the venue, a spokesperson said. “Scotland looks forward to welcoming the UN delegates and participants from around the world. Glasgow is recognised internationally for its strong track record at hosting major international events, and we are working collaboratively with the UK government, Glasgow city council, Police Scotland and other partners to ensure the conference is a success.”, UN officials visited the Glasgow venue this week and liaised with all the authorities involved., Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, told a conference in London on Tuesday that she hoped there could be a constructive relationship between her government and Boris Johnsons’s in the approach to COP26., Davey said changing the venue would “send the wrong signals, especially post-Brexit. We are stronger in the climate change debate internationally if we are a united kingdom.”, Greenpeace welcomed Davey’s call for an independent committee that would include civil society. Rebecca Newsom, head of politics, said: “There’s certainly a need for a more transparent, inclusive and joined-up approach to the UK climate summit, and this could be one of the ways to achieve it. Cross-party committees have a strong record of holding governments to account, and given how planet-critical this summit is, the case for more scrutiny and transparency is overwhelming.”, The Green party’s co-leader Jonathan Bartley said: “At the moment COP26 is heading for failure because the government is unwilling to step up and take the responsibility and action necessary to facilitate its success. So, we’re on board with the fact that scrutiny of the process is crucial., “But we would need to see what actual powers this cross-party committee would have and to what extent the government will be required to act on its recommendations. It also needs to be linked to a grassroots-led proper democratic programme of engagement that genuinely seeks to empower and strengthen communities.”call for new committee to get cop26 talks back on track", "label": 0}, "train-277": {"text": "\nVoters can help bring an end to climate anxiety\n, Letters, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 12.50 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2020 13.20 EST\n\n, As a parent of two children, aged nine and 12, I read with deep concern, though not surprise, your article on the rise of climate anxiety among young people (Take action to reduce anxiety, psychologists advise, 10 February)., I remember vividly the Guardian’s coverage of the Earth Summit in 1992 and the prof ound impact that had on me at the age of 26. Many climate marches and lifestyle changes later, I find myself also at a point of near despair when I look around at the abundance of poorly equipped, scientifically and socially illiterate leaders we have around the globe. They are not fit for the enormous task of beginning to fix our world – they are certainly not looking out for the next generation – and yet people my age seem to be voting for them in ever greater numbers., The legacy that Trump, Morrison, Bolsonaro, Johnson and their ilk are leaving our kids is a loss of hope. And when people lose hope, they often give up. Without a mass awakening by the voters (and non-voters) who are perpetuating this situation, I believe that the status quo they’re all so desperate to maintain will be abandoned en masse by those who will never benefit from it, long before the full ravages of climate change hit us.David SummersBristol, • Readers may be interested to know that the Climate Psychology Alliance has for the last 10 years been providing support, conducting research and running workshops on all aspects of the climate crisis and our emotional responses.

In general, working on solutions is better for us than focusing on problems., Many good people are promoting small, individual changes which together will mean a lot. But in this emergency, we need to go much further. We must also urgently learn about large-scale solutions – the kind that government is needed for. Only by learning enough to make very specific and knowledgeable demands of government can we hope to get them to change in time. , At the grassroots level, in our own localities we need to come together to see how local (and national) practices can change to cut carbon, restore the environment and care for people. There is plenty of information to help us: the 100 changes suggested in Drawdown to reverse global warming; Catherine Rowett’s report on Energising the East; the work of the Leeds Climate Commission; Isabella Tree’s Wilding project; and many others. Changes that all promote a happier, healthier, more equal society., It will be a huge task, but a heart-warming one, which will make us an informed public able to hold politicians to account, and in future perhaps vote for more sensible ones.

Under the EU’s funding programme up to 50% of the costs of each project could be covered by European taxpayers., The consulting firm Artelys has claimed in a report that the majority of the projects, stretching from Ireland to Croatia, are “unnecessary”., Environmental groups said gas firms were enjoying the fruits of heavy lobbying and the sector’s advantageous position within the commission’s decision-making institutions., An industry-led advisory body provides the European commission with forecasts on Europe’s future energy needs., Colin Roche, climate justice coordinator for Friends of the Earth Europe, said: “This climate hypocrisy has to end. Following unprecedented disasters like Australia’s wildfires, history will look unkindly on those who today backed building more fossil fuel pipelines and terminals., “A European green deal is not possible with more fossil fuels, and Europe needs to go fossil-free fast.”, The European energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, from Estonia, had asked the parliament to back the proposal on the grounds that three-quarters of the 151 projects were electricity- rather than gas-based. , The parliament had the option of accepting the entire list, the fourth proposed by the commission under its “connecting Europe” programme, or voting it down in its entirety., Simson said: “An objection to the 4th PCI Projects of Common Interest list would mean that the 3rd PCI list remains in force – a list with 40% more gas projects than the new list., “As a consequence, key electricity interconnectors and energy transition projects such as the North Sea Wind Power Hub, new smart grid projects and new CO2 network projects would not be eligible for funding under the Connecting Europe Facility.”, Simson said she would ensure the next project list “reflects the European green deal priorities”, in reference to the EU’s goal of carbon emission neutrality by 2050. She insisted that being on the new list did not guarantee funding., Ciarán Cuffe, an Irish MEP from the Green party, who voted against the projects, said: “Given the severity of the climate emergency and the little time we have left to avert climate catastrophe, it is wrong to spend more public money on fossil fuel investments., “We are past the time to channel public money into expensive and unnecessary fossil fuel projects when Europe should be investing in energy efficiency and renewables.”eu accused of climate crisis hypocrisy after backing 32 gas projects", "label": 0}, "train-279": {"text": "\nGiant dams enclosing North Sea could protect millions from rising waters\n, Dams between Scotland, Norway, France and England ‘a possible solution’ to problem, \nJon Henley and \nAlan Evans, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 10.44 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 31 Mar 2020 05.26 EDT\n\n, A Dutch government scientist has proposed building two mammoth dams to completely enclose the North Sea and protect an estimated 25 million Europeans from the consequences of rising sea levels as a result of global heating., Sjoerd Groeskamp, an oceanographer at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, said a 475km dam between north Scotland and west Norway and another 160km one between west France and south-west England was “a possible solution”., In a paper to be published this month in the American Journal of Meteorology, Groeskamp and Joakim Kjellsson of the Geomar centre for ocean research in Kiel, Germany, say the idea is affordable and technically feasible – if intended more as “a warning of the immensity of the problem hanging over our heads”., Based on existing projects, the scientists estimate the cost of building a so-called North Sea Enclosure Dyke at between €250bn and €500bn. Spread over 20 years, the annual cost to the 14 countries that would be protected by it would amount to just over 0.1% of their combined GDP, they calculate., Groeskamp said it also appeared technically viable. The depth of the North Sea between France and England rarely exceeded 100 metres, he said, while between Scotland and Norway it averaged about 127 metres, peaking at just over 320 off the coast of Norway., “We are currently able to build fixed platforms in depths exceeding 500 metres, so such a dam seems feasible,” he said., International experts agreed that the plans looked theoretically viable. “I guess it depends on what timescale we’re thinking of,” said Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading., “If you look back hundreds and hundreds of years, then we’ve made some significant adaptations to our landscape, and the Netherlands is an example of that … We can, as humans, do amazing things.”, She added that it was “good that we’re thinking outside the box. I think it is really important that we keep thinking about these ideas, because the future looks very scary. If you look back into the 1940s in the UK, the Thames Barrier probably seemed equally ridiculous. It depends what happens in the next 20-30 years, how bad it gets, and then perhaps we will need something like this.”, However, Cloke cautioned that a dam may not be the best use of the money. “Maybe we should be thinking about making populations resilient to flooding in different ways, and also think about what we can do to stop the climate getting worse – invest in keeping ourselves safe in the long term.”, The authors acknowledge that over time, their project would eventually turn much of the North Sea into a vast tide-free freshwater lake, radically changing its ecosystem. “We estimated the construction costs by extrapolating the costs for large dams in South Korea,” Groeskamp said., “But in the final calculation, we must also take into account factors such as the loss of income from North Sea fishing, the increased costs for shipping across the North Sea, and the costs of gigantic pumps to transport all of the river water that currently flows into the North Sea to the other side of the dam.”, However, the costs and consequences of doing nothing about rising sea levels would ultimately be “many times higher”, they warned. The project “makes it almost tangible what the consequences of rising sea levels will be”, Groeskamp said., “A rise of 10 metres by the year 2500 is predicted, according to the bleakest scenarios. This dam is therefore mainly a call to do something about climate change now. If we do nothing, this extreme dam might just be the only solution.”, While experts have criticised Boris Johnson’s plan to build a 20-mile, £15bn bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland as fraught with possibly insurmountable technical difficulties, the Dutch have been successfully protecting themselves against the sea with dykes for centuries., Their original 32km Enclosure Dyke, or Afsluitdijk, officially opened in 1933, sealed off a large North Sea inlet that became the freshwater IJsselmeer lake, and subsequently allowed the largest land reclamation project in history., The Zuiderzee works – of which the Afsluitdijk was a key part – and Delta works, a vast series of dams, sluices, locks and storm-surge barriers protecting the south-west Netherlands from the sea, are widely seen as marvels of hydraulic engineering., The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea levels will rise by 30cm-60cm by 2100, even if the Paris climate accord pledges are met. If emissions continue on their present trends, it foresees an 84cm rise by 2100 and up to 5.4 metres by 2300., The threat is particularly acute in the Netherlands, about a third of which lies below sea level. Last year, the Dutch government assembled a committee of specialists to monitor the threat closely and devise possible responses., The government has warned that while it expects its own defences to hold until about 2050, bolstering them further could take years: the past three decades of Dutch sea defence works are designed to cope with a rise of only 40cm., • This article was amended on 13 February 2020 to clarify that the estimated cost of the project as a percentage of the GDP of the countries affected is annual and spread over 20 years.giant dams could protect millions from rising north sea", "label": 0}, "train-280": {"text": "BP's statement on reaching net zero by 2050 – what it says and what it means, Jonathan Watts breaks down the oil company’s statements on its plans to cut carbon emissions in the coming decades, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 10.39 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2020 12.59 EST\n\n, \nJonathan Watts, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 10.39 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2020 12.59 EST\n\n, BP’s new chief executive, Bernard Looney, has announced plans to make it a net zero company by 2050, and outlined its strategy in a document. The Guardian’s global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, examines what it says – and what it means:, BP today set a new ambition to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero. , The ambition is supported by 10 aims., Five aims to get BP to net zero:, 1. Net zero across BP’s operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner., 2. Net zero on carbon in BP’s oil and gas production on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner., 3. 50% cut in the carbon intensity of products BP sells by 2050 or sooner., 4. Install methane measurement at all BP’s major oil and gas processing sites by 2023 and reduce methane intensity of operations by 50%., 5. Increase the proportion of investment into non-oil and gas businesses over time., This is a step forward from the company’s current position, but it is too little, too late to tackle the climate crisis. Looney, as CEO of Britain’s biggest oil company, is trying to placate protesters and activist shareholders by promising to reduce the company’s direct carbon emissions (those related to production, transport and other areas of operations) to zero over the next 30 years. Over the same period, BP will also reduce indirect emissions from burning its oil and gas to zero and halve the carbon intensity of the products it sells. But there is nothing in this statement to suggest BP will move away from previous plans to increase oil and gas production by 20% over the next 10 years. That would be a disaster. To keep global heating to a relatively safe level of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the world needs to slash emissions – mostly from fossil fuels – by half by 2030., Five aims to help the world get to net zero:, 6. More active advocacy for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing., 7. Further incentivise BP’s workforce to deliver aims and mobilise them to advocate for net zero. , 8. Set new expectations for relationships with trade associations. , 9. Aim to be recognised as a leader for transparency of reporting, including supporting the recommendations of the TCFD. , 10. Launch a new team to help countries, cities and large companies decarbonise., BP is responding to criticism that it lobbies against climate action and withholds information about its carbon footprint. In the future, the company says it will encourage staff and trade associations to promote net zero policies. This could be an important shift, but the devil is in the detail (see below). , To deliver the ambition, BP will fundamentally reorganise to become , a more focused, more integrated company, comprising:, · Four business groups to deliver performance and value growth: , Production and operations; customers and products; gas and low-carbon energy, and innovation and engineering., · Three integrators to identify and maximise opportunities: , Sustainability and strategy; regions, cities and solutions, and trading and shipping., · Four core enablers to support business delivery: , Finance; legal; people and culture, and communications and advocacy., BP will reorganise. What this means for the climate will depend on how much authority is given to the divisions related to low-carbon energy and sustainability. If they are left on the fringe, little will change., BP is committed to performing while transforming.,  No change to BP’s fundamental commitments: , · To safe and reliable operations., · To delivering BP’s investor proposition, including commitments on:, - growing sustainable free cash flow and shareholder distributions over long term;, - maintaining strong financial frame and cost and capital discipline, and deleveraging the balance sheet;, - delivering 2021 free cash flow targets., Despite the talk of change, BP is reassuring shareholders that its core priorities are the same, including more dividends. This aims to reassure skittish investors who have got used to the oil company providing the third biggest payouts on the London stock exchange. The big unanswered question is whether this will be achieved as in the past – by increasing production of fossil fuels – or through a new shift to renewables., New purpose and ambition , BP’s new CEO, Bernard Looney, today announces a new purpose and a new ambition for the company. , BP’s new purpose is reimagining energy for people and our planet. , The purpose is underpinned by an industry-leading ambition – for BP to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero – and this ambition is supported by 10 aims. , To deliver all this, BP will fundamentally transform its whole organisation, and maintain its commitment to performing while transforming., If the oft-repeated phrase “performing while transforming” is to be anything other than corporate speak, the company will need to do more than reorganise management. It will have to embark on an energy transition. But there are no concrete details here about scaling down production of fossil fuels or scaling up renewables. This will raise concerns that the company thinks it can just plant trees or use other offsets to make up for ever greater petrochemical production. This would not be enough to stabilise the climate., Bernard Looney said: “The world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero. We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner. To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it. ,  “This will certainly be a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity. It is clear to me, and to our stakeholders, that for BP to play our part and serve our purpose, we have to change. And we want to change - this is the right thing for the world and for BP.”, This is a clear recognition of the scale of the challenge ahead and it is encouraging that the Irish CEO states oil companies can no longer simply justify themselves as providers of reliable, affordable energy. This has been their fallback position for many years., Helge Lund, BP’s chairman, commented: “Energy markets are changing, driven by climate change, technology and societal expectations, and the board supports Bernard and his new leadership team’s ambition for BP. Aiming for net zero is not only the right thing for BP, it is the right thing for our shareholders and for society more broadly. As we embark on this ambitious agenda, we will maintain a strong focus on safe, reliable and efficient operations and on delivering the promises we have made to our investors.”, This highlights the importance of climate protests and the divestment campaign. Social pressure is forcing more investors to recognise the danger of fossil fuels. The BP chairman is acknowledging the company is being pushed into action. In the past year, demonstrators have blocked access to the BP headquarters, called for halts to sponsorship of museums and the arts, and disrupted shareholders’ meetings. The markets are responding. Major investors are starting to pull out of petrochemical firms. One Wall Street analyst recently declared he was “done with fossil fuels”., BP’s new ambition to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner covers the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations worldwide, currently around 55m tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MteCO2e) a year, and the carbon in the oil and gas that it produces, equivalent currently to around 360 MteCO2e emissions a year - both on an absolute basis. Taken together, delivery of these aims would equate to a reduction in emissions to net zero from what is currently around 415 MteCO2e a year. , “This is what we mean by making BP net zero. It directly addresses all the carbon we get out of the ground as well as all the greenhouse gases we emit from our operations. These will be absolute reductions, which is what the world needs. If this were to happen to every barrel of oil and gas produced, the emissions problem for our sector would be solved. But of course, the world is not that simple; the whole energy system has to be transformed and everyone has a contribution to make - producers and sellers of energy, policy makers and everyone who uses energy” - Bernard Looney. , Therefore, BP also aims to help its customers reduce their emissions by halving the carbon intensity of the products it sells, again by 2050 or sooner – offering customers more and better choices of low- and no-carbon products., The promise to halve the carbon intensity of products is potentially the most far-reaching part of BP’s new strategy. It recognises that petroleum companies have a responsibility for how their products are used. Until now, they have tried to foist these so-called scope 3 emissions on to consumers., BP also aims to install methane measurement at all of its existing major oil and gas processing sites by 2023 and then reduce the methane intensity of its operations by 50%. , And over time BP also aims to increase the proportion of investment it makes into non-oil and gas businesses: ,  “We expect to invest more in low-carbon businesses – and less in oil and gas – over time. The goal is to invest wisely, into businesses where we can add value, develop at scale, and deliver competitive returns” – Bernard Looney., This language on transition to a low-carbon business is disappointingly vague. If “over time” means “after 2030”, then the shift will be too late. This caution may be the result of BP’s previous botched promises to move to solar energy under the leadership of former CEO John Browne. More detail may be forthcoming later this year when the company will unveil its next five-year strategy. The action on methane is welcome but long overdue. Petroleum companies have been under-reporting this extremely potent greenhouse gas and failing to remedy a major cause of climate disruption., The ambition also includes a series of aims targeted at supporting the world’s progress towards net zero:, · More actively advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing; stopping corporate reputation advertising and redirecting resources to promote net zero policies, ideas, actions, collaborations and its own net zero ambition. , · Incentivising BP’s global workforce to deliver on the aims and mobilise them to become advocates for net zero; increasing the percentage of remuneration linked to emissions reductions. , · Setting new expectations for BP’s relationships with trade associations, making the case for BP’s views on climate change, being transparent where views differ, and being prepared to leave those where alignment cannot be reached. , · Being recognised as an industry leader for the transparency of reporting, working constructively with the TCFD and other groups to develop good practices and standards for transparency of reporting. BP today announced its support for the recommendations of the TCFD., · Launching a new team to create integrated clean energy and mobility solutions and to help countries, cities and corporations around the world decarbonise., This would be a very positive step, but BPs past record on greenwashing and lobbying gives little cause for confidence. This oil company reportedly spends more than any of its rivals on influencing politicians and public opinion. BP donated $500,000 to the inauguration of Donald Trump and then pushed the White House to cut environmental regulations. It is also a member of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade organisation that has actively campaigned against climate action and undermined climate science. If BP keeps its promise to use that influence for zero-carbon goals, the political world could change dramatically., The structure of BP’s organisation – and of much of the industry – has been broadly the same for more than a century, split into separate organisations – upstream, downstream, and other businesses. To deliver its new ambition and aims, BP will now undergo a fundamental reorganisation., “We need to reinvent BP. Our historic structure has served us well but, in order to keep up with rapidly evolving customer demands and society’s expectations, we need to become more integrated and more focused. So we are undertaking a major reorganisation, introducing a new structure, a new leadership team and new ways of working for all of us” – Bernard Looney., Under the plans, BP’s existing, largely autonomous business segments - upstream and downstream - will be dismantled and the group reorganised globally into a more focused and more integrated entity, comprising 11 teams. The heads of these teams will make up BP’s new leadership team., Management restructuring that could mean a little or a lot for the climate depending on who is appointed and what power they have. For the moment, this is probably of more interest to staff and shareholders., Performance and value growth will be delivered by four business groups:, · Production and operations, led by Gordon Birrell, will be BP’s new operational centre, bringing its operations together, focused on driving safety, efficiency and value growth. , · Customers and products, headed by Emma Delaney, will focus on customers as the driving force for the energy products and services of the future, and on customer experience and expansion in rapidly changing markets. , · Gas and low-carbon energy, led by Dev Sanyal, will unite energy teams currently dispersed around BP to create focused low-carbon solutions. It will also pursue opportunities in decarbonisation and new value chains such as hydrogen and CCUS., · Innovation and engineering, headed by David Eyton, will bring added momentum to BP’s venturing and Launchpad investments and act as a catalyst for creating value from disruptive opportunities. It will also house BP’s engineering discipline and safety and operational risk team.,  Three integrators will be established to find and maximise opportunities for BP:,  · Strategy and sustainability, headed by Giulia Chierchia, who is joining BP from McKinsey, will ensure that sustainability is embedded at the top of BP and provide a single groupwide approach to strategy and capital allocation., · Regions, cities and solutions, led by William Lin, will build relationships with regions, cities and large corporations, aiming to develop integrated energy and carbon solutions that can bring emissions down at scale. , · Trading and shipping, led by Carol Howle, will build on BP’s existing deep expertise in its existing business to more effectively help BP capture new commercial opportunities and add value. , Four teams will serve as enablers of business delivery:,  · Finance, led by Murray Auchincloss., · Legal, headed by Eric Nitcher. , · People and culture, headed by Kerry Dryburgh., · Communications and advocacy, led by Geoff Morrell.,  Over the next few months, the new BP leadership team will focus on building their teams and on developing BP’s strategy to deliver the ambition. , “Together we will aim to build a more agile, innovative and efficient BP. A purpose-driven, digitally enabled, fully integrated organisation. I’m confident that this new leadership team, together with all our people, have the skill and will to turn BP into a thriving sustainable energy business that is a force for good in a net zero world” – Bernard Looney., These personnel changes are climate positive without being revolutionary. It is good news that the head of alternative energy in BP, Dev Sanyal, appears to have been given more authority. The promise to embed sustainability at the top of BP under Giulia Chierchia sounds nice, but it also contradicts the previous assertion that shareholders (rather than the environment or society) are fundamental. , Performing while transforming, Despite the planned groupwide programme of change, BP’s fundamental commitments remain unchanged – to safety and to investors. , “BP needs to continue to perform as we transform. As committed as I am to making transformation happen, I am equally committed to some fundamental principles that have served us well. Safe and reliable operations will always underpin all we do, and we remain committed to meeting the promises we have made to our shareholders. We can only reimagine energy if we are financially strong, able to pay the dividend our owners depend on and to generate the cash to invest in new low and no-carbon businesses” - Bernard Looney., BP’s commitment to safe and reliable operations is unchanged with safety as a core value. The new structure is expected to underpin and strengthen safety performance. , BP also remains committed to its investor proposition of growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions to shareholders over the long term. It continues to be committed to a strong financial frame including deleveraging the balance sheet and maintaining capital discipline, to delivering its free cash flow targets for 2021, and to staying focused on costs and pursuing efficiencies. , BP intends to host a capital markets day in September at which the leadership team will set out more information on BP’s strategy and near-term plans., Generating cash to invest in low-carbon business is another key phrase, but what it means for climate will depend how it is done. If the company were to quickly start selling off fossil fuel assets and use the money to pay dividends and invest in renewables, this would be huge step in the right direction. But if it plans to generate more revenue by expanding its fossil fuel business over the next 10 years or more, BP would remain part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Currently, the latter seems more likely. The meeting in September should reveal whether the change is genuine or just more PR fluff., As with the UK government, if BP are serious about climate action, they need to set a 2030 target. Anything else is just kicking the can down the road., \nJonathan Watts, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 10.39 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2020 12.59 EST\n\nbp statement on reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 what it says and what it means", "label": 0}, "train-281": {"text": "\n'£1bn pledged' for cycling and walking routes across England\n, Johnson told MPs figure was £350m but sources say he made error in ‘car crash of an announcement’, \nHelen Pidd North of England editor, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 09.52 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2020 14.30 EST\n\n, The government has earmarked £1bn for safe cycling and walking routes in the next five years – not £350m, as Boris Johnson mistakenly told parliament in what one expert called “a car crash of an announcement”, the Guardian has learned., But £1bn is still not enough to even build Greater Manchester’s 1,800-mile Bee Network of safe paths, according to its architect, Chris Boardman, a former Olympic cycling champion who is the region’s walking and cycling commissioner. He has asked Johnson for £1.2bn and says he will continue to do so., “The announcement doesn’t change anything for me. I’m asking for what is required to deliver a network, not asking how much can we have.

This, he said, would result in cyclists “enjoying hundreds of miles of brand-new separated lanes, with ‘mini-Hollands’ blooming like so many tulips in towns and cities right across the country”., Details were vague but a government press release promised “over 250 miles of new, high-quality separated cycle routes and safe junctions”, as well as pilots of low-traffic neighbourhoods – the so-called mini-Hollands – which prioritise people over cars., Asked in parliament by the Labour MP Ruth Cadbury – co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking – how much of the £5bn would go to cycling, Johnson hesitated, looked at his notes and said: “In the first stage, £350m.”, The investment was described by Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, as “a complete joke”., Cadbury had prefaced her question by pointing out that it would cost at least £5bn to achieve the government’s ambition of doubling the rate of cycling from 2% to 4% of all trips., But Johnson got his figures wrong, according to two sources in Downing Street. They insisted “at least £1bn” of the £5bn would be for walking and cycling, in addition to the £350m pledged in the Conservative election manifesto., “It was a car crash of an announcement,” said one well-placed source. “We are pretty sure Boris made a mistake when answering that question and in fact it’s about £1bn for cycling now.”, Cadbury said she would be submitting a written question asking for clarification on the matter. “Until I see it in black and white I won’t believe it. All this confusion is symptomatic of the chaos No 10 operates in,” she said., Rachel White, the head of public affairs at the walking and cycling charity Sustrans, said: “One billion is a step in the right direction but there is a long way to go to meet the government’s own ambitions and aims. Somewhere between £6bn and £8bn is what is needed to build capacity and capability in our walking and cycling networks.”1bn pledged for cycling and walking routes across england boris johnson", "label": 0}, "train-282": {"text": "\nUK could ban sale of petrol and diesel cars in 12 years, says Shapps\n, Transport secretary’s disclosure of earlier target likely to rattle carmakers, \nJasper Jolly, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 07.44 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2020 15.10 EST\n\n, The government could ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars in 2032, three years earlier than previously suggested, the transport secretary has said., A consultation launched last week suggested all cars with internal combustion engines could be banned from 2035 but Grant Shapps told BBC radio on Wednesday the ban could come within 12 years., The ban would happen by 2035 – or even 2032, subject to consultation, he said., The comments will add to the concerns of the car industry, which has criticised the government for “moving the goalposts” with its earlier announcement that the limits could come by 2035, from an initial expectation of a 2040 ban., Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said it was a “date without a plan”., Previous proposals also excluded some hybrid cars, which combine internal combustion engines with battery electric power., Hybrids are seen by carmakers as a key way of reducing the carbon footprint of their vehicles, and multiple companies such as Toyota and the Mercedes-Benz owner, Daimler, have bet heavily on hybrids to avoid steep EU fines., Shapps and Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, will meet the SMMT on Thursday, with the lobby group hoping to persuade the government that the industry will need more help to achieve the targets., Among the main concerns for carmakers are incentives such as grants for electric cars as well as building national infrastructure capable of charging millions of vehicles., During the third quarter of 2019, the Department for Transport recorded 22,596 registrations of ultra-low emission vehicles, which includes electric cars – 39% more than the same period in the previous year.

The result: a fourfold increase in people cycling along the route., Initial findings from a government report reveal how just 14 disconnected cycle schemes in eight English cities, part of the government’s Cycle City Ambition Fund programme (CCAF), have cut 440,000 car trips per year, replaced 2m kilometres of driving with cycling trips and made cycling attractive for a broader demographic., This week the government announced £5bn over five years for cycling and buses, including 250 miles of cycle routes, which they say will be built to tough new design standards. Although Boris Johnson said on Tuesday in the Commons that just £350m of that would be for cycling, this appeared to be a mistake. The DfT says there will not be any clarification on how much money will go where until the spending review, The transport announcement was met with derision from the opposition for its piecemeal nature, though Johnson said more money was coming in this month’s budget. However, the new CCAF report highlights how important it is for the government to build quality cycle routes that are more than just white paint., A quick history: it is a peculiar quirk that cycling has one of the best returns on investment of all transport, £5.50 per £1 spent, and yet it suffers the most myopic planning. So it was that in 2013, just eight English cities and regions received money to spend, sharpish, on cycling infrastructure and “softer measures” such as training and promotion., The lucky few sprang into action. They were: Birmingham, Cambridge, Greater Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Oxford, Bristol, Bath and north-east Somerset and south Gloucestershire, and West Yorkshire Combined Authority (Leeds, Bradford and neighbouring areas)., They came up with a mixed bag of cycle superhighways, shorter segregated routes, “mixed routes” of quiet roads, green space and segregated paths, city centre schemes, canal towpaths and junction treatments. Some were very good; others were not., The initial findings were city-wide increases in cycling in all eight areas and, in some places, a decrease in car journeys. But their success varied., These are interim figures, with work on the final report just starting. Their lessons are:, • Build it and they will cycle more – and drive less. The report’s authors note a very clear cycling uptick in cities that invested in cycling infrastructure, many with a similar magnitude of reduction in car use. At least 440,000 car trips per year have switched to cycle trips because of the new routes, or roughly 2m kilometres of driving. Some of the increase was a continuation of an upward trend in cycling before investment, which means many cities were “pushing at an open door”., • All cycle lanes are not created equal. Consistent, kerb-protected routes are a better investment than the less ambitious white-paint-on-the-road routes, if you want more people using them. The most successful routes were away from motor traffic entirely, including improved towpaths in Birmingham, where cycling increased by 157%. In Manchester, a decent-quality protected cycle route on Wilmslow Road has prompted increases of between 85% and 176% since completion – and numbers are still climbing. On Manchester’s Broughton cycleway, a lower-quality route “protected” by plastic wands and “armadillos” (little rubber blocks bolted to the road), there was, however, little change., • Better cycle routes mean greater diversity. The new infrastructure seems to attract people who are more representative of the general population. Surveys found 18% of new riders were from ethnic minority groups compared with 8% of existing cyclists and 14% of the general population. About 43% of new cyclists were women, compared with 33% of existing riders. The findings also suggest more new cyclists were from households with lower than average earnings than existing riders., • A bike lane here and there isn’t enough to improve safety, or perceptions of safety. For that, you need a network. Surveys from the eight areas showed little improvement in how safe people felt cycling there – particularly where children were concerned. This is hardly surprising, as most changes were only to a road or two in each location. , • Cycling investment brings health benefits. Half of people who already cycled and four-fifths of new cyclists say they noticed improvements in their wellbeing because of the new cycle routes., The government has admitted that it is just 40% of the way to its target of doubling cycling by 2025, and that “substantial further investment” is needed., The charity Cycling UK says that to meet the target, the government must invest a further £6-8bn by 2025 on top of the £2.4bn the government believes will be spent by 2021, as well as decent new design standards for cycle infrastructure., If our time machine could travel seven years into the future, we should expect to see similar people-friendly transformations in town and city centres up and down the country. Boris Johnson told the Commons yesterday that he wanted a new generation of cyclists to “pedal safely and happily to school and work in tree-dappled sunlight on their own network of segregated paths”. The excuses for not building that network are getting harder to make.investing in cycling pays off but ministers are ignoring the evidence", "label": 0}, "train-284": {"text": "\nTrump ‘turns back the clock’ by luring drilling companies to pristine lands\n, Energy companies have leased 9.9m acres from the administration – and the fossil fuels extracted could equal half a year of emissions from China, \nEmily Holden in Washington, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2020 11.08 EST\n\n, The Trump administration has offered oil companies a chunk of the American west and the Gulf of Mexico that’s four times the size of California – an expansive drilling plan that threatens to entrench the industry at the expense of other outdoor jobs, while locking in enough emissions to undermine global climate policy., Energy companies have leased 9.9m acres from the unprecedented 461m acres put up for rent by the Trump administration, according to a new analysis from the Wilderness Society., The fossil fuels extracted from those leases could equal half a year of emissions from China, the world’s top carbon polluter., The administration has jump-started this plan, independent government analysts say, by offering energy leases at bargain rates. That has lured drilling companies to pristine lands where an outdoor economy had already grown up around wildlife and the natural landscape., Trump’s Democratic opponents vow to close public lands to new drilling. But they probably can’t stop the extraction that Trump has already started., Despite a glut in US oil supply, the federal government has proposed leasing places like the Slickrock Bike Trail in Moab, Utah, where visitors pedal through petrified sand dunes and ancient seabeds., Locals have warned the potential air and water pollution aren’t worth damaging this national treasure., “If we really get to the point that we need to burn the Picassos to heat the house for an hour, we could still do that, but there’s no reason to lease these parcels now when they have a higher and better use,” said Ashley Korenblat, CEO of Western Spirit Cycling and managing director of the not-for-profit group Public Land Solutions., The leases are being signed as world scientists stress that pollution from oil, gas and coal needs to decline rapidly to avert catastrophe. Conservationists say the developed land will never again be wild and experts have repeatedly shown the sales aren’t even earning a fair return for taxpayers, costing the federal government and states billions of dollars., “We’re in an era now where fundamental questions need to be raised about whether there should be more leasing or not. Millions of acres are already under lease that are not being developed,” said David Hayes, the former deputy secretary of the interior department under President Barack Obama. “So why is the administration going so hard and fast over putting additional acreage up?”, Just as the Obama administration halted coal leasing on federal lands, Hayes argues the federal government should consider a moratorium for oil and gas. At the least, Trump officials should not allow drilling on frontier and sensitive areas, said Hayes, who is now the director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University School of Law., Nearly all the Democrats running for presidentwould ban fossil fuel extraction on federal land., Chase Huntley, energy and climate change director with the Wilderness Society, said the “tremendous area” the administration has offered to private companies and its disregard for the environment and climate “suggests the administration’s real interest here: which is advancing their agenda of energy dominance regardless of who it hurts”., The interior department and its Bureau of Land Management, which handles onshore leasing, did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did the trade group for the US oil and gas industry, the American Petroleum Institute., Much of the drilling on Trump-leased areas won’t happen now, while global supply is high and oil and gas prices are so low that the acres wouldn’t turn a large enough profit, but the Wilderness Society report shows that as a portion of the leases are acted upon they will be responsible for substantial pollution., On the low end, the leases could result in emissions equal to the annual output of Brazil., Pete Erickson, a senior scientist with the Stockholm Environment Institute, reviewed the analysis and called the low-end estimates “conservative”., Earth is already 1.1C hotter than it was before humans began to burn fossil fuels for industry., To keep the planet from climbing to 1.5C hotter, oil emissions would need to drop from 13 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year to less than 8 gigatons by 2030, according to an analysis by the climate change news organization Carbon Brief. Gas emissions would need to decline from 8 gigatons to fewer than 5 gigatons., In a report ordered by the Obama administration, the US Geological Survey in 2018 found that public lands account for 24% of the country’s emissions and vegetation on the same lands absorbs 15% of the nation’s carbon dioxide pollution., But the Trump administration has largely refused to consider what its actions on public lands will mean for the climate crisis., Last month the White House proposed changes to how it applies a bedrock environment law – the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act. Under the revisions, the government would no longer need to count climate impacts when approving infrastructure such as pipelines or leasing land for oil and gas drilling., The administration has also made revisions to rules that protected the environment but proved inconvenient for the oil and gas industry., “If there’s anything in the way of oil and gas leasing, it’s going to be pushed aside,” Hayes said, noting the reinterpretation of the Migratory Bird Act, changes to an agreement for protecting sage grouse, the shrinking of national monuments in Utah and the opening of sensitive portions of the Arctic National wildlife refuge and National Petroleum reserve to development., Independent analyses have found the US is not earning a fair amount from oil and gas leasing either., The Congressional Budget Office in 2016 concluded the federal government could increase its share of income from onshore leases by up to $1.2bn over 10 years. That figure would be about twice as large if it counted the money that would go to states. Audits by the Government Accountability Office have drawn similar conclusions that the government could demand more money., If the government had raised royalty rates years ago, it could have earned up to $12bn more for taxpayers between 2009 and 2019, according to the non-partisan fiscal policy group Taxpayers for Common Sense. States would have received about half that income., “We have policies that govern the way we lease our federal lands for oil and gas development that are a century old, and they just haven’t kept pace. And we have others that haven’t been looked at in decades. This has led to really a tremendous giveaway to the oil and gas industry,” said Autumn Hanna, vice-president of the non-partisan fiscal policy group Taxpayers for Common Sense. , In addition to expanding leasing opportunities, the Trump administration has opened lands that were once protected from industry. Last week the interior department finalized plans that allow mining, drilling and other development on lands recently removed from Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah., The landscapes there feature “classic red rock canyons”, “forested mesas”, and “fantastical geologic features”, ranging from standing rock pillars to streams that flash-flood several times a year, according to Steve Bloch, the conservation director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. The region has a dense concentration of prehistoric sites, where researchers are able to study the cultures of indigenous tribes., Bloch said that doesn’t matter to the federal government., “It’s clear from the administration’s approach to public lands, to their energy dominance agenda, that they believe the highest and best use of these places is for fossil fuel development,” Bloch said., Of the 9.9m acres leased, 2.2m acres are in Wyoming and 1.3m acres are in Alaska. Nearly 5m acres are in the Gulf of Mexico., Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said “at the broadest level, what we’re witnessing is a sort of wholesale turnover of America’s Arctic to the oil and gas industry”., Kolton said drilling on public lands was once done alongside arguments that the US needed to be energy independent, but the country is now a net exporter of oil. He believes the expansion of drilling, particularly in the Arctic, will be among Trump’s most damaging and longest-lasting environmental legacies., “Right now there’s an attempt to not just roll back what was done under Obama in Alaska, but to turn back the clock half a century and look to an era where oil, mining and logging operations were unchecked,” Kolton said. trumps legacy drilled public lands and the resulting carbon emissions", "label": 0}, "train-285": {"text": "\nFossil-fuel industry doubles donations to major parties in four years, report shows\n, Coal, oil and gas companies trying to ‘buy political power’, says Australian Conservation Foundation, \nChristopher Knaus, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 01.35 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2020 18.53 EST\n\n, The fossil-fuel industry has doubled its donations to the major parties in the past four years, new analysis suggests., A new Australian Conservation Foundation report examining last week’s dump of donations data suggests the coal, oil and gas industry gave $1.9m in 2018-19., That’s more than double the $894,336 it gave in 2015-16, the ACF says., The three biggest donors in 2018-19 were the oil and gas behemoth Woodside Petroleum, the coalminer Adani, and industry lobby group the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association., Across the four years, the largest donors were Woodside ($1m), Santos Limited ($567,537), Chevron ($452,017), Mineral Resources ($373,650), Origin Energy ($360,047), and Bluescope ($337,655)., The analysis excludes the massive $83.3m in donations made by Clive Palmer’s mining company, Mineralogy, to his United Australia party., The extractive sector was found to be overrepresented among large fossil-fuel donors., Six of the 10 top donors were extractors, and since 2015-16 the extractive sector had donated $3.3m, or about 60% of fossil-fuel donations, the analysis found., Labor and the Coalition took roughly the same amount from the industry over the four years, other than 2017-18 when donations to the Coalition far outstripped Labor. Donations to the Coalition were only slightly higher than to Labor during the 2018-19 election year., Fossil-fuel money has also been pumped into associated entities, groups that are aligned to the major parties., The Minerals Council of Australia gave money to Liberal and Nationals-aligned entities such as the Australian Business Network, Enterprise Victoria, John McEwen House and Platinum Circle, and Labor entities such as Progressive Business, the federal Labor business forum, federal Labor business exchange, and the Hunter federal campaign., Jolene Elberth, a campaigner with ACF, said the report showed the sector was attempting to “buy political power” through donations., “As more Australians demand action on climate change and the pressure builds on politicians to take the problem seriously, the fossil-fuel industry is doubling down by spending more money to influence public policy,” she said., It is impossible to tell whether the donations declared by both parties represent the true extent of fossil-fuel political financing. Australia’s electoral laws require donations to be declared only if they are above $14,000. Donations can be split into multiple payments below $14,000 and still remain hidden, even if they total more than the threshold., That allows a large proportion of financing to remain hidden from the public. The Centre for Public Integrity and the ACF both estimate the amount of unsourced money – known as dark money – at $100m in 2018-19., “This paper shows that both major parties are dependent on donations from the fossil-fuel lobby,” the ACF report concluded. “Not only this, but our major parties and their fundraising entities are responsible for a large sum of dark money in our system., “With poor requirements for reporting donations, there is little transparency to hold donors and parties to account.”, The federal donations system has remained weak even as state governments have progressed towards transparency. NSW, Victoria and Queensland require donations above $1,000 to be disclosed. The donations are reported to the public in near real-time., But federally, donations are disclosed only once a year, in February, making it impossible for the public to understand donors’ attempts to influence politics at any single point.fossil fuel industry doubles donations to major parties in four years report shows", "label": 0}, "train-286": {"text": "\nThe mattress landfill crisis: how the race to bring us better beds led to a recycling nightmare\n, \nThe mattress landfill crisis: how the race to bring us better beds led to a recycling nightmare\n, As the sleep economy grows, online companies vie to sell us new mattresses, offering 100-day returns. This has helped create an impossible waste mountain – and a wild west of rogue recyclers, \nSirin Kale, \n\nWed 12 Feb 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2020 04.34 EST\n\n, Mike Scollick and Richard Allsopp are talking about the worst things they ever found in a mattress. “We had one where I think a dog had been lying on it, and the whole thing was just jumping with fleas,” Allsopp says, shuddering. No one would touch it, so they had to use a cherry picker to move it. But that’s not the worst of it, Scollick says: “I stripped the cover off one once and it looked like somebody …” “Died,” interjects Allsopp., It’s fair to say you need a strong stomach to be in the mattress recycling game. Which Scollick and Allsopp have, along with several million pounds’ worth of equipment in their Coventry warehouse. I have come to see Circom, their mattress recycling firm, at work. It’s a dirty but noble enterprise: Circom is one of only a handful of recyclers tackling the UK’s ever-growing mattress problem., The UK threw away more than 7m mattresses in 2017, the vast majority of which went straight to landfill. Zero Waste Scotland has estimated that if the 600,000 mattresses Scotland throws away every year were stacked on top of each other, the pile would be more than 100 times taller than Ben Nevis. Flytipping is another huge area of concern: English councils spend £58m a year on clear-up, with mattresses among the most commonly illegally dumped items. According to the National Bed Federation (NBF), only about 19% of mattresses are recycled. The reason? They are a nightmare to recycle – it’s the springs. “They’re a machine killer,” says Scollick., And it’s not just a British problem. Mattresses are a global environmental nightmare. The US throws away 18.2m mattresses a year, but there are only 56 facilities available to recycle them., Changing consumer behaviour is behind this ever-growing mattress mountain. Time was, you would change your mattress every eight to 10 years. But with online retailers offering more choice than ever, we have learned to expect better mattresses, and to replace them more frequently., The development of roll-down technology – which allows mattresses to be packed into small, easily shippable boxes – has led to a plethora of start-ups targeting a $30bn international market. There are now at least 175 companies that will ship roll-down mattresses to your front door; one of the first movers in this space, the US firm Casper, was valued at $1.1bn in 2019. , Most of these start-ups offer 100-day comfort guarantees, during which consumers can return their mattresses for a full refund if for any reason they are not up to scratch. Some, such as the US’s Nectar, even offer a 365-day guarantee. Theoretically, consumers can cycle between these providers for high-quality mattresses at no cost: a Wall Street Journal reporter recently calculated that if she took advantage of all the offers available, she would be able to sleep on a free mattress for eight years., There is evidence that some consumers are gaming the system. A standard mattress retailer would aim for a return rate of less than 5%, says Jessica Alexander, of the NBF. “I’ve heard of 20% return rates, or even more, for some of these online retailers,” she adds. Not all consumers are behaving selfishly: some may be genuinely dissatisfied with their purchase. “The traditional way of buying a mattress was to go into a shop, lie down, discuss your needs with a salesperson, then buy a mattress,” Alexander says. With the online companies, “people are buying them, finding they weren’t as comfortable as they hoped, and sending them back”., That was the case for Cara (not her real name), a 26-year-old marketing executive from Florida. “I probably wouldn’t have bought a mattress without the guarantee,” she says. She bought a $900 mattress in 2018, before returning it for a full refund. “Ultimately, it just wasn’t that much more comfortable than my old mattress, which I had held on to just in case. I didn’t realise that returning it would mean that it was going to be potentially thrown out. If I’d known that, I probably would have hesitated about buying it.”, Some online providers have arrangements with care homes or hospitals to collect lightly used mattresses, re-cover them, and put them back into use. Others send them for recycling. But many will, inevitably, end up in landfill. “We’ve introduced a disposable mattress business model at a time when we probably should be moving in the exact opposite direction,” says Alexander., It is difficult to recycle the materials in a mattress because they aren’t worth much on the secondary market. “A lot of people would feel that there’s value in the materials in a mattress,” says David Fitzsimons, of the circular-economy experts Oakdene Hollins. “But, generally, that’s not true.” You may be able to get a few pounds for the metal springs in a mattress, but it’s hard to find takers for the foam and fibre., Back at Circom, Allsopp and Scollick recycle about 60% of the materials in the mattresses they process, and hope to eventually get that up to 100%. (The 40% that isn’t currently recycled is processed to be used as fuel.) Loosening the regulations around fibre and foam would be a big help, so they can be reused in the same way that old carpets are processed for horse stabling., As we tour the Circom plant, Allsopp asks me not to go into too much detail about the processes, lest its competitors steal their trade secrets. He needn’t have worried – you’d need an engineering degree to describe a machinery system this complex. And I’m a literature graduate., Suffice to say, there is an enormous crusher that crunches the mattresses, before belching them into a series of chutes that suck the detritus out like a big vacuum cleaner, separating it into fibre and foam. At some point, magnets are involved, but they have to be kept up high so they don’t destroy your mobile phone. The steel blades of the crusher have to be replaced every few weeks because they wear out so fast – there is an employee whose job it is to weld the blades to make them more durable., I watch transfixed as a cherry-picker operator feeds mattresses into the machine as if they were fruit being fed into a blender. As the machine chomps bulky mattresses down in seconds, I think: this would be an excellent place to get rid of a body., Many companies claim to recycle mattresses. But by no means all operate legitimately. “We do everything according to the law,” says Allsopp. He is a matter-of-fact, gruff presence. “We like the law.” Unfortunately, Scollick notes: “Wherever waste is, there’s criminality somewhere.”, The pair encounter criminals on a regular basis: they call the warehouse, asking for mattresses for resale, or if they have any leftover foam they can purchase. You can spot the fraudsters easily, because they’ll email from Gmail or Hotmail accounts, or call on mobiles. Allsopp says: “I have to be careful about what I say; I don’t want to start naming people because, basically, I’m frightened of them. I don’t want to wake up one morning and find that this place” – he gestures at the building – “is on fire.”, One scam involves fraudsters posing as reputable mattress recyclers. They set up an official-looking website and start offering their services to residents and businesses. When people bite, the fraudsters collect the mattresses, pick the ones in good condition, replace the outer casing, and then wrap in new covers that often have the logo of a reputable manufacturer on it. These secondhand mattresses are then sold as new. “Some of the mattresses you get from the general public are disgusting,” warns Allsopp. “If you strip the outer polycotton layer off a mattress, underneath it’s just a horror,” Scollick agrees. “That, unsanitised, is going into supposedly brand-new mattresses.”, It is easy to fall victim to mattress scammers: a member of Fitzsimons’ own family was duped. “I was agog!” he says. “In spite of all my stories over the dinner table!” A common scam involves a man with a van – often with the name of a reputable firm on the side – who goes door-to-door in residential neighbourhoods. He was meant to be delivering mattresses to a hotel, he’ll say, but there was a problem with the order, and they have surplus, high-quality mattresses. There’s no space back at the warehouse. Would you like to purchase them cheaply? “It works because people can’t resist a bargain, and don’t ask questions,” Fitzsimons says., To reassure anxious customers that it’s all legitimate, salesmen will sometimes issue professional-looking paperwork, with false contact details. “These carefully wrapped mattresses are made to look as new, sometimes with fake branding and fire-resistant labels, when they are often actually worn-out, dirty and unhygienic mattresses destined for the tip,” says councillor David Renard, of the Local Government Association. “These mattresses generally fail fire safety tests,” he adds. “Many victims won’t realise they have been conned and could be sleeping on a potential death trap.”, Allsopp and Scollick have visited the warehouses from which the scammers operate. It is common for workers to run the minute they see them, mistaking them for Environment Agency officials. (It’s the hi-vis jackets.) When they get inside the warehouses, it’s a grim affair. “They were just spraying glue,” says Allsopp of one rogue operator they stumbled across. “The smell from the glue – you were as high as a kite.” In addition to the sites being illegal and unsafe, they possibly use trafficked workers. “A lot of the staff don’t speak English, so you’re wondering if anything is wrong there,” says Scollick., The mattresses these criminals can’t resell, they fly-tip – Circom has had mattresses dumped outside its warehouse – or dump in landfill. In some cases, fraudsters have been known to rent a shed from an unsuspecting landlord, fill it to the brim with mattresses – and scarper. “There are loads of fake companies out there filling up sheds,” agrees Ray Bagnall, of Matt UK, another mattress recycler. “Dumping them on farms in Sussex or Essex.” He was recently called to clear out a shed full of thousands of mattresses in Snowdonia., Our ever-growing used mattress problem is also being exported. In July 2019, 100 containers of British waste were found in the port of Colombo, Sri Lanka. They had been illegally sent there, under the guise of metal recycling. Allsopp pulls up a photograph of the containers on his computer. “If you look at what’s in there, those are baled mattresses,” he says, pointing to the screen. Many of the mattresses appear to be wrapped in distinctive green packaging. “Those are the green bags that national retailers use to take mattresses back under their return scheme,” Allsopp says. Which means that mattresses that were sent for recycling by major retailers have been illegally dumped in a foreign country., The authorities are aware of the criminality in the industry, but don’t have the resources or political wherewithal to deal with it. “It’s the wild west at the moment,” says Alexander. “Yes, there are a number of good mattress-recycling facilities out there, but they’re limited.” The Local Government Association would like to see tougher criminal penalties on flytipping, as well as more manufacturers offering take-back services for old mattresses., Without action from regulators, the industry is trying to self-regulate. The National Bed Federation has a code of practice and accreditation system for genuine mattress recyclers: it audits facilities to check firms are compliant with the law and there’s no exploitation of their workforce. The organisation also aims to divert 75% of new mattresses sold from landfill by 2028, and is encouraging manufacturers to consider eco-friendly designs, such as reusable mattresses that would be leased to consumers for a period of time, before being sent back, stripped and refreshed., For now, though, it seems likely that mattress scamming will continue unchecked. Until that changes, consumers would do well to be wary of the fake mattresses flooding the market. Beware the man with a van and a winning smile., • This article was amended on 12 February 2020.

The real costs are probably much higher. This is the first attempt to make such a comprehensive assessment, so this is a preliminary estimate,” she said., She said the authors had been unable to make an estimate of the cost of remedial action to repair the damage to ecosystems, as there were too many variables, but that such estimates might be possible in future studies., Most climate change assessments up to now have focused on the funds needed to mitigate a rise in global temperatures of 1.5C., The Stern report, written by the UK economist Lord Stern in 2006, found that cutting carbon emissions to limit temperature increases would cost 1% of GDP annually, but ignoring climate change could cause economic damage up to an estimated 20% of GDP., The WWF study, which was produced in partnership with the Global Trade Analysis Project at Purdue University and the Natural Capital Project in the US, covered 140 countries., The UK could be one of the worst-hit countries, behind only the US and Japan, with annual costs from lost natural services that would equal the current combined yearly funding for the police, fire services, prisons and law courts., The main economic costs for Britain would be through the loss of habitats that form natural coastal protection systems and homes for marine life, such as seagrass beds, reefs and saltmarsh., That would lead to flooding and erosion as well as declining fish stocks harming the fishing industry, WWF said.global economic growth will take big hit due to loss of nature", "label": 0}, "train-288": {"text": "\nCountry diary: mistletoe's moon pearls are full of marvellous jelly\n, Marshwood Vale, Dorset: On a sunny day three Februarys ago, I squashed the berries on to an apple branch.

There it was – a tiny wishbone with a pair of propeller-shaped leaf blades reaching up and out towards the sun. The first shoot of a new mistletoe plant., Mistletoe (Viscum album) takes a long time to establish. Four Christmases ago, I saved some berries to ripen, a handful of rubbery moon pearls salvaged from the darkest days of winter. They need light or they die, so I put them in a jam jar next to the spider-webbed window of the garden shed., Mistletoe berries are technically drupes: a kernel within a shell encased in flesh beneath a skin, like cherries or plums. The skin is filled with jelly, inside which floats the seed, a flattish green heart netted in silver membrane. Pop one and the gel spurts out, smelling faintly of ripe pears. When birds eat mistletoe they wipe their sticky beaks on the tree, gluing seeds to its bark., On a sunny day three Februarys ago, I squashed the ripe berries on to an apple tree branch. That March, crooked shoots emerged. They were like bent pins, folding downwards towards the wood. Summer came and I forgot about them., When mistletoe germinates it produces a stem, which bends down and forms a sucker on the wood. This holdfast sends roots running underneath the bark, producing a swelling of woody tissue, a meld of tree and mistletoe, through which the mistletoe sucks nutrients. I didn’t realise that from the outside there might be nothing to see at this stage., Buying mistletoe later that year, I checked to see how long it would be before I had homegrown kisses to hang. But the branch was bare, so I assumed the seeds had died. Clearing under the tree the next spring, I was amazed to discover new sproutings., Two years on from then, those sprigs have formed three determined, seaweedy clumps. Mistletoe plants are either male or female and both sexes are needed for the females to produce berries. I won’t know until they flower what I’ve got.

The wildfires have been one of the most damaging in the country’s history – more than 11m hectares (27m acres) have burned, killing 33 people and decimating wildlife populations., But they are just the latest in a succession of destructive blazes that have been flaring across the planet – even in the Arctic circle – in the past five years. The response from authorities, in Australia, the Americas and the Mediterranean often seems scrambled and ineffective., So what is to be done? Fire experts point to a host of techniques that can help prevent fires before they have even started. These range from deliberate off-season blazes designed to manage the landscape to using grazing animals to reduce flammable material, as well as requiring people to remove trees and brush that are too close to homes., Much of it draws on how our distant ancestors co-existed with forests and using agroforestry., The first thing to acknowledge is that firefighting doesn’t work with mega fires and probably never will, says Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London. He says pictures of air tankers are just “good PR” for politicians., “We are almost fighting fires as we were 100 years ago except now we have bigger planes. All firefighters can do is protect the path of the fire and evacuate people. You have to wait for rain or wind to stop it.” , Rather than being a show of strength, firefighting should be seen as a last resort used only when preventive methods have failed, says Rein. Growing up in Spain, he was told that all fires were bad but after studying them he realised the importance of “good fires”., We are almost fighting fires as we were 100 years ago except now we have bigger planes, “If we suppress all fires we are literally stopping life on Earth,” Rein says. “Wildfires were created by nature and they have well-recognised benefits – fire regulates the carbon cycle and has shaped all ecosystems known to man except Antarctica. The number one thing we can do to stop megafires is to create a natural fire regime.”, Counterintuitively, this involves burning more fires, using a technique called prescribed burns – intentional off-season fires that burn up leaves and old wood and create breaks in the forest. Indigenous people know this and have been regenerating forests using fire-stick farming for thousands of years, but much of that knowledge has been lost now., Fires made out of season are often referred to as “cold fires”. They do not burn the canopy of trees, which means insects and other animals can take refuge without getting scorched. Many forests are reliant on fire to decompose dead wood and old leaves that otherwise lie on the forest floor. Some “phoenix plants” can only be regenerated by fire – sequoias, for instance, require fire to break open their cones so their seeds can spread., Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?, This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come., Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com, “Our fire management techniques in California are probably similar to those in Canada, Australia and the Mediterranean,” says Garrett Dickman, a biologist who has worked in forest management in Yosemite national park for 11 years. “It’s pretty simple in that you only have a handful of management tools – you’re either using fire, or you can use mechanical means. You can use livestock grazing too, which works pretty well in grass ecosystems.”, Fire management strategies vary in different countries – very generally, forests closer to the equator should have more wildfires and those farther away should have fewer. There are obvious exceptions such as the Amazon rainforest, which straddles the equator and should naturally have very few fires (tropical forests are normally too humid to sustain fires for long and their trees are not designed to withstand them)., Many US fire-suppression policies were created following devastating wildfires in the summer of 1910 (the “big blowup”) that ravaged large parts of Idaho, Montana and Washington. Forest rangers and ecologists understand the role of fires in shaping forests, but politicians have inherited this 100-year-old aversion to fire., There are signs this is slowly starting to change., In California the amount of land allocated for prescribed burns has doubled between 2013 and 2018. About 19,000 hectares are burnt each year, but experts say that number needs to be far higher. Concerns about smoke pollution and the liability associated if something goes wrong discourage landowners from preemptive action., Following a spate of fires in California between 2017 and 2019, there has been an effort to get rid of the barriers to prescribed burns, including removing liability for landowners and creating education programmes to help people understand their importance, though it is yet to be seen if these policies will be effective., Grazing animals help remove “fuel” from the forest floor and create natural breaks in woodland. Agroforestry systems – grazing animals and/or growing crops in forests – are part of cultural landscapes in Europe that are hundreds of years old. Having more people managing forests meant that small fires were less likely to get out of control. Because of lower population densities in North America and Australia, subsistence farming has had a less marked impact on forests., The slow decline of agroforestry was one of the factors that made the deadly 2017 wildfires in Portugal so destructive. Another issue is that ageing rural landowners – who often live next to forests – are not so active in clearing up brush from around their homes. The country also has large plantations of fast-growing (and flammable) eucalyptus trees grown to supply the country’s significant paper pulp industry, which may have exacerbated the problem., However, small changes are starting to happen – authorities are seeking to reduce eucalyptus cultivation and plant more fire-resistant oak and chestnut trees. Rural properties are now required to clear undergrowth within 50 metres (164 feet) of houses., A four-year study looking at land use in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain found that grazing animals were effective at reducing wildfires. “I get the impression that wildfires would still happen, but agroforestry is a way of minimising them,” says Dr Paul Burgess, a reader in crop ecology and management at the Cranfield Soil and Agrifood Institute, who helped write the study published in Agroforestry Systems., But some are frustrated that these policies aren’t being created faster. Greece, whose islands and coasts have been hit by increasingly ferocious fires, faced tough criticism of its firefighting system after Mati, a resort town east of Athens, was consumed by an inferno that left 103 dead in 2018., Following the tragedy, the European parliament called for tougher policies of prevention to be applied across the continent. “There were lessons to be drawn from Mati, but so far they have not been reflected in political action,” said Elias Tziritis, a forest fire specialist at WWF Greece. “There has to be a lot more emphasis on forest management and prevention of fires, a lot more focus on thinking ahead and not what should happen when a fire actually occurs.”, People involved in EU land use policy are starting to recognise the importance of farming and forestry: agroecology and agroforestry have been identified as key sustainable agricultural practices in the European Green Deal, which commits at least 40% of the common agricultural policy budget to climate action., Burgess says: “In terms of agroforestry I think there’s an increasing appetite for integrated land management. In the context of Brexit there are more opportunities for it, too, which will also improve biodiversity, carbon storage, windbreaks and reduce soil erosion. It’s something the government is keen to look at, and I think we’re moving that way.”, Marc Castellnou, an incident commander in the Catalan fire service who is also a fire analyst at the University of Lleida, says wildfires are essentially a problem of land management and rural policies., “We’re starting to realise that climate change isn’t just going to affect temperatures and sea levels – it’s also going to change landscapes on a global scale. The land as we have known it is not going to stay the same because the climate is changing. That is going to mean different policies when it comes to water and farming,” he said., Indigenous people knew the art of forest management but much of that knowledge has been lost. Martin Kealy, a chartered fire consultant and managing director of MKA Fire, says: “It’s an art that would have been practised for thousands of years but when the Brits came and took over Australia, that knowledge was lost. The same happened in the US., “These wildfires have been going on for hundreds if not thousands of years. It’s not something new and these fires will continue for hundreds or thousands of years – we just need to manage the land,” he said., Additional reporting by Sam Jones in Madrid and Helena Smith in Athens, This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

You need a business case for the offtake, and the business case for the offtake needs to be protected against any change of law, including a carbon tax.”, Offtake agreements are contracts between power generators and customers., Indemnities mean that taxpayers, not private developers, wear the risk of any change of policy. The Ai Group argued in 2018 that net present value of fully offsetting the lifetime emissions of a new 2GW “high-efficiency low-emissions” power plant could be $17.5bn, and more than $1.3bn annually by 2030, depending on what carbon policies were ultimately adopted., With the Collinsville project sparking sharp divisions between Liberals, who argue the government should play no role in the development, and Nationals, who are pressuring Morrison to support it, St Baker queried whether there was actually a sound business case for the plant., He noted there was “a surplus already in north Queensland”. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) noted in 2018 there was an “energy surplus” in north Queensland, and “further large-scale generator connections are unlikely to be efficient in north Queensland until existing thermal generation in central Queensland starts to retire” in the 2030s., He said the principal proponent of the Collinsville development within government, the former resources minister Matt Canavan, was “a Queensland senator” and might be pushing the development as a means of attracting new jobs to Queensland., But he queried who the customers for the power might be, given the energy surplus, and he speculated the principal customer might be Adani. “There must be a new load behind this. Is that Galilee Basin coalmines? Who else? A bit of it might be Copper Link. That’s under hot negotiation at the moment.”, St Baker, a Liberal National party donor who maintains a substantial political network, has two generation projects that the Morrison government might underwrite through a program that aims to support new investment in power generation. One is a coal upgrade at Vales Point at Lake Macquarie. St Baker is also the proponent of a pumped hydro project in South Australia., He says he has not sought an indemnity for his Vales Point coal upgrade because the investment is small-scale and the operating life is comparatively short., After the government confirmed at the weekend it would support a feasibility study looking at the project, Morrison was asked by Labor in parliament on Tuesday whether he was prepared to give the Collinsville project a taxpayer indemnity from carbon risk., Morrison stepped around the question from the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, saying that matter was “not currently before the government”., While many Liberals are strongly opposed to the government supporting coal developments, in 2018, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, held open the option of providing indemnities, telling Guardian Australia the government would look to remove the risks stopping investment in new power generation., “I’m saying we will look at whatever risks that can’t be managed by the companies that need to be managed to get investment,” Taylor said., “What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing. We need the investment.”trevor st baker says collinsville coal plant would need shielding from climate policy change", "label": 0}, "train-291": {"text": "'Triple whammy': drought, fires and floods push Australian rivers into crisis, The combination of extreme weather events will have cascading impacts on fish, platypus and invertebrates, threatening some with extinction, Australia’s rivers are being hit by a “triple whammy” of impacts that will have serious and long-term effects on species and could push some to extinction, according to experts., Drought, bushfires in river catchments and now widespread heavy rain in the east of the country have created a cascade of impacts on fish, invertebrates and platypus., Prof Ross Thompson, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Canberra’s Institute for Applied Ecology, said: “There’s a real risk of losing species that we have not even gotten around to describing yet.”, In New South Wales, thousands of fish have died in recent weeks in the Murray-Darling Basin and in coastal areas. Some of the mass fish kills were likely caused by the drought, while in other parts of the state ash flowing into rivers from bushfire areas has been blamed., Low flows have caused a fish kill in the Brodribb River in Victoria’s East Gippsland, the ABC reported, with contractors pulling 1,200kg of dead fish from the water., Sudden downpours running over parched river beds can stir up sediments that are carried downstream. Ash and mud washing into rivers from burned landscapes can increase bacteria growth in the water, which in turn starves the fish and other organisms of oxygen., Thompson said: “The reality is that this combination of events have not been experienced by our fauna before, so the risk of things being extinct or being dramatically reduced is high.”, Thompson has studied the impacts of previous droughts and bushfires on freshwater systems. When the millennium drought broke, Thompson said, the downpours acted as “another disturbance” to species, rather than a welcome relief., “Floods that come after droughts have really big impacts on aquatic biota,” he said. But with this summer’s addition of the extensive bushfires in river catchments, “we have a triple whammy this time”., He said a study around the Murrumbidgee river after Canberra’s fires of 2003 had shown just how much sediment could be released into rivers from burnt catchments., “There were pools in that river that were 5m deep that got completely filled in,” he said. Sediment tended to smother food sources that were on the river beds., Thompson was particularly concerned about species such as the stocky galaxias – the subject of a rescue effort in the Kosciuszko national park – and the endangered Macquarie perch. He said a broader concern was that rivers might not get the 30 or 40 years they needed to recover before the next big disturbance., Asked if climate change was playing a role, he said: “The combination of drought, increased intensity of fires and extreme rainfall events, particularly in summer, is entirely consistent with what we have been modelling and predicting.”, On the Macleay river, near Kempsey, hundreds of thousands of fish died after heavy rain upstream flushed ash and debris into the river, turning it into what one local described as “runny cake mix”., One ecologist said it could take decades for the Macleay river to recover from the event., Prof Fran Sheldon, of the Australian Rivers Institute, said adding so much ash and sediment into the rivers turned them into the aquatic equivalent of “deserts” because the bacteria sucked the oxygen from the water. “Most organisms can’t survive so they just disappear.”, Prof Max Finlayson, of the Institute for Land, Water and Society at Charles Sturt University, told Guardian Australia that while the individual impacts on rivers such as floods, droughts and bushfires were “not new phenomena”, it was the combination of impacts – together with the scale of the fires – that was “the big difference”., “We have hammered these streams and lakes and they’re already under pressure from land clearing, development, pollution and changes to flows. The remnant populations of species are now subjected across a large area to a bigger threat. It’s extending the problems in a big and nasty way., “Some of these fish are under a lot of pressure with remnant populations in isolated places. In any one area we would, in any one year, lose populations anyway, but if you lose them over a large area then it’s the actual species that’s at risk.”, Prof Lee Baumgartner, also at Charles Sturt University, said he had been in more than a dozen teleconference calls with fellow freshwater scientists and the No 1 issue was the impacts on rivers from bushfires., “Everyone is very concerned about it,” he said. There had been rescue efforts of individual species, he said, that could provide an insurance policy for some species. Even if only one or two of the longer-lived fish survived, they were able to lay thousands of eggs at a time., Sheldon, Baumgartner and Finlayson all told Guardian Australia that studying the state of the rivers and how they respond to the current crisis would be critical for informing conservation efforts in coming years., Sheldon said: “Understanding the recovery is going to be very important for us as we manage these rivers into the future.”, Finlayson added: “Right now there’s not a lot we can do. But we will be in the same situation again next year. We need to assess which areas should be prioritised and why – that is about our biodiversity values and human-use values., “We need actions, not just talk. We are at high risk of not just losing populations but whole species. Once we lose them, they are gone.”triple whammy hits push australian rivers crisis", "label": 0}, "train-292": {"text": "\nFossil fuel pollution behind 4m premature deaths a year – study\n, Burning gas, coal and oil costs global economy $8bn a day and particularly harms children , \nMatthew Taylor, \n\nTue 11 Feb 2020 22.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2020 22.07 EST\n\n, Air pollution from burning fossil fuels is responsible for more than 4m premature deaths around the world each year and costs the global economy about $8bn a day, according to a study., The report, from Greenpeace Southeast Asia and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, found that burning gas, coal and oil causes three times the number of deaths as road traffic accidents globally., Children, especially those living in low-income countries, are particularly affected with an estimated 40,000 dying each year before they reach their fifth birthday because of exposure to particulate pollution from fossil fuels., “Air pollution is a threat to our health and our economies,” said Minwoo Son, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia., “Every year, air pollution from fossil fuels takes millions of lives, increases our risk of stroke, lung cancer and asthma, and costs us trillions of dollars.”, The study, released on Wednesday, analysed global datasets of surface level concentrations of common pollutants PM2.5, ozone and NO2 to calculate the health impact and the subsequent economic cost for 2018., It found:, NO2, from petrol and diesel vehicles, power plants and factories, is linked to roughly 4m new cases of asthma in children each year. Approximately 16 million children live with the condition due to exposure to fossil fuel pollution., Tiny particulate pollution – known as PM2.5 – is attributed to roughly 1.8bn days of work absence because of illness each year., China, the US and India are hardest-hit financially by the impact of dirty air with estimated costs of $900bn, $600bn and $150bn each year respectively., The study argues that the solutions to the air pollution crisis are clear – and would also help tackle the climate emergency., It says moving to a clean energy and transport system would have economic as well as health benefits. It cites research published in the US recently by the Environmental Protection Agency that shows every $1 invested under the US Clean Air Act yielded at least $30 in return., Likewise, a weekly car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, yielded up to $4 in health benefits for every $1 invested., “This is a problem that we know how to solve,” said Son. “By transitioning to renewable energy sources, phasing out diesel and petrol cars, and building public transport.

The past five years and the past decade are the hottest in 150 years of record-keeping, an indication of the gathering pace of the climate crisis., According to Noaa, the average global land and ocean surface temperature last month was 2.05F (or 1.14C) above the 20th-century average. This measurement marginally surpassed the previous January record, set in 2016., A pulse of unusual warmth was felt across much of Russia, Scandinavia and eastern Canada, where temperatures were an incredible 9F (5C) above average, or higher. The Swedish town of Örebro reached 10.3C, its hottest January temperature since 1858, while Boston experienced its hottest ever January day, at 23C (74F)., Meanwhile, the Antarctic has begun February with several temperature spikes.

It released 206m gallons of oil from BP’s Macondo well, according to US government estimates, affecting wildlife and water-quality along hundreds of miles of Gulf coastline., At its height, 88,522 sq miles of sea were closed to fishing because of the spill, according to a federal report., But a new study published on Thursday in the Science Advances journal says satellite surveillance at the time was unable to detect large areas of oil contamination., The study’s authors found that the effects of the spill were 30% larger, reaching the Texas shore, the Florida Keys, the coast of Tampa and parts of the east coast of Florida. “The satellite footprint does not necessarily capture the entire oil spill extent,” the study found., Using in-situ observations, oil spill transport modeling using three-dimensional computer simulations, as well as testing for oil concentration ranges in marine organisms, the paper claims that “that large areas of the GoM were exposed to invisible and toxic oil that extended beyond the boundaries of the satellite footprint and the fishery closures”., “When the oil comes to the surface, it comes as a thick layer that you can easily see with a satellite,” Claire Paris-Limouzy, one of the study’s authors and a professor of ocean sciences at the University of Miami, told CNN., The discrepancy between their results and official estimates is because small concentrations of oil are often invisible to satellite imagery. “You can actually smell it but can’t actually see it,” Paris-Limouzy said., London-based BP, which leased the rig from Transocean, declined to comment on the study’s findings., A Transocean report into the disaster largely blamed BP, claiming the company failed to properly assess, manage and communicate risk, and said cement contractor Halliburton and BP did not adequately test the cement slurry used to seal the well., BP’s own internal report placed blame on a cascade of failures by multiple companies. A US government investigation also identified multiple sources for the accident., BP subsequently spent or committed tens of billions of dollars to clean up the mess and compensate victims, and ultimately sold off its US arm. Transocean reached a $211m settlement with businesses and individuals claiming damages, while Halliburton reached a $1bn settlement., A bipartisan investigatory commission appointed by the Obama administration pointed to crew and technical failures in the explosion, but cited overall safety shortcomings by regulators and the oil industry., But safeguards in place to prevent a similar accident in future have been progressively eased by the Trump administration’s push to expand drilling off the country’s coasts., ﻿The new assessment of the Macondo spill’s extent is timely, the authors wrote, because “with a global increase in petroleum production–related activities, a careful assessment of oil spills’ full extent is necessary to maximize environmental and public safety”.deepwater horizon disaster oil worse impact study finds", "label": 0}, "train-298": {"text": "\nAlok Sharma appointed president of Cop26 climate conference\n, Surprise choice has poor record on Commons votes affecting the environment, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nThu 13 Feb 2020 10.16 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 13 Feb 2020 08.07 EST\n\n, Alok Sharma, the former international development secretary, is the surprise choice to take on the role of president of the crunch UN climate talks to be hosted by the UK this November., He has also been made business secretary as part of Boris Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle., Sharma has garnered praise from campaigners for his role at the Department for International Development, but will face an uphill task after nearly two weeks of trouble surrounding the post of Cop26 president., The former energy minister Claire O’Neill was abruptly sacked from the role and unleashed a vitriolic attack on Johnson, while several other high-profile figures including David Cameron and William Hague turned down the role., Sharma has a mixed record on voting on green issues in parliament. The Guardian’s Polluters project scored MPs on how they swung on a range of key votes. Sharma scored only 15%, a poor showing, as he was present for 13 votes affecting climate and environmental issues, but voted positively on only two of them., Since 2010 he has been MP for Reading West, to the west of London and just over 20 miles from Heathrow, and he has both opposed and publicly favoured Heathrow expansion., TheyWorkForYou, which rates MPs on their voting records, found he “generally voted against measures to prevent climate change”., In the record of MPs’ interests, he has received a donation of £15,000 from Offshore Group Newcastle, which makes platforms for oil, gas and wind energy companies., However, he has used his role at DfID to promote action on the climate crisis, by assisting developing countries to improve their resilience to the impacts of extreme weather, and tackling issues such as deforestation and clean energy. Last October, he urged the World Bank to focus more of its funding on the climate crisis., Mohamed Adow, director of energy and climate at thinktank Power Shift Africa, said: “It’s a relief to finally have a Cop president in post. But now the hard work must start. For such a crucial summit it’s worrying that Alok Sharma takes up the reins with only nine months to go. He will need all the resources of government and the diplomatic service to ensure the UK Cop is not a failure., “This is the UK’s first real test post-Brexit and so far Britain has not looked like a serious player on the global stage. The eyes of the world are watching and the UK’s Commonwealth allies in Africa and around the world will be demanding an outcome that sees those of us on the front lines of the climate crisis protected.”, Sharma will be expected to combine the Cop26 role with the job of business secretary, one of the key roles in cabinet, especially as the government wrestles with Brexit. Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, asked whether they were compatible. “Can Alok Sharma serve as both business secretary and president of the UK’s biggest global climate summit? The presidency isn’t like a student picking up a few extra bar shifts, it’s about leading the world’s climate ambition during a crucial time for the environment,” she told the Guardian. “We cannot afford a part-time president.” , Kat Kramer, global climate lead at the charity Christian Aid, said Sharma faced a “grave and delicate” task but could take advantage of his business secretary role to ensure the UK presented itself as a credible leader in the climate fight, through a national plan of action for reaching net zero emissions., She said: “It would have been a big task had Alok Sharma been in post from the beginning, rather than coming in late in the process. It’s now vital he work very closely with the backing of the prime minister to both get other countries to commit to new pledges to tackle the climate crisis but also put the UK’s own house in order and enact policies to accelerate UK decarbonisation. As secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, Sharma will be well placed to oversee this.”, Several ministers had been mooted for the role, including Michael Gove, who told a conference on Tuesday there were “many, many, many, many” people who would do better as Cop26 president, such as Zac Goldsmith and Kwasi Kwarteng, the clean energy minister., Gove hesitated when asked what would make the summit a success, before answering that success would be for countries to “accept the need to change and that leads to irreversible, accelerating and inclusive action” on the climate crisis., That falls well short of requiring governments to come forward with concrete new plans on cutting carbon in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement, which is what activists and supportive countries such as the EU are hoping for., The job was turned down by former prime minister Cameron, who is said to have been too busy, and former foreign secretary Hague, who is believed to have had concerns about the role. Their reluctance suggests a perceived low standing for the role, which will not help the new incumbent., Previous Cop summits have tended to be led by the host government’s most prominent minister with a relevant portfolio, usually the environment minister. , France signalled its determination to forge a new global agreement in Paris by appointing Laurent Fabius, then foreign secretary, who led a tireless round of visits to foreign capitals in his military jet, while also getting other major figures such as Ségolène Royal closely involved in the intensive diplomacy. The then French president, François Hollande, also played a leading role., If Cop26 is to be a success – and so far the government has promised success but set a low bar for what that might look like – then Sharma will need to be able to call on the international firepower of the whole government, and Johnson will have to shake up every major department to come forward with domestic plans to prove the UK is on the road to net zero.alok sharma appointed chair of cop26 climate conference in reshuffle", "label": 0}, "train-299": {"text": "\nWhat are the tasks facing Alok Sharma as new Cop26 president?\n, As governments dither and emissions rise, pressure will be on UK at UN climate summit, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nThu 13 Feb 2020 09.19 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2020 11.50 EST\n\n, Alok Sharma, the new president of the Cop26 climate conference to be held in Glasgow in November, has experience of working closely with developing countries on the climate crisis in his former role as secretary for international development., This may be valuable in helping him forge the “grand coalition” that experts say is needed to break the deadlock on international climate action., The last round of UN climate talks, in Madrid last December, showed the massive task that Britain will face as host this year in trying to build consensus on the issue., While more than half a million protesters from around the world lined the streets of the Spanish capital, inside the conference centre government officials squinted at semicolons in a dense text on how countries can buy and sell carbon., For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC., The UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions., The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations., Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority., Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent, Two weeks of talks produced little more than a tetchy agreement to gather again this year for Cop26 (the 26th conference of the parties), with proposals for strengthening national plans to reduce emissions. Even that, in the context of the disasters that had threatened the talks, was better than some had feared., Since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, the willingness of governments to tackle the climate crisis has waned. Donald Trump’s election as US president was the biggest factor – he has called climate science a “hoax” and begun the process of withdrawing the US from the agreement. That withdrawal will not take legal effect until 4 November, the day after the next US election., Emboldened by Trump, other countries have also started to backslide. Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil, has embarked on a programme of exploitation of the Amazon, and in Madrid his officials worked hard to scupper any climate deal. They fought over details of an obscure clause of the Paris agreement governing carbon trading, which will now have to be resolved in Glasgow., Other countries were less vocal but no less inimical to progress. Saudi Arabia tried to hold up consensus, and Russia is also hostile to Paris. India, by siding with Brazil on carbon trading, bolstered the wreckers, but in other forums called for more urgent action under Paris., China’s stance was viewed as encouraging by Paris supporters, but it had little new to say. The EU made the boldest announcement, of a European green deal to transform the economy and reach net zero emissions by mid-century, but the details of its commitments are still subject to wrangling by member states., Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s top climate official, showed some frustration in her assessment. “We need to be clear that the conference did not result in agreement on the guidelines for a much-needed carbon market, an essential part of the toolkit to raise ambition. Developed countries have to fully address the calls from developed countries for finance, technology and capacity building, without which they cannot green their economies. High-emitting countries did not send a clear enough signal that they are ready to ramp up ambition.”, All of this leaves the UK with a diplomatic mess to sort out. At Cop26, countries are supposed to come forward with new plans for stringent emissions cuts, in line with the science. Time is running out for those new plans to take effect, and without strong signals from governments the required changes will not be made. Arguably, the task facing Sharma is even harder than negotiating the 2015 Paris accord – at least the French government could rely on Barack Obama’s support, and a US-China agreement was fundamental to the success of Paris., In the four years since Paris was signed, while governments have dithered, businesses have carried on investing in fossil fuels and emissions have risen by a further 4%. Climate science, meanwhile, has grown stronger: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world’s leading experts, said in 2018 that catastrophic climate breakdown would become inevitable within this decade unless the world changed course and started to bring global emissions down dramatically., “We need to really get across the point that this is not some minor adjustment that is required,” said Mary Robinson, the chair of the Elders, a campaigning group of senior world figures, and a former UN climate envoy. “The reality is that we need every company, every city, every country to be carbon neutral by 2050. If we can get that, then Cop26 really will be a game-changer.”what are tasks facing alok sharma new cop26 president", "label": 0}, "train-300": {"text": "\n'I've lost friends': the young climate strikers forced to go it alone\n, Activism can be lonely in rural areas, but social media lets lone children’s voices be amplified, \nJessica Murray, \n\nThu 13 Feb 2020 08.07 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2020 13.50 EST\n\n, In a remote village in north Norfolk, nine-year-old Amelia Bradbury has been standing alone outside her school gates every Friday for months. Like hundreds of thousands of young people across the world, she is following Greta Thunberg’s lead and campaigning for action on the climate crisis – but, far from any of the big city demonstrations, she’s having to go it alone., “I was quite scared the first time because no one was doing it with me,” says Amelia. “But I’m doing this because I care about something. I really want people to listen to me and to make a difference.”, She holds a handmade sign reading: “I’m striking for our nature”, and it is her passion for wildlife and the outdoors that keeps her going each week. On the weekends she volunteers for Norfolk Wildlife Trust with her family and enjoys birdwatching., Nevertheless, there are times when striking alone can be difficult. “It is quite hard in the cold, especially when it’s freezing,” she says. A few of her friends at school are interested, but their parents are not so sure – with only one person, it is hard to get the ball rolling., Although there are young people from all walks of life striking alone, it’s often those in rural areas who struggle to make themselves, and the issues they most care about, heard. Holly Gillibrand, 14, in Fort William has been striking for more than a year: “The bigger towns and cities get all this media attention, obviously, because a lot of people turn up., “But I think the media tend to forget about the people in the rural places around Scotland and the rest of the UK. We have a different perspective on things and our voices deserve to be put out there just as much as anyone else’s.”, But social media has provided a platform for rural voices to be amplified. In November Amelia’s father uploaded a video of her to Twitter after the prime minister, Boris Johnson, failed to show up to the climate leadership debate before the election. In it she said: “Tomorrow I’m going to be standing outside in the rain and you couldn’t be bothered to turn up in a warm studio to debate the other leaders. How pathetic are you?”, It generated more than 1,000 retweets and praise from the wildlife presenter Chris Packham. “It was a bit crazy but I feel really proud because it shows that people notice and care,” Amelia says., It was the power of social media that inspired Anna Kernahan, 17, Grace Maddrell, 14, and Helen Jackson, 21, to set up Solo But Not Alone, a Twitter page dedicated to sharing the stories of solo climate strikers., “People will say: ‘Oh, you’re not alone,’ but it’s hard to see that when you are sitting there at the strike and there’s no one else around you, everyone’s walking past,” says Anna. She strikes alone in Belfast from 12pm to 3pm every Friday, often reading a book or catching up on homework. Although she struggles to get friends to join her, she has one powerful supporter to keep her going – Greta Thunberg., “My phone crashes whenever she retweets me because she gets so many likes,” says Anna., Within weeks of setting up Solo But Not Alone at the end of 2019, the trio had hundreds of followers, and have been able to profile solo strikers across the globe., It has helped them connect with people such as Mulindwa Moses, a 23-year-old climate activist from Uganda who strikes alone on the roadside. At one point he did it for 55 days consecutively, but now just strikes on Fridays and Saturdays, raising awareness for the Save Congo Rainforest and Two Trees a Week campaigns., Moses was inspired to take action after speaking to people who had lost family members in landslides and floods, which he later found were being caused by the climate crisis. “There are literally no reports about the climate and ecological crisis in the media, which has kept the population ignorant, and leaders are taking advantage of this to not take action,” Mulindwa says., Living in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, he strikes alone not because he lives in an isolated area, but because of his country’s lack of tolerance for climate activism., “Being a climate activist in Uganda is very hard,” Mulindwa says. “You cannot hold a strike with large numbers to create awareness because the government does not allow it, and I have lost friends, who say they can no longer associate with me because I stand on the side of roads holding signs and spend most of my time planting trees.”, But like other solo climate strikers around the world, his loneliness is eased by the support he receives from fellow climate activists online. Anna says: “We really want to make sure that even if only one person is striking, their voice is heard and it is loud.”young climate strikers go it alone", "label": 0}, "train-301": {"text": "\nUK to lead global fight against illegal logging and deforestation\n, Plan to form coalition of developing countries at COP 26 to help support efforts , \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nThu 13 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2020 02.02 EST\n\n, The UK is to spearhead a major global crackdown on illegal timber and deforestation, with plans to form a coalition of developing countries against the trade as part of its hosting of crunch UN climate talks this year., Deforestation is a leading factor in rising global greenhouse gas emissions, but many developing nations lack the means and institutions to combat illegal logging and regulate forest industries. The Department for International Development (DfID) will shortly lay out plans to help countries strengthen the rule of law, support the trade in responsible forestry and provide on-the-ground assistance to stamp out illegal logging., “The illegal timber trade robs the earth of trees, which not only help stop climate change, they also play a critically important role in maintaining the world’s threatened biodiversity,” said Zac Goldsmith, a minister for international development. “This is a huge success story for the UK and for the world, and sets the scene for what we hope will be a successful year of international cooperation in the run-up to COP 26.”, The UK will need to form a global coalition of developing countries to put pressure on leading economies to act swiftly on carbon, if this year’s UN climate talks are to succeed. The UK will host the COP 26 talks in Glasgow in November, but the government has faced a troubled start to its presidency, with the abrupt sacking of the intended president, the former energy minister Claire O’Neill, and delays in setting out a clear plan., All countries are expected to come forward with tougher plans to reduce global emissions as part of COP 26, and experts have said this will only happen if the UK takes the lead in forming a coalition of small and big developing countries, including forested African nations and Indonesia, as well as major economies such as the US, China, India and the EU., Offering assistance to developing countries, in the form of finance and technical expertise, will be vital to that effort., Lord Goldsmith, who is rated by Ladbrokes as favourite to take over the reins of COP 26 in Boris Johnson’s expected reshuffle, pointed to some notable victories against deforestation so far. He said targeted intervention by the UK had recently led to an “extremely important” prosecution of a major illegal trading operator in Indonesia, and had encouraged China to strengthen its legal commitments to ending the trade., “These are vital steps towards making sure there is no safe harbour for illegal timber anywhere in the world,” he said. “The UK will continue to work with China, Indonesia and our other international partners to protect the world’s forests for future generations.”, The new project, still in the planning stages, will build on the government’s forests governance, markets and climate programme, the focus of which includes strengthening the rule of law in affected countries in the developing world, influencing international partners to increase their efforts, supporting responsible trade and helping stakeholders on the ground to act., The DfID also helps developing countries to access new technology in the fight against deforestation, including electronic wood tracking, which marks trees with digital barcodes that officials can scan at each stage of the supply chain, and a GPS-enabled smartphone app, to enable local communities to monitor and report illegal logging in real time., In 2005, only about a fifth of Indonesia’s timber trade was legal. But today, after interventions by the UK and other partners, 100% of exports are sourced from independently audited factories and forests., In Liberia, the programme helped forest communities to negotiate fair contracts with logging companies to stop illegal deforestation, and a new land rights act was signed into law which for the first time recognised women’s rights to land.uk lead global fight illegal logging deforestation cop 26", "label": 0}, "train-302": {"text": "\nCountry diary: far from upright, this character is a hero of the floodplain\n, Wenlock Edge, Shropshire: Britain’s black poplar is leaning towards extinction – but it could have a future in flood control, \nPaul Evans, \n\nThu 13 Feb 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, The tree leans into the light. As the sky darkens, the crown of a black poplar catches the gold of February sunlight. Big old black poplars, Populus nigra, are leaners. They are trees of European floodplain forests and when these leaning towers finally keel over, they grow shoots back up again from the wreckage, which will eventually fall to create new woods., Black poplars are slow walkers of the floodplain, water bailiffs holding the flow in the landscape. This one, growing in the valley of a tributary of the River Severn, is the British subspecies, P nigra betulifolia, the Atlantic race of European black poplars. , The Forestry Commission says there are only 7,000 true black poplars left in Britain. Floodplains are for development, and leaning trees are dangerous; the gnarly old giants, tumbling in slow motion through a world that no longer exists, are anachronisms. The drifts of cotton-woolly seeds that the black poplar produces are not popular – a 1990s survey found someone who blamed them for the failure of his business – which has been one reason why there are so few female trees left., Drainage, river channelling, intensive agriculture, building development, urbanisation, lack of legal protection, depleted genetic diversity, fragmentation of habitat and a shortage of information has the black poplar leaning towards extinction. Since the 19th century, imported hybrids have taken over its commercial viability for forestry plantation., The future for the black poplar is in climate adaptation: conserving flood water and wildlife species. Improvements in DNA testing can sort out the hybrids from the endangered native subspecies, and conservation measures are tied to flood control and pollution filtering in river catchment management. , In the past, the tree was used to treat the “falling sickness” – perhaps because of its less than upright character – and was renowned for its versatile, flame-resistant timber. Its bulk and size made it a landmark, such as the flag-bearing, ceremonial Arbor Tree in Aston on Clun., Irrespective of the uses we put it to, this sudden illumination of a wild, eccentric figure on the streamside reveals an ancient character hiding in plain sight, leaning to the light.country diary black poplar far from upright hero of the floodplain", "label": 0}, "train-303": {"text": "\nDrought, bushfires and rainstorms turn Australian rivers black – video\n, Ash, along with other detritus, from Australia's fierce bushfire season is being washed into rivers by heavy rainfall, depriving the rivers of oxygen, killing fish and turning the waters an inky, silty black, \n\nFri 14 Feb 2020 17.19 EST\n\ndrought bushfires and rainstorms turn australian rivers black video", "label": 0}, "train-304": {"text": "PM must prioritise climate or Cop26 will fail, say leading figures, IEA welcomes appointment of Alok Sharma but others worry about nature of his dual role, Boris Johnson must put the climate crisis at the top of his government’s agenda if crunch UN talks this year are to be a success, leading international figures have told the Guardian., Alok Sharma was appointed on Thursday as the business secretary and president of Cop26, the UN talks on the climate crisis to be held this November in Glasgow. Some climate experts are concerned that he won’t be able to stand up to governments reluctant to make strong commitments to cut greenhouse gases, while at the same time supporting British businesses struggling in the turmoil of Brexit., Lord Stern, former World Bank chief economist, said he had confidence in Sharma, having worked with him closely on international development issues. “Sharma has worked with developing countries, and has shown he can build up the relationships he needs,” he said. “He has the knowledge and the ability to form the relationships that are needed with developing countries that will be essential to the success of Cop26.”, The appointment of Sharma has encouraged civil servants who were concerned that Cop26 had slipped down the government’s agenda. Insiders said the appointment of Sharma – a well-regarded secretary of state for international development – would kickstart the process of international diplomacy needed to make the Cop26 climate conference a success., Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “This is an excellent choice and we at the IEA are looking forward to working together with minister Sharma and his team to support the Cop26 process in order to reach a successful outcome in Glasgow for our international climate goals. We will work together to make sure 2019 is remembered as the year of peak emissions so that the 2020s become the decade that global emissions decline quickly.”, Campaigners are concerned, however, that the dual role may get in the way of a successful outcome. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “The new business secretary has a herculean task on his hands. Not only has he got to get the UK delivering on its carbon budgets, but he’s also got to get the world behind more ambitious climate action., “At home, he needs to unblock the expansion of on- and offshore wind currently sandwiched between various government departments and backbench MPs, as well as tackling carbon emission from 30m draughty buildings. Globally, he’s got to deal with leaving the EU and signing international trade deals while also cajoling countries to get behind solving the climate emergency. This will only work if Boris Johnson steps in and puts the full weight of No 10 behind it.”, Aaron Kiely, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s hard to be optimistic about the UK’s presidency of the UN climate conference, when the man given the job is expected to do it as a side project. Leading international talks on the climate crisis is easily the most important role in government right now, yet Alok Sharma is expected to take it on at the same time as being business secretary. If the presidency is being treated as a part time gig then what next? Perhaps the conference venue will be expected to share space with a wedding fair.”, He added: “The government really needs to start taking this seriously.

Cockatoos also feast on the seeds of other crops, which has forced the company he works for to buy broad acre netting to cover seedlings., Recent bushfires have affected feeding grounds for many species across Australia., In Tasmania alone at least 32,302 hectares have been burned since the start of the 2019 fire season, which may have affected the regular feeding grounds of Tasmania’s white cockatoos, with drought also depleting resources., “I don’t know the specifics about Tasmanian feeding grounds, but in general, across Australia, all the birds are struggling to find food this year,” Watson said.flying high not getting high the poppy eating cockatoos of tasmania are no opiate addicts", "label": 0}, "train-306": {"text": "\n'A moment of complete despair': last population of Macquarie perch all but wiped out in NSW river carnage\n, Fisheries managers arrived too late to save more of the endangered species as heavy rain washes ash into NSW rivers, robbing fish of oxygen, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nFri 14 Feb 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 16 Feb 2020 17.30 EST\n\n, Luke Pearce had arrived at Mannus Creek for a three-day mission to rescue the Murray catchment’s last population of Macquarie perch., For 10 years Pearce had visited this spot on the edge of the Snowy Mountains that, just weeks earlier, was ravaged by fire. There had been rain and the creek was flowing fast., But as Pearce and his colleagues stood on the bank – nets at the ready – the water turned “to a river of black porridge”., “We got there at about midday with two teams. But we were too late,” he says., Pearce is a fisheries manager in the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. A week earlier, he had caught nine of the endangered perch and taken them to the tanks at Narrandera Fisheries Centre., But Pearce says nine was not enough to be confident they could breed enough in captivity to replenish the river. About 100 specimens would be ideal, but Pearce says the fish are in such low numbers that he was hoping for 20. Hence the rescue mission on 20 January., “It was a front of black water coming down,” Pearce says. “The water was pretty bad to start with, but it went from green to inky black., “It was a moment of complete despair and, really, a feeling of a missed opportunity. Maybe if we’d got there four or five hours earlier we may have been able to get one or two more.”, An electronic probe in the water monitoring the oxygen levels dropped to show zero within hours, Pearce says., “Watching those oxygen levels drop like that I had grave fears we could have lost all the fish in that system. It was devastating having worked there for such a long time to then potentially lose all this.”, The river was too black to see any fish, but crayfish, shrimp and mayfly larvae were crawling out., What happened at Mannus Creek is one example of what scientists have described as a “triple whammy” hitting rivers on Australia’s east coast and inland., Drought and a long-term drying has delivered a cascade of mass fish kills since late 2018, with low river flows, low oxygen and algal blooms. Authorities and politicians warned repeatedly in 2019 that ongoing drying would see more mass fish kills., Then Australia’s bushfire crisis struck across catchments. Now heavy rain has washed sludge and ash into rivers, robbing the remaining fish of oxygen., Hundreds of thousands of fish have died in multiple events – some caused by lack of water, and some caused by downpours running over burned catchments., At one time, Macquarie perch was one of the most abundant native fish in the Murray-Darling system – prized by anglers and also commercial fishers., But a NSW government assessment of the fish in 2008 wrote the building of dams and weirs had compromised spawning areas and blocked the fish’s movement. Overfishing, pollution and predation by introduced species like redfin perch had also caused numbers to plummet., Now, Pearce says there’s just one known population of the fish at Mannus Creek, near the town of Tumbarumba., On 14 January, Pearce had been to the creek to see what was left after the fires. The vegetation, the animals and the usual audio backtrack of birds and bugs he was used to seeing was now a scene of carnage., The area was littered with the burnt remains of wildlife – kangaroos, wombats, possums, birds and deer. “There’s wasn’t a sound – nothing at all,” he says. “There was nothing left – just black stalks., “All that spoke to me about the speed and ferocity of the fires – these animals just couldn’t escape. We were really concerned about the potential impact if we had any rainfall.”, The rescue attempt for the Macquarie perch is part of the biggest fish rescue project the NSW government has ever attempted., Since September, with water levels low across rivers, some 4,000 native fish have been taken from rivers and placed in tanks across the state – most in government facilities and some in private hatcheries., NSW DPI’s Dr Trevor Daly, a senior fisheries manager working on threatened species, says rescues of threatened fish have included 1,630 olive perchlet, 740 southern pygmy perch, 292 Oxleyan pygmy perch, 107 southern purple spotted gudgeon, 98 eastern freshwater cod, 79 silver perch and 34 eel-tailed catfish., Catchments targeted for rescues have included Gwydir, Border Rivers, Macquarie, Lachlan, and Upper Murray catchments in the Murray-Darling Basin, and in the Clarence and Richmond River catchments on the coast., “We’ve been battling the worst drought on record and we know we can’t save every fish, but we are doing what we can to save as many as we can,” Daly says, adding the heavy rain will likely see more fish deaths., The government says the rescue efforts are “critical” if populations of fish are going to recover when river conditions improve., Some fish are being held in tanks, while others have been relocated to rivers that do have some water., Prof Lee Baumgartner, a freshwater ecologist at Charles Sturt University, says the Murray-Darling Basin has gone through an extreme swing from wet to dry in just 18 months., “The climate change science tells us that this could be the new normal and, if it is, then we have to manage that transition much better and share the water in a more equitable way., “Fish need water in rivers. Birds can fly away if there’s drought, trees can drop leaves. But fish need water.”, How long it will take for conditions to improve at Mannus Creek is hard to say. That initial flush of “black porridge” could travel through in a matter of days, but the sediment could linger for months or even longer depending on river flows and rainfall., Last week, Pearce returned to Mannus Creek and went a little further upstream. On the banks, the black sludge was about 15cm thick, but that visit has also given him some hope., “I managed to catch another two – I released one,” he says. “I was astounded that there were still some fish surviving – I had real fears that nothing could survive. It’s given me some hope that they can still hang on., “Hopefully they’re through the worst of it.”last population macquarie perch nsw river carnage bushfire ash fish species", "label": 0}, "train-307": {"text": "\nSchool climate strikers join Valentine's Day protests across world\n, In UK, students march on first anniversary of nationwide protests by young people, \nJonathan Watts and \nJessica Murray, \n\nFri 14 Feb 2020 10.28 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2020 11.47 EST\n\n, Striking students have joined Valentine’s Day rallies across the world as the protest movement attempts to ratchet up pressure on governments and companies before crunch UN climate talks in Glasgow later this year., In London, the young demonstrators held banners proclaiming “Roses are red, violets are blue, our Earth is burning and soon we will too” and “Climate change is worse than homework” as they marched through Parliament Square on Friday to mark the first anniversary of nationwide climate strikes in the UK., Students in Durham, Glasgow, Brighton and dozens of other cities also braved often wet and cold condition to march through the streets chanting, “What do we want? Climate justice. When do we want it? Now.”, Greta Thunberg, who initiated the movement as a solitary striker in Stockholm in August 2018, said climate strikes were planned in 2,000 cities across the world on Friday, and that bigger actions were planned for the coming months., In many countries, the protests have expanded to include local environmental concerns, new strategies and stronger emphasis on global climate justice., In India on Friday, strikers turned their focus on government plans to deforest swathes of the Aravallis mountain range, which is a conservation area that provides freshwater and oxygen for Delhi and other cities. Some carried banners in English reading: “I love Aravallis”, “Our green lungs” and “Protectors are turning destroyers”., In Sydney, climate strikers demonstrated with banners that depicted the devastating bushfires and blamed the government of Scott Morrison for the “climate chaos” that has hit Australia. In the Philippines, climate strikers organised an educational storytelling campaign to raise public awareness., In Scotland, Holly Gillibrand, who was one of the first strikers in the UK when she started a vigil outside Lochaber high school in Fort William in the Highlands, said the growth of the movement had been incredible., “When I began striking over a year ago, Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future campaign were not well known at all and I was one of very few strikers in the UK, but since then, everything has changed. The movement has gone from one person to 7.5 million., “Even if we still aren’t getting the radical action we need from governments, politicians are feeling the pressure to act and we just need to keep pushing, keep shouting, keep rebelling until they do.” Holly continued her strike on Friday, with a hot chocolate to help get her through the wet weather., Among those striking for the first time on Friday was a group in Rwanda, where protesters tweeted Timages of themselves holding signs that said: “Rwanda stand for climate.”, Friday’s action was not intended as a mega-strike like those in September, when more than 6 million people took part, but it showed how the campaign has evolved., Maryam Grassly, 17, who was among the hundreds of strikers in central London, said: “The most enthusiastic and passionate people have stayed on, and more people have got involved and been inspired by it, but at the same time we’ve lost the people who didn’t really care.”, But in her mind there was no question about the relevance of the protest. “When the election happened and Boris Johnson got voted in I just kind of gave up on the world, I thought that’s it,” she said. “We’ve got the climate emergency and net zero by 2050 but nothing is happening as fast as it should be.” Similarly she was “excited but worried” about the UK hosting Cop26 later this year, saying the previous conference of the parties in Madrid did not go well., But the protesters were still hopeful about the difference they have made over the past few months., Maude Brown, 17, said: “I’ve been very concerned about the issue for almost a decade, I was taught about it in year 4, and no one really cared then so I’m happy that everyone is concerned about it now. I think as more politicians from our generation come in we can make a lot of change in the future.”, Most of the strikers were teenagers, but there were some younger children too. Claire Bullivant, from Essex, has been bringing her children Imogen, 12, Max, 9 and Theodore, 5, to the strikes for a few months., “I just think it’s so important to get them involved and to support them because they’re so aware of what’s happening in the world, and they see it in the news, and we don’t want to sit back and do nothing,” Bullivant said., While her daughter’s school has been supportive of her decision to take time off for the strikes, her sons’ school has been less so, but Bullivant said the time off was “totally justified”., “It’s educational, it’s empowering to be part of a community and show that they’re trying to make a difference to the world, I just don’t think you can underestimate experiences like this,” she said., Asked why she was so keen to get involved, Imogen said: “If we don’t save the Earth there’s not going to be anywhere else for us to live.”, A year ago, the size of the protests in the UK took police by surprise, as thousands defied their teachers to skip school and join the still nascent movement. The students are now backed by longer established environmental organisations, including Global Justice Now, Greenpeace and the Green party. Among those at Friday’s march in London was a trade union climate bloc., Friends of the Earth are backing the school climate strikers, who it credits for shifting public opinion. There is still a long way to go, but with technology developments and strong policies, the group said there was cause for hope. “Huge change is possible. In 2019, the UK went coal-free for 19 days. That’s the longest break since the 1880s, and something that would have been unthinkable a few decades ago,” it said.school climate strikers join valentines day protests across world", "label": 0}, "train-308": {"text": "\nEU spending tens of millions of euros a year to promote meat eating\n, Campaigns to promote consumption of pork and veal labelled ‘indefensible’ in light of health and climate concerns, \nDaniel Boffey in Brussels, \n\nFri 14 Feb 2020 07.12 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2020 12.25 EST\n\n, The EU has been accused of an “indefensible” approach to human health and the climate crisis in spending tens of millions of euros each year on campaigns to reverse the decline in meat eating and trying to rebut so-called “fake news” on the mistreatment of animals bred for food., Campaigns range from those designed to counter official warnings about the risk of cancer from eating red meat, to improving the public image of veal products said to be crucial in “deriving value from young male calves” superfluous to the dairy industry., The EU provides an annual €200m (£166m) subsidy for the “promotion of agricultural products” each year. About €60m has been spent in the last three years on 21 meat marketing campaigns, including in the UK, according to research by the Dutch animal welfare organisation Wakker Dier., The stated ambition of many of the projects has been to halt a decline in meat consumption amid a growing trend to vegetarianism among Europe’s young people., The livestock sector is responsible for about 14.5% of total human-derived greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists have provided evidence of a link between cancer and diets involving pork, beef and lamb products., The description on the European commission website of one recent campaign entitled Pork Lovers Europe, which secured €1.4m for marketing, including a “road-show” with a pink bus painted to look like a pig, noted “that the consumption of pork meat in Europe has decreased in recent years”., It continued: “Therefore, it is very important to promote pork meat to restore the confidence of the consumer, which was shaken by news such as the last IARC International Agency for Research on Cancer report.”, Scientists at the IARC, a UN agency, reported in 2015 that the consumption of bacon, red meat and glyphosate weedkiller increased the risk of developing cancer. The Pork Lovers Europe adverts targeted consumers in the UK, Spain, Germany, France and Portugal., A campaign by the Association of Poultry Processors and Poultry Trade which will be run in six member states at a cost to EU taxpayers of €4.4m aims over the next two years to “contradict myths and fake news” about the rearing and slaughter of chickens for meat., “EU poultry consumption in the European Union is still increasing but at a slower pace, as more and more consumers are mistrustful regarding the poultry meat production,” the European commission’s website says. The campaign, targeting a 1.22% growth in chicken consumption in 2020 and 2021, is aimed at “young children, professionals, media and opinion leaders”., A second pork campaign received a €2.5m subsidy for an initiative aimed at Danes and Swedes. “Pork is no longer a natural part of the diet of young Scandinavians,” the commission website says. “They tend to eat less meat in general and to avoid pork in particular. The aim is to increase consumer demand and thus halt any otherwise expected fall.”, A campaign in favour of the Dutch veal sector to promote the meat of calves in the Belgian, Italian and French markets received a €6m subsidy., “The veal market has been declining since the 2000s,” says a description of the project on the commission website. “There are various reasons for this: the economic crisis, changes in consumption behaviour and above all a lack of top-of-mind awareness. France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy are minded to fight this fall in consumption by boosting the image consumers have of European veal.”, Sjoerd van de Wouw, a researcher at Wakker Dier foundation, said the funding policy was outdated indefensible. “We understand that you need to consider the interests of producers but not by completing ignoring the interests of consumers and the climate,” he said., In response, a European commission spokesman said: “The selection of projects is based on a strict and defined procedure involving external evaluators. The producers’ organisations send proposals regarding their campaign ideas and also participate in the funding of the campaigns., “In an effort to constantly evaluate and adjust its existing policy, the commission will soon launch a public consultation on the EU promotion policy for agricultural products.”eu spending tens of millions of euros a year to promote meat eating", "label": 0}, "train-309": {"text": "School strikes give me hope, says head of Friends of the Earth, Outgoing charity chief Craig Bennett says next generation ‘could not be more exciting’, The school strikes movement will ensure an exciting and dynamic future for environmental activism for decades to come, the outgoing head of Friends of the Earth has said, as students across the globe leave classrooms on Friday to demand political action on the climate crisis., Speaking on the first anniversary of the movement in the UK, Craig Bennett said it was grassroots activism, not centralised politics, that was leading to change., “What we are seeing is a new kind of informed and exciting activism,” said Bennett. “What excites me most is seeing the awakening of communities. To see the school strikes – to see the next generation of activists coming through – could not be more exciting for the movement long term., “To have a whole generation coming through going on these demonstrations, where is that going to take us? What is going to happen in 10 years’ time when they start being in employment? Are they suddenly going to turn off the activism? I don’t think so, and that is what is really hopeful for the environmental movement.”, Bennett is leaving the environmental charity after 18 years, the last five as head of the organisation. In that time, the group has shifted its focus from the past tactics of lobbying Westminster politicians to the creation and development of a grassroots base of activists., In the last 18 months 150 new community action groups have been created by the movement, while supporters of the environmental charity have more than doubled from about 160,000 to more than 400,000., The move to tap into and amplify community frustrations at the failure to do enough to tackle climate breakdown has coincided with the growth of the school strikes movement and the appearance of Extinction Rebellion., “We have got to use the politics on the ground rather than rely on centralised institutions and politicians to do it for us,” he said., Bennett – who will take over as head of the Wildlife Trust in April – believes the explosion of activism has been caused partly by the deep frustration of ordinary people that we are not making fast enough progress to tackle climate change, combined with growing evidence from scientists that the world has an ever decreasing amount of time to make change., “There is something that is unique about these issues,” said Bennett. “The longer we take to achieve the change, the worse the prize of the outcome. It is quite different to, say, campaigning for the abolition of slavery … the prize you get is still the same, even if it takes 100 years to get there., “But campaigning for eight or nine billion people to live fairly within environmental limits, the longer you take to do it, the lower the quality of the prize you get.”, In his tenure at Friends of the Earth, Bennett has focused on community-based action against fracking in the UK, activism that was rewarded last year when the government announced a moratorium on fracking., He believes it is community activism that has pushed the government to act against fracking, and prompted the attention Boris Johnson’s government is giving to environmental concerns. Last week Johnson brought forward the deadline for ending the sale of diesel, petrol and hybrid vehicles from 2040 to 2035., “It is primarily because of people on the streets that this is happening,” said Bennett. He pointed to polling by the thinktank Bright Blue showing that climate change and the environment were crucial to gain the support of the centre ground in British politics. “People care about the environment more than ever before,” said Bennett., Faced with what he believes are small moves by the government, Bennett says the environmental movement, including the school strikers, must continue to demonstrate and push for more rapid change. The government’s target of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 was important, but lacked any detail, he said. The prospect of the UK hosting the UN climate summit in September without “the first clue” of how to reach net zero as a nation was “unbelievably embarrassing”, said Bennett., “There is no plan to get to there,” he said. “The committee on climate change has produced a report on how to get there, but that is not government policy., “Where is the plan to cut UK carbon emissions by somewhere between 50% and 80% by 2030? That is what we need, at the very least. We need to be cutting emissions by about 15% each year from today. What matters is less the talk about net zero, but how fast we can cut emissions within the lifetime of this current parliament., “Given Boris Johnson has a stonking majority, he has no excuse and this government should do exactly what is required.”school strikes hope friends of the earth craig bennett", "label": 0}, "train-310": {"text": "\nCountry diary: feeding waders are not the only magical sight on this shore\n, Howick Haven, Northumberland: Fresh water bubbles out of the rock, churning grainy sand in a small erupting cauldron, \nSusie White, \n\nFri 14 Feb 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, As we walk northwards from the fishing village of Boulmer, the beach is heaped with waist-deep piles of seaweed. There must have been a recent storm to have thrown up so much debris. A nimble robin picks off tiny insects from this new feast. Sanderlings skitter along on speedy legs, feeding as they go. The waves have deposited large grey boulders, as yet smooth and uncolonised by limpets., Though there’s a cold wind snagging at our clothes, the far-off edge of today’s low tide is lacy and calm. Birds feed across the wide area of exposed rocks and pools: a hunched heron waiting sharp-eyed; cormorants the colour of Whitby jet; vibrant oystercatchers, strikingly black and white. Redshanks strut on bright legs, delving with their black-tipped red beaks. Turnstones work fast, head-butting bladderwrack to snap up crustaceans and molluscs. In a shallow inlet, there are drifts of rusty-headed wigeon. Black-tailed godwits probe wet muddy sand with long bills, their bodies slender and elegant on thin legs. There is motion everywhere we look., The distant sandy-coloured walls of Dunstanburgh Castle are lit by pale sunlight, a ragged wedge sticking out into the North Sea. We meet no other walkers all the way to Howick Haven. The low cliffs around this sheltered bay are topped in a scrub of gorse and bramble. A black redstart perches briefly on a dock seedhead before dropping into long grass, searching for insects or spiders perhaps. In the calm water of the Haven there’s a small raft of goldeneye., Below the north-facing cliff, fresh water bubbles out of level rock to flow away down a narrow channel to the sea. Grainy sand is being churned around in this small erupting cauldron. With its feeling of magic, I’d like to think it was a natural spring. It was, in fact, a geological experiment, an artesian borehole drilled in the 1960s by a team from Newcastle University to prove the succession of strata.

He died at his home on Thursday, the Press Trust of India reported., Pachauri won civilian awards from India’s government in 2001 and 2008., TERI’s chairman, Nitin Desai, hailed Pachauri’s contribution to global sustainable development. “His leadership of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change laid the ground for climate change conversations today,” Desai said., The allegations against Pachauri included claims that he sent suggestive text messages, e-mails and WhatsApp messages harassing a 29-year-old female employee in his organisation., Pachauri had denied the charges and his attorneys claimed his messages were hacked in an attempt to malign him. New Delhi police filed a complaint in court but the trial could not be completed., Professor Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, the IPCC vice-chairman from 2002 to 2015, said coming from a developing country Pachauri should be credited for drawing the attention, long before others, to the importance of finding synergies between climate policies and sustainable developing agenda. “Unfortunately he was sometimes overconfident as when he refused to quickly acknowledge and correct the insignificant error that had been present in an IPCC report.

But isn’t it too late to stop the climate crisis?We are definitely running late. We have delayed appallingly for decades. But science tells us we are still in the nick of time., You say this decade is the most consequential in human history…This is the decade in which, contrary to everything humanity has experienced before, we have everything in our power. We have the capital, the technology, the policies. And we have the scientific knowledge to understand that we have to half our emissions by 2030., So we are facing the most consequential fork in the road. If we continue as now, we are going to be irreparably going down a course of constant destruction, with much human pain and biodiversity loss. Or we can choose to go in the other direction, a path of reconstruction and regeneration, and at least diminish the negative impacts of climate change to something that is manageable., But we can only choose it this decade. Our parents did not have this choice, because they didn’t have the capital, technologies and understanding. And for our children, it will be too late. So this is the decade and we are the generation., Only 11 pages or so of the book describe the terrible consequences of unchecked climate change, while the rest talks about the possibility of a much better world. Why?It’s important for everyone to face the negative consequences that we’re sleepwalking ourselves toward, which is why those 11 pages are there. But equally as important is to spark the imagination and the creativity that comes with understanding that we do have this incredible agency to create something completely different., We wanted to offer both universes to those who, understandably, are paralysed by despair and grief at the loss that is already under way, as well as those who are paralysed by their comfort and lack of understanding of the moment that we’re in., A lot of the book is about the need for a shift in people’s consciousness. Isn’t this rather grandiose or, on the other hand, too vague to make a difference in the real world?Whatever we hold as being possible, and whatever values and principles we live by, determine the actions that we take. Whatever we hold to be near and dear to us is what we’re willing to work toward. And so to shift from doom and gloom to a positive, optimistic, constructive attitude is very important because it is what gets us up in the morning and says “yes, we can do this, we’re going to work together on that”, rather than pulling the blanket over our head and saying “it’s all too difficult”. So that change in attitude inside ourselves is critical., We also have to understand that we can no longer live in a world based on limitless extraction and waste. Rather, we have to change our consciousness to one of regeneration., How can people’s consciousness change in that way?The first thing we have to understand is the consequence of not changing our attitudes. There are very serious existential consequences. Then hopefully we can make a serious, mature decision whether we want to choose something different., One of the 10 actions recommended in the book is to be a citizen and not a consumer. Can you explain that and why it is important?The very concept of being a consumer already points us in the direction of consuming irresponsibly. We have to be able at some point, particularly in developed countries, to get to the point where we say “enough is enough”. Before you make a purchase, or an investment, or any kind of decision that impacts on the planet and on other people, the question should be: “Do I really need this and is this actually conducive to furthering the quality of life on this planet?”, Another of the actions you chose is building gender equality. Why?Educating young women and empowering women to come to decision-making tables is the strongest thing that we can do for the climate. When there are more women in boardrooms and in high-level positions in institutions, you get decisions that are wiser and longer term., Of course there are many men that also do this. But there is a tendency for women to be more collaborative, which is the basis of what we need to do, and they tend to think much more long term. Women have the first duty of care of our newborn children and hence, biologically, we’re geared towards that stewardship. But it is just plain stupid, frankly, not to use 50% of human potential. We are in such an emergency that we need to deploy 100% of our potential., Tackling the climate emergency requires global cooperation and action by governments and businesses. But what can individuals do?We tend to forget that it is humans who have caused climate change, and we tend to export responsibility to large corporations or governments. The fact is, we all contributed to it., If we all reduce our emissions, collectively we give a signal to the market. Obviously, corporations have their own responsibilities but it’s helpful to have a strong demand from the public. Once you get governments, corporations and the public moving in the same direction towards low carbon, it can grow exponentially such as with renewable energy and electric cars., People reducing their emissions – by flying less, eating less meat and using clean energy, for example – is important., But is demanding that politicians tackle the climate emergency and voting accordingly perhaps the most important thing individuals can do?I would say both. If we had 50 years to fiddle with this, then you could choose one or the other. But we are in such an emergency that we can no longer do things sequentially or exclusively. We have to be an “and/also” world., • The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac is published by Manilla Press (£12.99).

We have been successful at halving emissions every decade since 2020. We are heading for a world that will be no more than 1.5C warmer by 2100, In most places in the world, the air is moist and fresh, even in cities. It feels a lot like walking through a forest and very likely this is exactly what you are doing. The air is cleaner than it has been since before the Industrial Revolution. We have trees to thank for that. They are everywhere., It wasn’t the single solution we required, but the proliferation of trees bought us the time we needed to vanquish carbon emissions. When we started, it was purely practical, a tactic to combat climate crisis by relocating the carbon: the trees took carbon dioxide out of the air, released oxygen and put the carbon back where it belongs, in the soil. This, of course, helped to diminish climate crisis, but the benefits were even greater. On every sensory level, the ambient feeling of living on what has again become a green planet has been transformative, especially in cities., Reimagining and restructuring cities was crucial to solving the climate challenge puzzle. But further steps had to be taken, which meant that global rewilding efforts had to reach well beyond the cities. The forest cover worldwide is now 50% and agriculture has evolved to become more tree-based. The result is that many countries are unrecognisable, in a good way. No one seems to miss wide-open plains or monocultures. Now we have shady groves of nut and orchards, timber land interspersed with grazing, parkland areas that spread for miles, new havens for our regenerated population of pollinators., Drones organised along aerial corridors are now delivering packages, further reducing the need for vehicles, A major part of the shift to net-zero emissions was a focus on electricity; achieving the goal required not only an overhaul of existing infrastructure but also a structural shift. In some ways, breaking up grids and decentralising power proved easy. We no longer burn fossil fuels. Most of our energy now comes from renewable sources such as wind, solar, geothermal and hydro. All homes and buildings produce their own electricity – every available surface is covered with solar paint that contains millions of nanoparticles, which harvest energy from the sunlight, and every windy spot has a wind turbine. If you live on a particularly sunny or windy hill, your house might harvest more energy than it can use, in which case the energy will simply flow back to the smart grid. Because there is no combustion cost, energy is basically free. It is also more abundant and more efficiently used than ever., Homes and buildings all over the world are becoming self-sustaining far beyond their electrical needs. For example, all buildings now collect rainwater and manage their own water use. Renewable sources of electricity make possible localised desalination, which means clean drinking water can now be produced on demand anywhere in the world. We also use it to irrigate hydroponic gardens, flush toilets and shower., Petrol and diesel cars are anachronisms. Most countries banned their manufacture in 2030, but it took another 15 years to get internal combustion engines off the road completely., What’s strange is that it took us so long to realise that the electric motor is simply a better way of powering vehicles. It gives you more torque, more speed when you need it, and the ability to recapture energy when you brake and it requires dramatically less maintenance., We also share cars without thinking twice. In fact, regulating and ensuring the safety of driverless ride sharing were the biggest transportation hurdles for cities to overcome. The goal has been to eliminate private ownership of vehicles by 2050 in major metropolitan areas. We’re not quite there yet, but we’re making progress., We have also reduced land transport needs. Drones organised along aerial corridors are now delivering packages, further reducing the need for vehicles. Thus we are currently narrowing roads, eliminating parking spaces and investing in urban planning projects that make it easier to walk and bike in the city., While we may have successfully reduced carbon emissions, we’re still dealing with the aftereffects of record levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The long-living greenhouse gases have nowhere to go other than the already-loaded atmosphere, so they are still causing increasingly extreme weather, though it’s less extreme than it would have been had we continued to burn fossil fuels., Glaciers and Arctic ice are still melting and the sea is still rising. Severe droughts and desertification are occurring in the western United States, the Mediterranean and parts of China. Ongoing extreme weather and resource degradation continue to multiply existing disparities in income, public health, food security and water availability. But now governments have recognised climate crisis factors for the threat multipliers that they are. That awareness allows us to predict downstream problems and head them off before they become humanitarian crises., Everyone understands that we are all in this together. A disaster that occurs in one country is likely to occur in another in only a matter of years. It took us a while to realise that if we worked out how to save the Pacific islands from rising sea levels this year, then we might find a way to save Rotterdam in another five years., The zeitgeist has shifted profoundly. How we feel about the world has changed, deeply. And, unexpectedly, so has how we feel about one another., When the alarm bells rang in 2020, thanks in large part to the youth movement, we realised that we suffered from too much consumption, competition, and greedy self-interest. Our commitment to these values and our drive for profit and status had led us to steamroll our environment. As a species, we were out of control and the result was the near-collapse of our world., We emerged from the climate crisis as more mature members of the community of life, capable of not only restoring ecosystems but also of unfolding our dormant potentials of human strength and discernment. Humanity was only ever as doomed as it believed itself to be. Vanquishing that belief was our true legacy., • This is an edited extract from The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, published by Manilla Press (£12.99).

Beyond the emissions reductions registered in 2015, no further efforts were made to control emissions. We are heading for a world that will be more than 3C warmer by 2100, The first thing that hits you is the air. In many places around the world, the air is hot, heavy and, depending on the day, clogged with particulate pollution. Your eyes often water. Your cough never seems to disappear. You think about some countries in Asia, where, out of consideration, sick people used to wear white masks to protect others from airborne infection. Now you often wear a mask to protect yourself from air pollution. You can no longer simply walk out your front door and breathe fresh air: there might not be any. Instead, before opening doors or windows in the morning, you check your phone to see what the air quality will be., Melting permafrost releases ancient microbes today’s humans have never been exposed to and have no resistance to, Fewer people work outdoors and even indoors the air can taste slightly acidic, sometimes making you feel nauseated. The last coal furnaces closed 10 years ago, but that hasn’t made much difference in air quality around the world because you are still breathing dangerous exhaust fumes from millions of cars and buses everywhere. Our world is getting hotter. Over the next two decades, projections tell us that temperatures in some areas of the globe will rise even higher, an irreversible development now utterly beyond our control. Oceans, forests, plants, trees and soil had for many years absorbed half the carbon dioxide we spewed out. Now there are few forests left, most of them either logged or consumed by wildfire, and the permafrost is belching greenhouse gases into an already overburdened atmosphere. The increasing heat of the Earth is suffocating us and in five to 10 years, vast swaths of the planet will be increasingly inhospitable to humans. We don’t know how hospitable the arid regions of Australia, South Africa and the western United States will be by 2100. No one knows what the future holds for their children and grandchildren: tipping point after tipping point is being reached, casting doubt on the form of future civilisation. Some say that humans will be cast to the winds again, gathering in small tribes, hunkered down and living on whatever patch of land might sustain them., More moisture in the air and higher sea surface temperatures have caused a surge in extreme hurricanes and tropical storms. Recently, coastal cities in Bangladesh, Mexico, the United States and elsewhere have suffered brutal infrastructure destruction and extreme flooding, killing many thousands and displacing millions. This happens with increasing frequency now. Every day, because of rising water levels, some part of the world must evacuate to higher ground. Every day, the news shows images of mothers with babies strapped to their backs, wading through floodwaters and homes ripped apart by vicious currents that resemble mountain rivers. News stories tell of people living in houses with water up to their ankles because they have nowhere else to go, their children coughing and wheezing because of the mould growing in their beds, insurance companies declaring bankruptcy, leaving survivors without resources to rebuild their lives. Contaminated water supplies, sea salt intrusions and agricultural runoff are the order of the day. Because multiple disasters are often happening simultaneously, it can take weeks or even months for basic food and water relief to reach areas pummelled by extreme floods. Diseases such as malaria, dengue, cholera, respiratory illnesses and malnutrition are rampant., You try not to think about the 2 billion people who live in the hottest parts of the world, where, for upwards of 45 days per year, temperatures skyrocket to 60C (140F), a point at which the human body cannot be outside for longer than about six hours because it loses the ability to cool itself down. Places such as central India are becoming increasingly challenging to inhabit. Mass migrations to less hot rural areas are beset by a host of refugee problems, civil unrest and bloodshed over diminished water availability., Food production swings wildly from month to month, season to season, depending on where you live. More people are starving than ever before. Climate zones have shifted, so some new areas have become available for agriculture (Alaska, the Arctic), while others have dried up (Mexico, California). Still others are unstable because of the extreme heat, never mind flooding, wildfire and tornadoes. This makes the food supply in general highly unpredictable. Global trade has slowed as countries seek to hold on to their own resources., Countries with enough food are resolute about holding on to it. As a result, food riots, coups and civil wars are throwing the world’s most vulnerable from the frying pan into the fire. As developed countries seek to seal their borders from mass migration, they too feel the consequences. Most countries’ armies are now just highly militarised border patrols. Some countries are letting people in, but only under conditions approaching indentured servitude. , Those living within stable countries may be physically safe, yes, but the psychological toll is mounting. With each new tipping point passed, they feel hope slipping away. There is no chance of stopping the runaway warming of our planet and no doubt we are slowly but surely heading towards some kind of collapse. And not just because it’s too hot. Melting permafrost is also releasing ancient microbes that today’s humans have never been exposed to and, as a result, have no resistance to. Diseases spread by mosquitoes and ticks are rampant as these species flourish in the changed climate, spreading to previously safe parts of the planet, increasingly overwhelming us. Worse still, the public health crisis of antibiotic resistance has only intensified as the population has grown denser in inhabitable areas and temperatures continue to rise., The demise of the human species is being discussed more and more. For many, the only uncertainty is how long we’ll last, how many more generations will see the light of day. Suicides are the most obvious manifestation of the prevailing despair, but there are other indications: a sense of bottomless loss, unbearable guilt and fierce resentment at previous generations who didn’t do what was necessary to ward off this unstoppable calamity., • This is an edited extract from The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, published by Manilla Press (£12.99).

But just 10 years ago, the same view would have been even more disappointing: mountains of rubbish heaped up on one of Europe’s largest landfill sites., For 50 years, the site absorbed waste belched out by Londoners. Now the only reminder of its past life is the odd piece of discarded metal., The park might look unloved, but the reserve is meticulously managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust (EWT) and provides a valuable home for some of the UK’s rarest inhabitants, including cuckoos, adders, water voles and the extremely rare shrill carder bee., “This is the best view in Essex,” says Emily McParland, communications manager at EWT, who urges visitors to the site on the Thames estuary to “celebrate unglamorous landscapes”., “Many people are unaware of just how valuable scrub is as a habitat. It is one of the most underrated habitats and some of our most iconic British species need scrubland to thrive, so that is one thing we try to educate our visitors about,” she says., In the mid-1990s there were about 1,500 active landfill sites in the UK. Now there are fewer than 250, largely because taxes were introduced that made sending rubbish to landfill more expensive than incineration., Now scrubby landfills across the country are becoming significant refuges for rare species. There are 20,000 old landfill sites in England and 1,315 of them have at least one environmental designation on them, according to analysis of Environment Agency and Natural England data by Dr James Brand from Queen Mary University of London. A significant proportion – 11% – of sites of special scientific interest in England are built at least in part on old landfill., “This isn’t surprising. It is likely in many cases that the land isn’t suitable for other uses due to the waste buried beneath it,” says Brand., The landfill that forms Thurrock’s scruffy 49-hectare (120-acre) hillock sits on top of a 1920s quarry, which provided building materials for the burgeoning capital. The mine closed in the 1950s and the city’s unwanted waste was brought back and dumped in the newly vacant space. At one point Mucking Marsh landfill, as the site was called then, took 660,000 tonnes of rubbish every year., Now it provides an important pit stop for short-eared owls from Iceland, nightingales from Senegal and song thrushes from Russia looking to refuel on bugs and berries before continuing their travels., All this life is reliant on a layer of clay crust just 1.4 metres (4.6ft) thick, which sits on 30 metres of gurgling waste, weighing around 20m tonnes. The only building on site – the visitor centre – is held upright by hydraulic jacks., Like most landfill sites, this crust is too thin to support trees because their roots would penetrate the black plastic the waste is wrapped in, potentially causing methane and toxic liquids to be released into the environment. This is why wildlife reserves on landfill sites are often left as scrub or grassland., Thurrock’s transformation from rubbish dump to wildlife reserve came about from a £2.8m agreement between Enovert Community Trust – previously Cory Environmental Trust – and the London Gateway port operator, DP World, to improve wildlife sites along the estuary. The landfill stopped accepting waste in 2010 and as each section was sealed up it was released to EWT to look after. Once the clay top is complete, the EWT reserve will be 340 hectares – double the size of Regent’s Park., Mucking Marsh landfill belches out enough methane gas to power around 10,500 homes. This potent greenhouse gas is released via a pipeline and then combusted to form CO2 and particulate matter before being released into the atmosphere. Enovert will manage the decaying matter until it stops producing gas, which is expected to happen in 2040. The decay of organic waste on landfills accounts for one third of UK’s methane emissions, so making sure landfills are properly sealed is key to minimising environmental damage., Other grassy mounds along the estuary – such as those at Beckton and Rainham – have been formed in recent years. They might look like the remains of some iron age fort, but they too are stuffed full of modern man’s excesses and neatly capped off with a clay “pie crust” as if nothing had happened., When David Attenborough opened Thurrock Thameside nature reserve in 2013, he said its transformation marked a “new chapter” in the Thames estuary. In the years following his visit, the number of plant species has increased from 48 to 91, according to EWT, with bee orchid, yellow rattle and bird’s foot trefoil all new additions to the site., Whitethroat, stonechat, song thrush and linnet already use the brambles for nest-building and foraging, and in the coming years EWT plans to put down a seed mix of grain and millet to attract more farmland birds which have suffered substantial declines, including skylarks, corn buntings and turtle doves, which are currently heading towards extinction in the UK., Reptiles such as the adder are also flourishing, overwintering in the undisturbed brambles and emerging in spring to warm themselves up on the grassy edges., Thurrock Thameside is far from a manicured environment, but this is the sort of land nature needs, says Prof Karl Williams, director of theCentre for Waste Management at the University of Central Lancashire. “Land that is good for wildlife normally looks unkempt in our eyes,” he says., “You’d be surprised how close landfill sites are to where you live. A lot of the time they are filling a hole in the ground and are restoring land to what it was before quarrying and mining. They cannot be developed on, so it allows nature to reclaim them and for species to come back.”, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featureswhat lies beneath the nature park covering up a dirty secret aoe", "label": 0}, "train-317": {"text": "\nExtinction Rebellion protest at Gatwick and London fashion week\n, Activists aim to raise awareness of sustainable design and the need to reduce emissions from flights, \nNadeem Badshah, \n\nSat 15 Feb 2020 07.19 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 15 Feb 2020 09.54 EST\n\n, Activists from Extinction Rebellion (XR) blocked traffic outside a London fashion week venue on Saturday and also staged a protest at Gatwick airport., Dozens of demonstrators prevented traffic from passing through a busy intersection leading to the Strand in Westminster, where the fashion trade show was being held., Protesters carried placards reading: “No more false fashion” and “No fashion on a dead planet,” while others wore dresses made from chains., Last week, XR members delivered a letter to the British Fashion Council, calling for it to cancel the next London fashion week, due to be held in September., Sara Arnold, who helped coordinate the protest, said: “London is home to the cutting edge of sustainable and ethical design and yet London fashion week lags behind., “And despite having an active political engagement programme, you have done almost nothing to lobby for environmental policies, without which a transition with the urgency we need is simply impossible., “We have all failed, but now radical leadership is required.

Finally, the Helvellyn massif comes into view; a huge throne of snow and rock shining pristinely in the sun like an English Alp., After a few days of ferocious storms, the skies have cleared in time for the weekend and the fells have re-emerged with a snowy facelift. The fleeting window of opportunity during an unpredictable winter pulls people from far and wide; we hear Brummie, scouse and geordie on the way up., We make a beeline for the famous glacial handiwork that is Striding Edge. In “full” winter conditions, safely negotiating this narrow, stegosaurus-back ridge – a metre across at its tightest – requires a few mountaineering tools. We pull out ice axes, attach crampons, and start out across the arête. It is fun, exhilarating work; a combination of careful teetering and hands-on scrambling, with snow-plastered slopes falling away either side., But as it turns out, snow coverage on the ridge itself is patchy. Clambering over a slab, I am struck by the volume of crampon scratches scarring the rock. Many climbs are marked by this involuntary graffiti, so to see them here is unsurprising, but the cumulative impact seems particularly striking., Conditions like these, where snow and ice mingle with bare rock, make such scratches and defacements more likely. I wonder how many of the ones I see today are new. Later that weekend, one of the felltop assessors (mountaineers who assess conditions on Helvellyn daily) tweets concern at the number of fresh scrape marks. It’s the sort of ethical question that can cause Tolstoy-sized threads on climbing forums. In marginal conditions, can activities requiring sharp bits of metal be justified? Where to draw the line between safety and conservation?, As temperatures warm and prime winter weather gets rarer, this may become more of a sticking point. But beyond that, in some winterless future, I wonder if these marks will be seen like ice age rock art or cave paintings: a physical insight into an older, colder age.country diary lake district fell climbers leave their mark on an english alp", "label": 0}, "train-319": {"text": "\nClimate summit calls for urgent action after Australia's fire-hit summer\n, Forceful declaration calls for governments to set short-term zero emissions target to avoid catastrophic warming, \nBen Doherty, \n\nFri 14 Feb 2020 19.43 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2020 21.46 EST\n\n, The megafires of Australia’s summer “are a harbinger of life and death on a hotter Earth”, a climate summit has said in a forceful declaration for urgent and dramatic climate action., The Climate Emergency Summit, held in Melbourne this week and of which Guardian Australia was a partner, released a declaration saying the warming world was a clear threat to Australian society and civilisation., “The climate is already dangerous – in Australia and the Antarctic, in Asia and the Pacific – right around the world. The Earth is unacceptably too hot now,” the declaration said., “If the climate warms 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the Great Barrier Reef will likely be lost, sea levels could rise metres and massive global carbon stores such as the Amazon and Greenland, will hit tipping points, releasing millions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.”, Signatories to the declaration included Ian Dunlop, Carmen Lawrence, John Hewson, Tim Costello and Kerryn Phelps. It warned that even the Paris agreement emissions reduction targets would put the world on a path to 3.5C warming by 2100, and 4C to 5C warming “when long-term climate-system feedbacks were factored in”., The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. , The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk., Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. , Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past., The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970., Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists., NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work., “National security analysts warn that 3C may result in “outright social chaos”, and 4C is considered incompatible with the maintenance of human civilisation., “Climate change must be accepted as an overriding threat to national and human security, with the response being the highest priority at national and global levels.”, The declaration called on governments to commit to rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero, to drawing down carbon concentrations already in the atmosphere, and to integrating adaptation and resilience measures into restructured national and global economies., The executive director of Micah Australia, Tim Costello, told the Guardian the declaration was a rallying cry to emphasise the critical nature of the climate challenge., “This summit was people from military, agriculture, from politics, from economics: we’re all frustrated, we want to see action and a breakthrough, we’re all working hard in our areas, but none of us actually know what will be the tipping point, when it will finally be widely realised that this is an emergency and we have to decarbonise,” Costello said., “Like people understood the emergency of war, there will be a suspension of politics and human rights if we don’t deal with climate.”, He said party politics had failed Australia, and shown itself incapable of dealing with the climate emergency., And, he argued, climate change as an existential threat had long been a reality for communities across Australia’s region., “I have seen the poorest communities already losing lives and livelihoods for years from climate change. Now it is our existential challenge after these bushfires, whereas at the Pacific Islands Forum our prime minister was told ‘it is only economic for you, it is existential survival for us’.”, The declaration said Australia’s political leaders were especially culpable, guilty of short-term political expediency, which had left Australians acutely exposed to the impacts of climate change., “The first duty of a government is to protect the people, their well-being and livelihoods. Instead, Australian governments have left the community largely unprepared for the disasters now unfolding, and for the extensive changes required to maintain a cohesive society as climate change impacts escalate.”, The declaration argued it was in Australia’s self-interest to demand greater global action on climate change, and a continued reliance on fossil fuel resources was unsustainable, both economically and environmentally., Australia was the world’s fourth largest carbon polluter, exports included, and one of the countries most exposed to climate change, the declaration said., “It makes no sense to build our economy on fossil fuel resources, practices and technologies which are unsustainable, particularly when Australia has some of the best clean energy resources and opportunities in the world.”climate summit calls for urgent action after australias fire hit summer", "label": 0}, "train-320": {"text": "Inside Australia's climate emergency: the taps run dry, Dozens of Australian towns have run out of drinking water. This is what happens when the taps run dry, When Fleur Magick Dennis moved her family to Euchareena in July 2017, the dam that supplies the tiny village with water was full, the three local creeks were flowing and her four boys didn’t have to share bathwater., “Everything was green,” the Wiradjuri woman remembers., Fleur, 40, and her husband, Laurance, 47 — known as Locky — picked their home in central New South Wales to keep their children away from the ghettoised estates of nearby towns., But within 12 months, drought had bitten so hard that the dam the kids used to cool off was almost empty. The town water supply — never drinkable, but usable for laundry, toilets and watering plants — was turned off., For months there was no water coming from the taps. The rainwater tank, once used just for drinking water but now the only supply, was running low., The family lives in a run-down rented property. Even if it does rain, “we end up with more water in the living room than we do in the tank”, Locky says., The only option was to pay $450 for a water truck to drop 15,000 litres into the rainwater tank each month., Parts of New South Wales received big downpours in early February — but it was not enough to break the drought. About 70 towns in the state are still facing the prospect of serious water security problems within 12 months, including running out entirely, unless there is significant rainfall. Water carting, bores, pipelines and desalination plants are planned for multiple towns. , As many as 15 towns have already had to cart in water., Euchareena sits in the Macquarie Valley. Just 30 minutes’ drive away is the rest of the region’s main water supply at Burrendong Dam, a vast inland store that can hold as much as three Sydney Harbours’ worth of water, serving about 70,000 people., In early February, the dam was at 1.5% capacity. The average annual inflow into Lake Burrendong is 1,450bn litres. In the 24 months up to October 2019, only 87bn litres reached the dam., Water storage has decreased in many inland dams in NSW, to the point where several major dams are effectively empty, This map shows the % storage level for dams in NSW as at 17 January, excluding those in coastal areas, Major inland dams, Storage level, Coffs, Harbour, 0%, 10%, 50%, 100%, Population centre, Menindee, Dubbo, Sydney, Canberra, Storage level trend, Average 17%, 100%, 50%, 0%, 1990, 2000, 2010, Feb 2020, Evaporation and water lost from vegetation is projected to increase with climate change, This map shows evapotranspiration (water lost from the environment and plants) for the period 1986-2005 compared with that projected for 2080-99.

They asked the rain spirit Wahwee to bring rain for the people and the land., The Macquarie Valley sits in the north of the Murray-Darling basin, where the drought has been fierce. Rainfall totals have been the lowest on record here., “This is a very extreme drought,” says Dr Ben Henley, a climate scientist researching water resources at Monash University. “But actually, so far it’s quite short.”, He says climate models are so far inconclusive about whether the Macquarie Valley region will get wetter or drier. For the southern parts of Australia, the models are more conclusive. There will be less rain., But the models and the weather observations are clear, Henley says, that climate change is pushing temperatures ever higher., When you live in a tin house with not enough cash for air conditioners, you have to find different ways to cool down. Like running down to the dam, which is no longer safe to swim in., Fleur contacted local media about her town’s water problem and, along with Euchareena's progress association, started writing to the local council about their plight. In October 2019, Dubbo council applied for state government funding to pay for water to be carted by truck to residents., Now a truck rolls up every 21 days and drops 13,000 litres into the family’s water tank — an allowance of 100 litres a person each day, which cannot be used outside the home. , Fleur and Locky run a household with no alcohol, no drugs and no gambling, and they play a critical role in mentoring young Aboriginal people., “We are cultural knowledge holders and we have a responsibility to pass that on,” Fleur says., This means there will often be a lot more than just six people in the house, and it’s the reason why, every 18 days or so, there’s no water left in their tank. The family’s only option then are bottles., In January 2020, the strain of life without water became too great — the family moved away to Sydney. \"It's sad for us to have to move off country,\" says Fleur.

The outbreak is the largest for decades and has already devastated crops in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, countries with fragile food security. The problem is not confined to Africa, with swarms also occurring in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan., In the current outbreak, one swarm in Kenya measured 40km by 60km and as many as 150m locusts can gather in a square kilometre. It is estimated that even a small swarm can devour enough food for 35,000 people daily., When a single desert locust – actually a type of short-horned grasshopper in the family Acrididae – lives alone it is light brown in colour and does relatively little damage. However, when the environment is favourable (often after heavy rain and cyclones) and lots of locusts come together in the same place – they change colour to pink (immature) and then yellow (mature) and form swarms, a process known as gregarisation., There is no reliable way to tackle a swarm of locusts. Their occurrence and movements are hard to predict and they move very fast over large, often very remote areas. They can be sprayed with pesticide from planes and drones. The best tactic is to spray the locusts before the gregarisation process begins; Mauritania has been praised for taking this pre-emptive approach., Heavy rains help create perfect breeding conditions for locusts and these have been caused recently by a powerful cyclone off Somalia. Some forecasters suggest that an increase in the frequency of Indian Ocean cyclones could be due to global heating, which may lead to more regular swarming in Africa.the five things you need to know about locusts swarms east africa kenya somalia ethiopia pesticide", "label": 0}, "train-323": {"text": "\nSydney water restrictions to ease from 1 March following downpour\n, Drop from level 2 to level 1 restrictions announced after the ‘biggest rain event in 20 years’, Australian Associated Press, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 17.49 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2020 18.10 EST\n\n, Water restrictions will be relaxed across Sydney in a fortnight following the boost to dam levels from the “biggest rain event in 20 years”., The change from level 2 to level 1 restrictions will take effect from 1 March when water quality in the catchment’s dams is expected to have improved., “We recently experienced the biggest rain event in 20 years, which has impacted the quality of raw water in greater Sydney’s bushfire-affected catchment,” the water New South Wales minister, Melinda Pavey, said in a statement on Tuesday., “A number of initiatives are in place to ensure the water is safe for use, including extensive testing, filtration and nets to catch debris, but we are allowing an extra two weeks purely as a precautionary measure.”, Dam levels in greater Sydney have spiked after significant rainfalls in February, with overall storage now at 80.4%., Some 200mm of rain fell in the catchment in the past week alone., Sydney’s main Warragamba Dam is at 80.3%, which is almost 20 percentage points higher than a week ago., Prospect Dam is at 87.2% while Woronora Dam is at 63.6% capacity., Under level 1 water restrictions, residents and businesses are banned from leaving hoses running unattended, washing vehicles and buildings with a hose that isn’t fitted with a trigger nozzle or using standard sprinklers and watering systems., Fines will still apply for breaches – $220 for residential breaches and $550 for businesses., Under level 2 restrictions, gardens can only be watered before 10am or after 4pm with a watering can or bucket, hosing of hard surfaces is banned and cars can only be washed using a bucket or at a car wash.sydney water restrictions to ease from 1 march following downpour", "label": 0}, "train-324": {"text": "\nExtinction Rebellion digs up college's lawn in Cambridge – video\n, Climate protesters have dug up the lawn in front of Trinity's 16th-century great gate, saying the Cambridge college must 'cut ties with fossil fuel companies'., A spokeswoman for Trinity said a statement would be released later, as the week-long series of demonstrations gets underway, Source: Viral Press, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 13.32 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2020 03.08 EST\n\nextinction rebellion digs up colleges lawn in cambridge video", "label": 0}, "train-325": {"text": "\nWhy we must put flood defences before Johnson’s vanity projects\n, Letters, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 13.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2020 13.03 EST\n\n, Boris Johnson’s ambition to have some big ego project to memorialise him in the manner of great politicians and engineering projects of Victorian Britain would be better served by not building HS2 or indeed the barmy bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland., All those billions should be invested in major flood protection projects across the country (Flood alerts at new high as storm lashes UK, 17 February)., Storms Ciara and Dennis over the past two weekends have shown the need for much-improved flood defences and river management systems, a need which will become increasingly critical as the climate emergency worsens and such events regularly occur in ever greater measure., It is appalling to see the destruction of people’s homes, businesses and communities by flooding and storms. It is shocking to see the distress that people are suffering from the repetition of these inundations when they have barely recovered from earlier ones.

In contrast, the recently elected government, which has little if any credibility in responding to the climate emergency, considers that repeating imaginary figures as to their plans for the NHS, transport infrastructure, etc is acceptable., Maybe following all the climate catastrophes over the past weeks, there will finally be an urgent political awakening and necessary action to curtail the burning of fossil fuels.

The university said Wang and his team had increased that to 16.6%. It has been recognised as a record by the US National Energy Research Laboratory., Wang said the improvement of nearly 25% was a significant step towards the technology becoming commercially viable and supporting global efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions., “It is effectively the difference between quantum dot solar cell technology being an exciting prospect and being commercially viable,” he said., Wang said advantages of the technology compared to traditional solar cell technology included it being lightweight, flexible and able to work in weaker light, such as on cloudy days or under indoor lighting. He said it could be used for a range of applications, including cars and wearable technology, and was relatively cheap to produce., His team aims to increase the conversion efficiency to 20% and scale up the printing process to produce large solar cells., “Our immediate target is to try to further break the world record in this category,” Wang said., He said they hoped to develop a product that could be brought to market for small appliances, such as a phone, within two years, and within three to five years for large-scale power compatible with rooftop solar., Simon Holmes à Court, a senior advisor to the Energy Transition Hub at the University of Melbourne, said the technology would have to be cheaper and have a smaller environmental footprint than existing solar options to be successful., “There’s always a long list of reputed benefits for this kind of thing, but 99.9% of solar from here on goes either on people’s roofs or in fields in big solar farms,” he said. , The chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, John Grimes, said a lot of work had been done to try to come up with ways to make solar technology ubiquitous. He said traditional, silicon-based solar technologies were limited by being “fixed and brittle”., “There’s a huge potential market for this type of application,” he said. “At 16.6% efficiency, that’s really exciting. The solar most people have on their roof today is 19%.”, Grimes said existing silicon solar cells were already very cheap, making it a challenge for any new technology wanting to enter the market., “It’s a question of getting the economics right.

Her interest in plants and flowers began in the 1950s, when she studied at the Cambridge University Botany School. Her abilities were soon recognised and she became a research assistant to the distinguished academic Max Walters., From 1972 until 1986 she was employed on the Eastern England Rare Plant survey and developed the methodology on which all subsequent rare plant surveys have been based. This led to further research into historical records, culminating in the Cambridgeshire Flora catalogue, published online. Her many papers included studies of the Devil’s Dyke, Lakenheath Warren and Wicken Fen, all in East Anglia., Born Irmingard Richter in Munich, Gigi was the only child of Georg Richter, an American art historian, and his wife, Amalie (nee Zuendt von Kenzingen). Her godfather was the German novelist Thomas Mann, a close friend of her father’s. Before long the family moved to Florence, Italy, then to Britain, and (just as the second world war broke out in 1939) to New York., While in Britain Gigi had attended Hayes Court school, Kent, and the Westminster School of Art in London. Although her father hoped she would succeed as an artist, she felt that she had no real talent and in New York she trained in art conservation. The moment peace was declared (her father having died) she returned to London to work as a conservator, soon finding her feet in liberal political and artistic circles. In 1948 she travelled with the Berlin airlift to observe life under the blockade, and reported her findings in the September issue of Horizon magazine that year., The following year she married David “Buzzy” Crompton, a New Yorker, town planner, maker of harpsichords and croquet player. Buzzy’s sister Lady (Catherine) Walston, offered them the tenancy of a cottage on the Walston estate at Thriplow, Cambridgeshire, where the gardener took Gigi on as an unpaid apprentice. By 1956 her growing passion for plants led her to join the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland, of which she later became an honorary member., In 1965 the Cromptons bought a house at Commercial End, Swaffham Bulbeck, in the east of the county. There they planted specimen trees, now fully mature, as well as an orchard, and developed an exceptional kitchen garden and croquet lawn. They lived a contented life that seemed utterly English – although it was only late in life that Gigi became naturalised., At times autocratic, Gigi impressed many people with her kindness, enthusiastic ability to teach, capacity for scholarship, warmth of friendship, strength of mind and intolerance of stupidity., Buzzy died in 2007.gigi crompton obituary", "label": 0}, "train-329": {"text": "\nRiver insects and lichens bucking trend of wildlife losses\n, Reductions in air and water pollution are most likely reason, say scientists, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 11.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2020 05.10 EST\n\n, Freshwater insects, mosses and lichens are bucking the trend of wildlife losses in the UK and have expanded their ranges since 1970, according to a new study. Reductions in air and water pollution are the most likely reason., Scientists say their new analysis shows that amid big declines in wildlife, action can help to reverse the trend for some species. The work analysed millions of sightings of 5,000 different invertebrate species by volunteers over 45 years., The research also found that the average range of insects had increased over that time. This finding does not conflict with other reports of serious declines in insect populations, the scientists said. The new analysis considered only whether a species was present or absent from a site, while the other studies measured falls in abundance and, for example, a population could fall by 90% and still occupy the same range., The scientists also said much wildlife had already been lost by 1970, which means that date is a low baseline. The pressures on invertebrate life, as well as better studied mammals and birds, include destruction of natural habitats, pollution and pesticides and, increasingly, the impacts of the climate crisis., “By looking at long-term trends in the distribution of understudied species, we found evidence of concerning declines but we also found that it’s not all bad news,” said Charlie Outhwaite at University College London, who led the new research., The areas in which freshwater insects, such as mayflies, dragonflies and caddisflies, were found plunged by 47% from 1970 to 1994, but have expanded strongly since and were 7% higher in 2015 than 50 years ago. “That coincides with the implementation of the EU urban wastewater treatment directive”, which significantly cleaned up rivers, Outhwaite said., Mosses and lichens have expanded their average range by 36% since 1970, the study found. “Mosses and lichens are very sensitive to air quality and it seems like they have been improving” since the Clean Air Act in 1956, she said., The 3,000 species of terrestrial insects analysed experienced a slight increase of 5% in their range since 1970. But Outhwaite said: “We just looked at range and not the number of individuals. So it’s very possible that there are still huge declines happening in terms of the number of individuals.”, “We just don’t have abundance data for most invertebrate species, especially at a national scale,” she said. “So we’ve had to do the best we can by looking at their range size. But it’s really important we don’t over-interpret it and think everything’s fine.”, The new work, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, also shows that the ranges of many insect groups in the UK have declined since the mid-2000s. Other research has shown big falls in insect populations since that time, which was when neonicotinoid pesticides were introduced., “The trends in bees seen in this new study mirror the bee trends found in our 2019 research,” said Gary Powney, at the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, which was not part of the latest work. “The rapid and substantial decline in these pollinators in the late 2000s is a major cause for concern.”, Other groups losing range in the new analysis included spiders and freshwater snails and mussels. The molluscs did not recover after 1994, Outhwaite said, “so something else is driving that change, potentially invasive species”. But fungus gnats and weevils showed strong expansion of their ranges., Determining the exact causes of changes is difficult, she said: “It’s challenging because you have multiple threats happening at the same time.”, Prof Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new study, said data collected by volunteer recorders had to be treated carefully. “Recorder effort has greatly increased in recent years, along with the publication of new identification books, online guides, recording apps and so on,” he said. “Obviously the more you look, and the more experienced the recorder, the more you will find. The modelling purports to take this into account, but I do not see how.”, The relationship between the range and abundance of species is not clear, Goulson said, although they would be expected to track one another. But the new work suggests range could expand for some species while their abundance falls. “All in all, it’s very puzzling,” he said., “This kind of data is very messy in terms of biases, like sampling effort over time,” said Outhwaite. “But the models are designed to try to take those into account, so they don’t influence our trends.”, She also paid tribute to the volunteer recorders. “Our study demonstrates the power of citizen science, as anyone can contribute to impactful research. There are over 80 recording schemes in the UK now, so there is definitely something for you if you are interested.”river insects and lichens bucking trend of wildlife losses", "label": 0}, "train-330": {"text": "\nIreland revokes licence of livestock ship operator over low performance rating\n, Decision concerns two ships regularly transporting live animals to the Middle East, prompting questions about monitoring of fleet, Sophie Kevany, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 10.39 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2020 06.57 EST\n\n, The Irish government revoked approvals for the operator of two regular livestock carriers, the Atlantic M and the Express 1, last week, following questions from the Guardian and Irish farm animal welfare organisation Ethical Farming Ireland (EFI). , Internal emails appear to show that Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) was unaware that the performance ratings for the ships’ operator was below the required standard until a campaigner from EFI got in touch last year., Last week DAFM told the Guardian it had written to the “owner/operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1 regarding the department’s intention to revoke their approval … once the department became aware of the performance rating”., “The operator was given 14 days to make representations”, the email went on to say, before the “owners/operator’s approval was subsequently revoked”., Ireland’s exports of dairy, beef and livestock are a pillar of its agri-food sector. The latest figures from Bord Bia, the Irish food board, show agri-food products account for 10% of total exports. International sales of meat and livestock earned the country almost €4bn (£3.3bn) in 2019., Shipping is an opaque and complex area, however, all the more so when live animals are involved. In 2016, to complement EU law, Ireland introduced another layer of regulation on the carriage of livestock by sea., The regulations stipulate that the performance level of companies operating livestock vessels “must not be listed as ‘low or very low’ on the performance tables of Port State Control published by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)”., But the operator of the Atlantic M and the Express 1, two ships that regularly carry livestock from Ireland, fell into EMSA’s “low or very low” bracket. The EMSA website and Panama-based shipping registration service, PMA Certification, show both vessels are operated by Turkish company Emiroglu Deniz Nakliyati. The list is updated daily and relates to the previous 36 months., The Guardian contacted DAFM to ask for more information about the situation. On 10 February the department replied, saying that it had revoked the operator’s approval for both ships. Questions about the future of both ships, or the approval of a new operator, were not answered., Emails seen by the Guardian indicate that the DAFM was previously unaware that the safety and compliance manager for the Atlantic M and Express 1 was on the EMSA’s “low or very low performance” list., The monitoring gap allowed livestock shipments to continue as normal in the preceding months. In the emails the management for the ships expressed surprise at the sudden approvals revocation in early 2020, given that the vessels had already “loaded from Ireland many times”, and each time the DAFM had inspected the vessels, “we get approval, so what happened now?”, In an interview with the Guardian, the ships’ former safety management company, the Istanbul-based Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyatı, confirmed that the DAFM had revoked their approval in January this year because the company was on the EMSA’s low-performing list. Explaining the rating, Emiroğlu Deniz Nakliyati’s operations manager Erhan Çavdar said this had followed the detainment of some of its ships. One of the detained ships was the Atlantic M., Caroline Rowley of EFI told the Guardian she had emailed the DAFM on 30 December, raising concerns about the Atlantic M and the Express 1. The same day, the DAFM raised those concerns with the ships’ management in an email marked “urgent”. , Earlier in December, Rowley had also notified the DAFM about problems with the operator of a third Irish livestock carrier, the Sarah M. At that point, the Sarah M was operated by the Beirut Shipping Company, whose performance was listed by EMSA as “low or very low”. The Sarah M is now operated by DMS lines, which is not on the low or very low listing., Despite Rowley’s emails, which the department acknowledged, the next Sarah M cattle shipment went ahead at the end of 2019., The Guardian tried to contact the Beirut Shipping Company, but was told by Farouk El Murr, who works for the Sarah M’s current operator, DMS Lines, based at the same address, that the Beirut Shipping Company had closed in “late December, early January”. El Murr said the closure had come “after its licence was revoked by the Irish DAFM because it was on the low or very low performing EMSA list”.,  An Irish marine law expert, who has asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian that the Irish carriage of livestock regulations appeared to make no provision for monitoring any changes to an operator’s rating. Nor, the lawyer said, do they appear to require an operator to inform the DAFM if it is placed on the EMSA’s “low or very low performance” list after it has been approved., Responding to the lawyer’s comments, the DAFM said the “system for the approval of vessels for the carriage of livestock in Ireland involves a comprehensive inspection by a marine surveyor and by a departmental veterinarian to determine the suitability of the vessel for that particular purpose”., “In addition to that, the department requires the vessel to have a valid classification certificate issued by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. This is clearly not the sole requirement for approval.”, Rowley fears that if she had not contacted the DAFM, “these vessels would still be operating in breach of regulations with the department being none the wiser.”, She said there is a wider issue in the way that these regulations are being monitored and what seems to be a gap between what the agriculture department says and what it does. “The DAFM prides itself on its exceptionally high standards. But when we see vessels with operating companies that don’t meet the criteria, vessels transferred to new operators just a few weeks after we send emails, we have to wonder whether anyone really cares about those animals.”, An internal document appears to justify some of her concerns about the DAFM prioritising appearances. Although undated, a slide from a DAFM presentation seen by the Guardian, titled “Changes for 2019”, says it expects animal exporters to “comply fully with legislative requirements and minimise opportunities for NGOs and the European Commission to criticise and complain about Ireland’s compliances”.ireland revokes license of livestock ship operator over low performance rating", "label": 0}, "train-331": {"text": "\nStorm Dennis floods: how bad are they and what is being done?\n, There are questions over capability of flood defences and how money is being spent, \nJosh Halliday North of England correspondent, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 08.25 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2020 17.54 EST\n\n, Storm Dennis is believed to have caused the worst winter floods in recent times, in part because the rain was so widespread but also because it has fallen on ground already saturated from Storm Ciara the previous week. Storm Dennis affected huge swaths of Britain, from the Scottish Highlands to the Cornish coast and large parts of Wales and Northern Ireland. It triggered a record-breaking number of Environment Agency flood warnings and alerts in England on Sunday., The Environment Agency says its flood defences – both permanent and temporary measures – are working. It says that as many as 20,000 properties have been protected from storms Ciara and Dennis due to these measures. However, Britain has experienced an exceptionally wet winter and many rural areas, including towns and villages, have been left vulnerable to the higher river levels and saturated ground. Also, physical flood structures are only one part of the armoury., Flood barriers are a small but important part of the protection from devastating storms. Experts say that while Britain can never be fully flood-proof, much more could be done to better protect those in vulnerable areas. One way is to have a robust planning policy that keeps new housing developments out of flood plains. Another is natural flood management, such as planting trees, building “leaky dams” and water storage facilities. These all help slow the flow of water downstream and would take the edge off severe storms , said Prof Hannah Cloke, of the University of Reading. Prof Robert Wilby, of Loughborough University, said natural flood management would help mitigate small floods but would be overwhelmed by the likes of Ciara and Dennis., Another important tool is forecasting: the Met Office’s new £1.2bn supercomputer could be a game-changer in predicting the areas most at risk of flooding. Experts say more energy should be devoted to contingency planning, local resilience measures and regular maintenance of flood defences and drainage systems., The government says it invests in areas of the highest priority. Critics say this often means protecting urban areas or properties of high commercial value, at the expense of rural communities, farms and villages. One problem is the fluctuating amount of money set aside for flood prevention each year, which means agencies cannot plan too far ahead or invest in radical changes to the landscape. In early 2019, the Environment Agency said at least £1bn a year was needed to tackle flooding and coastal erosion – more than the £600m-£800m a year that has been spent since 2010., Boris Johnson’s government has committed to spending £4bn on the issue over the next five years but experts argue that a more ambitious programme needs to be implemented, looking at a broader range of defence mechanisms. “Hard flood defences are just a tiny part of what we should be doing,” said Cloke. “There’s no realistic way we can manage future flooding with hard flood defences – we really need to be thinking more than that.”, The recent floods have been so widespread and damaging because the ground across Britain is saturated. It has been an exceptionally wet winter so far with autumn rainfall records being broken for South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. England as a whole had its fifth wettest autumn on record. Why? In large part, this is due to the climate emergency. Evidence from the Met Office shows the number of winter storms has increased in the north Atlantic and that they are getting stronger. Heavy rainfall events are also becoming more frequent: warmer air carries more moisture, which means rain falls in heavier showers.storm dennis floods everything you need to know", "label": 0}, "train-332": {"text": "\nRanulph Fiennes labels trophy hunters 'bullying bastards' and calls for UK import ban\n, Explorer says halting imports would recognise the devastating impact of colonialism on wildlife, \nPatrick Greenfield, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n, Banning the import and export of big game hunting trophies would recognise the destructive impact European powers have had on wildlife in former African and Asian colonies, Sir Ranulph Fiennes has said., Speaking to the Guardian, the veteran British explorer said hunting endangered species such as rhinos, elephants and lions to keep their body parts as trophies should be viewed with the same scepticism as Chinese traditional medicine in terms of the damage it does to biodiversity., The 75-year-old explorer, who spent a large part of his childhood in South Africa, has called for trophy hunting to be “stopped country by country” and said efforts to halt the extinction of wildlife around the world were hypocritical while big game hunting was still allowed., Reflecting on his early years in Cape Town and the influence of the British empire on trophy hunting, Fiennes said: “Just as much as the Belgians in the Congo and the French elsewhere, they unleashed the plague of persecuting animals – not like the locals did to eat, but purely for the pleasure of killing. That started the devastating damage to many, many wonderful species.”, Comparing trophy hunting with the demand for ingredients such as powdered rhino horn in traditional medicine in Asia, he added: “It’s not medically proven in any way. And yes, it goes on. China is particularly guilty, as are South Korea and many other countries in that area., “You’ve got the empire lot and the weird medical quack lot both going on to this current day and it’s got to be stopped country by country. We can stop it in the UK at least and thereby feel slightly less guilty because of our ancestors.”, Fiennes’s comments come during a consultation by the British government on applying controls to trophy hunting, including a proposal to ban imports, that was laid out in the Queen’s speech. In the wake of the death of Cecil the lion in 2015, France, Netherlands and Australia introduced bans on the import of lion trophies., Last year, the Guardian revealed lion bones, leopard skulls and an ottoman chair’s elephant leather were among the 74 rare animal body parts legally brought into the UK in 2018., Under international rules overseen by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), trophies can be moved around the world if they do not affect the survival of a species., Fiennes said: “Bearing in mind that climate change is helping to remove animals and in 50 years time probably humans as well, now is the time for us to get into a position without being hypocritical., “We are all hoping that Boris will see that cruelty is what we’re talking about – bullying bastards are involved and people who are vain sticking lovely dead animals on their walls.”, In America, Donald Trump has previously spoken out against big-game trophy hunting despite Donald Trump Jr being a keen hunter. A week-long “dream hunt” with the US president’s son was auctioned off earlier this month at an annual trophy hunting convention organised by Safari Club International (SCI), where it went for $150,000. Another lot offered the chance to shoot an elephant on a 14-day trip to Namibia., Supporters of trophy hunting such as SCI argue that the practise supports conservation efforts for endangered wildlife. The organisation said it had written to the governments of Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe in relation to the proposed trophy hunting import ban in the UK., When contacted by the Guardian about the trophy hunting consultation that ends on 25 February, a Defra spokesperson said: “Following the pre-election and Christmas periods, we are extending the trophy hunting consultation by one month to ensure all interested parties are able to have their say.”, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresranulph fiennes labels trophy hunters bullying bastards and calls for uk import ban aoe", "label": 0}, "train-333": {"text": "\nBeavers cut flooding and pollution and boost wildlife populations\n, Five-year study of animals in Devon finds measurable benefits to wildlife and people, \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n, Beavers have alleviated flooding, reduced pollution and boosted populations of fish, amphibians and other wildlife, according to a five-year study of wild-living animals in Devon., The report, which will help the government decide whether to allow wild beavers to return to England after being hunted to extinction more than 400 years ago, concludes that the species has brought measurable benefits to wildlife and people., The study, by a team of scientists overseen by Prof Richard Brazier of the University of Exeter, concludes that beavers’ quantifiable benefits on the River Otter, including eco-tourism and “ecosystem services” such as flood alleviation, outweigh costs such as the minor flooding of some farmland., The beavers, which escaped from a captive population, were discovered in 2013 living wild on the river. When plans to exterminate the animals were greeted by a popular outcry, the government agreed to a scientific trial, with the funds entirely raised by Devon Wildlife Trust and its supporters., The number of beavers on the Otter has risen from two breeding pairs in 2015 to at least eight pairs today as the herbivorous rodent has expanded along tributaries including the River Tale., The beavers’ positive impact includes one family constructing six dams upstream of the flood-prone village of East Budleigh. The dams have slowed the flow of floodwater through the village, reducing “peak flows” during flood events., The scientists also found that the beavers played a significant role in filtering pollutants including manure, slurry and fertilisers from the river, while new wetlands created by the beavers have benefited water voles, riverine birds such as dippers and wildfowl including teal. There were 37% more fish in pools created by beaver dams than in comparable stretches of river. Trout have been recorded leaping over beaver dams during high river flows., While beavers prevent flooding by slowing floodwater flows, their dams can also flood valuable valley farmland. The study identified an “adverse impact” at just five sites in the 250km2 river catchment over five years., In one case, a small organic potato field was flooded. Riverside orchards were also at risk from beavers gnawing the trees, but negative impacts were mostly solved with active management., Wire guards were provided to protect trees while Devon Wildlife Trust and Clinton Devon Estates – a supportive local landowner – occasionally removed beaver dams or installed “beaver deceivers” to prevent flooding. Beaver deceivers are pipes that carry water through beaver dams without the beavers realising, to lower water levels and stop flooding., “Following five years of detailed research work, the report concludes that the positive impacts of beavers outweighed the negatives,” said Brazier. “However, it also makes clear that those who benefit from beaver reintroduction may not always be the same people as those who bear the costs, highlighting that the reduction of flood risk in communities downstream may come at a cost of water being stored on farmland upstream.”, Mark Elliott, who led the River Otter beaver trial for Devon Wildlife Trust, said: “We’ve all been surprised by these amazing animals’ ability to thrive, once again, in our wetland ecosystems. It also shows their unrivalled capacity to breathe new life into our rivers and wetlands, very few of which are in good health., “There are overwhelming reasons why beavers should be reintroduced back into the wider countryside.”, According to Elliott, the key to successfully returning the beaver across England will be to provide support for affected landowners, so that those who lose small areas of farmland to flooding will not incur financial losses., In recent months the government has licensed dozens of schemes for wild beavers to be placed in large fenced areas in valleys to help with flood alleviation and restoring wildlife., But Elliott said the next step would be for the government to approve wild releases into particular river catchments. “We’re not zookeepers, we’re conservationists and it’s a native species to Britain so we shouldn’t be having to keep them in with fences in the long-term,” he said., Tony Juniper, chair of Natural England, said: “It is fantastic to see the successful reintroduction of these majestic creatures back into the English countryside, which Natural England has licensed. I commend the work of the Devon Wildlife Trust in helping to show how beavers can have such a transformative impact on the natural world., “This is a massive step towards boosting the richness of wildlife around the River Otter, reducing pollution, mitigating flooding and making this landscape more resilient to climate change.”, The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has announced an extension of the Devon trial until September, when it will decide if the Devon beavers can remain., If Defra backs the beavers, it is likely that a new licensing system will enable the release of free-living beavers in other river catchments – with the beaver officially recognised as a native species again.beavers cut flooding and pollution and boost wildlife populations", "label": 0}, "train-334": {"text": "\nCountry diary 1945: jackdaw hullabaloo on the fell\n, 19 February 1945 The birds can never keep silent, not even when they strut around the boy spreading the manure, George Muller, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 26 Mar 2020 10.19 EDT\n\n, Cumberland, February 17No matter what time you pass a craggy, terraced fell rising steeply from a main road you hear a clamour that now and again is almost deafening. The jackdaws have no matins or vespers like hounds sitting together on a kennel bench. They can never keep silent, not even when they strut around the boy spreading the manure in the fertile land at the head of the lake. This fell is their breeding-place, and though it may be another two months before they lay their eggs in the holes from which the village lads will extract them with long spoons they are indulging in aerial displays that dunlin might well envy., The jackdaws are the noisy neighbours of a pair or two of carrion crows who find it impossible to outshout them, and the carrion, lurching himself forward on the top of a fir to call to his mate, is no mean performer.

Environment, says the IMO should stop the use of scrubbers until it can answer key questions about how discharges may affect health., “Ships should not be allowed to use scrubbers if the IMO has no idea what the consequences will be for human health and food chain contamination,” she said., “The surge in scrubber use means that increasing amounts of PAHs will accumulate in sediment over time, and no one knows what the impact on human health will be., “It is going to have an impact on the food chain and, as things stand, we have no reliable information about when safe threshold limits will be breached.”, Christopher Elliott, a professor at the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen’s University Belfast, believes the effect of bioaccumulation of PAHs in the food chain is a worrying issue., “Any increase in PAHs at the bottom of the food chain can have a negative impact on human health over the long term, damaging immune systems and potentially increasing susceptibility to cancer,” he said., Shipping companies have repeatedly said that they have commissioned rigorous studies to test pollutants discharged by scrubbers., Earlier this year a study commissioned by Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) Europe, the world’s largest cruise industry trade association, concluded that “exhaust gas cleaning systems have a limited impact on water quality”., In March last year Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise company, published a study that described scrubbers as “a safe and effective” way of complying with the recently implemented regulations for cleaner air emissions., The Clean Shipping Alliance, a lobby group for companies that have invested in exhaust gas cleaning technology, says it believes that sufficient research has been conducted and discharges from the devices are safe for marine ecosystems., “There is well-documented evidence relating to the composition of scrubber washwater,” a spokesperson said., However, in the IMO’s new internal report it criticises the existing body of research that been published based on analysis of chemical discharge from the devices, saying that some of the existing studies cannot be trusted., “In a number of reports, no basic information was provided either on the sampling techniques, or on the quality assurance and control of the analytical methods used,” it says., “Lack of all this information put a great uncertainty on a number of presented results and the quality of the provided data could not be fully judged and trusted.”, Gilliam says many of the existing studies looking at chemical discharges from scrubbers have been done by entities that benefit financially from the use of them., “In some cases they are commissioning studies by independent groups, but the samples are being collected by their own staff,” she said., “How do we know exactly where they are taking the sample from, at what time, at what engine load? We don’t have those answers. It can’t be regarded as rigorous, independent, peer-reviewed research., “We don’t know if this will be a health crisis in 20 or 30 years, because proper research just hasn’t been done.”, A spokeswoman for CLIA said: “Cruise lines are committed to environmental stewardship and have invested more than £16bn in ships with new technologies and cleaner fuels to reduce air emissions and achieve greater energy efficiencies., “Exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS), which are designed to remove 98% of sulphur and well over 50% of particulate matter from exhaust, have been proven safe for maritime environments. Publicly available studies on the long-term impact of discharges from exhaust gas cleaning systems have found minimal environmental impact on water and sediment quality when benchmarked against new European environmental quality standards entering into force in 2021.”, In October, the British Ports Association warned that the use of scrubbers by shipping companies could render some UK ports unusable by contaminating sediment and increasing the cost of dredging., The IMO is due to discuss future regulation of scrubbers at a meeting starting on Monday. shipping pollution regulations could harm food chain", "label": 0}, "train-336": {"text": "\nErdoğan’s ‘crazy project': new Istanbul canal to link Black and Marmara Seas\n, \nErdoğan’s ‘crazy project': new Istanbul canal to link Black and Marmara Seas\n, Proposed route slices through a major drinking water source and an important stop for migratory birds , Tessa Fox, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 9 Mar 2020 05.57 EDT\n\n, To the west of Istanbul, between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, lie diverse landscapes of forest, farms, marshes and ancient settlements. Following a curving line from north to south would connect you through the Terkos Lake, Sazlıdere stream and reservoir and Küçükçekmece lagoon, important water sources for migratory birds – not to mention the city’s residents., This line, however, is also the path of Kanal İstanbul, a $12.6bn(£9.7bn) mega-infrastructure plan described by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as his “crazy project” when he first mentioned the idea in 2011., Kanal İstanbul, approved by the environment ministry last month, would be a 45km (28 mile) shipping canal joining the Black Sea to the Marmara, running parallel to the Bosphorus strait, which already cuts through the centre of Istanbul. The government says the canal is needed to reduce water traffic through the city., Critics – who include the mayor of Istanbul – warn of a great environmental cost, including the potential ecological destruction of the Marmara Sea. There is a delicate ecological balance between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, currently connected by the Bosphorus strait., “The salinity of Black Sea is less than Marmara Sea, and the organic content of Black Sea is much higher than that of Marmara Sea,” says Cevahir Efe Akçelik, Istanbul secretary of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects., Because the Black Sea is 50cm higher than the Marmara, both the level and salinity density would change if the two were connected by the canal., Not only that, the flow of cellular organisms into the Marmara would eat up extra oxygen., The loss of oxygen could see bacteria and other organisms create a sulphurous gas, the scent of which could spread across Istanbul like rotten eggs. And there are fears it could wipe out life in the Marmara entirely., “Some oceanographers say 30 years later there will be no oxygen left in the Marmara Sea. It’s a really harmful and dangerous project.” said Akçelik, One section also directly threatens Istanbul’s water supply. Terkos Lake and Sazlıdere reservoir provide a quarter of the city’s drinking water; the city has drawn water from the lake since the Roman period and it has always been regarded symbolically as Istanbul’s main water source., Should those reserves be lost, Akçelik says, there is no alternative water source on the European side of Istanbul. Instead the government would have to pump water from the Sakarya River, deep on the Asian side., That would be much more expensive. It also carries health hazards, given the river passes through Turkey’s capital, Ankara, and through polluted industrial areas to reach the Black Sea., The canal would also destroy Küçükçekmece lagoon, which in turn could see hundreds of different species vanish, scientists warn. The lagoon is an important stop for migratory birds, particularly the Cetti’s warbler, grey heron, eastern imperial eagle and the flamingo, who all lay their eggs in Küçükçekmece., “If you lose that lake, you lose not only a drinking water source, but a really important ecology,” Akçelik says., The Turkish government finalised the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for Kanal Istanbul, declaring it did not foresee any issues with the project. , The ministry of environment and urbanisation opened the project to public consultation. More than 70,000 people signed a petition against it., But in January the ministry approved approved it anyway., The mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, who is affiliated with Turkey’s main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), has been at loggerheads over the project with Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP)., İmamoğlu has started to campaign publicly against the canal, and the municipality is taking legal action to halt construction., According to the head of the zoning and urbanisation department, Gürkan Akgün, the objections made by public institutions, non-governmental organisations and residents have been ignored., “The north end of Istanbul is the life support system for all of us,” he says. “It all will disappear irreversibly with this project.”, He argues that the ministry’s report contains “erroneous assumptions and insufficient analytical surveys” and says the city is appealing the decision., Greenpeace has submitted an appeal of its own., “In many respects, Istanbul, one of the most important and unique cities in the world, is going to be thrown into disaster with this unpredictable project,” says Greenpeace’s Mediterranean program director, Deniz Bayram., The national government and the city’s ministry for environment and urbanisation did not respond to requests for comment. , Erdoğan has said there is no alternative to the Kanal İstanbul project for limiting traffic through the Bosphorus, and claimed all appropriate environmental and technical surveys have been undertaken., The Bosphorus strait is an internationally important shipping route. Around 48,000 ships pass through its waters annually, including oil tankers and war ships. The government claims there are risks posed by ships carrying dangerous goods., Critics note, however, that fewer ships have been using the strait of late. “In the last 10 years, traffic decreased by 10%,” Akçelik says., The construction of new petroleum and natural gas pipelines between countries has meant less reliance on ships and tankers to transport resources., Accidents have been falling as well, according to municipal officials, who point to improvements in maritime transport and shipping sector technology. “For many years, we have not encountered a serious accident in the Bosphorus and I hope we will not in the future,” Akgün says., Akçelik says he believes the true long-term aim of the canal, rather than easing shipping traffic, is to create a major infrastructure project north of the city to spur development., “The main idea is creating a new city in northern Istanbul,” Akçelik explained., Akgün agrees and says he believes the new works will significantly disrupt the area’s climate. “The construction areas to be formed around it will transform into an urban heat island, changing the temperature, humidity, evaporation and wind regimes in a very short time,” he says., “Considering all these points, it becomes clearer what kind of an environmental disaster we are facing.”canal istanbul erdogans crazy plan to plot route between black and marmara seas", "label": 0}, "train-337": {"text": "\nCountry diary: 'It's time, it's time,' calls the skylark, a signal spring is here\n, Caistor St Edmund, Norfolk: Most of us are content to listen from below.

This time, none of that support at all has been forthcoming,” she said., “His refusal to call a Cobra meeting has really hampered the recovery of lots of different communities up and down the country, not least of all mine.”, As Downing Street came under pressure to act, the government announced measures late on Tuesday to help flood victims. They included an invitation to apply for up to £500 in “financial hardship payments”, council tax and business rates relief and access to funds of up to £2,500 to cover some uninsurable losses., Ministers also said flood-hit homes and businesses would be able to apply for up to £5,000 to “help make them more resilient to future flooding”, while a cross-Whitehall flood recovery taskforce was due to begin meeting this week., More than 300 flood warnings and alerts remain in place across Britain, including eight warning of danger to life in England and south Wales, as Johnson faced a second day of political pressure over his response to the storms., Evacuations were under way along the River Severn in Shropshire and 33 people were rescued from a care home in Herefordshire as rainfall from Storm Dennis continued to cause widespread damage and disruption., One of the severe flood warnings centred on the historic town of Ironbridge, near Telford in Shropshire, where residents were being evacuated over concerns that the swollen river would soon top a 6.8-metre temporary flood barrier on Tuesday night., Shaun Davies, the Labour leader of Telford &amp; Wrekin council, said his local authority was having to carry out tasks usually organised by the Environment Agency – such as distributing sandbags and erecting flood barriers – because the agency was so stretched., He said: “What would be really helpful is if government were able to show some national leadership on this issue. What we need from the centre is some very practical support. It sounds very basic but sandbags and access to sand – there’s been no central resource that we have been made aware of so we are securing that but at a great premium.”, Six people are thought to have died in the flooding. The sixth was named on Monday night as Yvonne Booth, 55, from Birmingham, who was swept into flood water near Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire on Sunday. Her family said they were devastated and appreciated the continued support from the emergency services., Downing Street said on Monday that Johnson had no plans to visit any of the areas affected by flooding from Storm Dennis, and would instead spend the day working from a country house in Kent. A No 10 spokesman said he was being kept updated from Chevening, a government-owned historic property near Sevenoaks being used while work is continuing at Chequers, the official prime ministerial country retreat., The new environment secretary, George Eustice, has defended the government’s response to the storms, insisting it has a “firm grip” and that flood defences were “working as intended”., In the past year, he said, new flood-response infrastructure had protected more than 200,000 properties, with a further 100,000 due to be protected. The government had also pledged an extra £4bn in funding for flood defences over the next five years, said Eustice., Thirty-three people were evacuated from a care home in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, as the River Wye reached its highest level since 1795, according to the county council leader, David Hitchiner., The council’s Conservative group leader, Jonathan Lester, said he did not believe sending ministers to flood-stricken areas was particularly important but said central government could do more to direct a “joined-up” approach between the various agencies on the ground., “I think after the floods have subsided and the lessons have been learned, more needs to be done in having this strategic approach and direction as to how best local authorities and agencies cope with this situation going forward,” he said. “I would welcome a strategy from government.”pms refusal to call cobra meeting hampering storm recovery", "label": 0}, "train-339": {"text": "\nHow should Jeff Bezos invest his $10bn Earth Fund?\n, Scientists propose best use of funds pledged by Amazon founder to fight climate crisis, \nJonathan Watts, \n\nTue 18 Feb 2020 11.44 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2020 14.31 EST\n\n, Amazon revenue to restore the Amazon rainforest? A political war chest in the US to counter the pernicious influence of big oil? Or research funding for “moonshot” technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere?, The world’s richest man is never going to be short of suggestions for how to spend money, but Jeff Bezos’s announcement of a new $10bn (£7.67bn) Earth Fund to fight global heating has raised the question of what is the best bang for a climate buck., In an Instagram post to his 1.4 million followers, the Amazon founder said he would start distributing funds this summer and hoped to work alongside scientists, activists and NGOs to “amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet”., The fund is controversial. Some campaigners believe Bezos – whose personal net worth is almost $130bn – should have used the money to pay more in taxes, or higher wages., Others suggest the creation of a political fighting fund to counter the influence of lobbyists in the oil and gas industry, who have delayed climate action for decades. The top five petrochemical companies spend about $200m a year on advertising, briefing and campaign donations aimed at blocking carbon taxes, extolling the benefits of their industry and misleading the public about the risks., “At this point, I think confronting the fossil fuel industry head-on – and the financial industry that supports it – is what is required,” said the US author, environmentalist and founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben. “If a plutocrat was willing to do that, it would be an interesting battle of titans. I’m not holding my breath, however.”, Counterintuitively, the high-tech multibillionaire is urged to invest in natural solutions. Studies have shown one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce carbon dioxide is to protect forests and support indigenous and traditional community land rights., “Strengthening the Amazon and other rainforests is vital if the world is to have any chance of stabilising the climate. When healthy they are the biggest terrestrial carbon sink. When attacked by fire, they are a huge source of emissions,” said Marcelo Salazar of Brazil’s biggest environment NGO, Instituto Socioambiental., He said “Amazon for the Amazon” funding could be used to shift the rainforest towards a new model of business and governance that relied less on destructive practices like deforestation and mining, and more on the renewable use of biodiverse fruits, nuts and natural oils that would allow indigenous people and other forest guardians to thrive., Another proposal is to develop game-changing technologies that are too risky for business or too expensive for governments. “Many emerging technologies, like carbon capture and storage, need a financial shot in the arm to get them scaled up fast. Other solutions, such as the expansion of climate-smart farming or universal wastewater treatment, may be less eye-catching but they are no less crucial in terms of cutting emissions and providing greater resilience to the impacts of climate change,” said Prof Dave Reay, executive director of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation., Prof Richard Templer, director of innovation at the Grantham Institute, said his “cheeky suggestion” would be that the money be committed to areas where science demands action but markets do not yet exist, such as removing carbon dioxide from the air and restoring habitats – including forests and wetlands – that can reduce emissions., New technology should not be necessary. Bob Ward, also of the Grantham Institute, suggested Bezos use the fund to overcome societal obstacles to net zero emissions through a global programme of research, analysis and engagement. “Some of this money should be targeted at the United States, Canada and Australia to, for instance, support local media to report and counter misinformation about the local impacts of climate change, and to build support for climate action among centre-right politicians and their supporters. The money should also be targeted at exploring options for managing a just transition among workers and communities around the world that are currently dependent on high-carbon industries,” he said., Owen Gaffney, an analyst and strategist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the Stockholm Resilience Centre said the key was to instil trust in liberal democracies to allow them to make big long-term decisions for the benefit of most people. “This means investing in solutions to reduce inequality and pricing carbon fairly,” he said., Climate economists said more support for carbon pricing had the greater potential to trigger a wave of positive developments. “Carbon pricing can do three things: make fossil fuel use less attractive, make clean technologies more profitable, and generate income for governments to give back to their citizens by means of tax cuts or infrastructure investments,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, the director of the Potsdam Institute. “That’s no easy thing. Yet this is why it needs some push.”, McKibben said the world’s richest man would probably never have taken this step without pressure from a staff organisation, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. This advocacy group has criticised their boss for supporting the oil and gas industry and for donating money to business groups that have lobbied against climate action. Earlier this year, 340 of them risked being fired by signing an online petition against Amazon rules that bar employees from speaking about the company’s business without approval from management., In response to Bezos’s announcement of the new fund, the group called for action as well as money., “We applaud Jeff Bezos’s philanthropy, but one hand cannot give what the other is taking away,” the group said in a statement. “The people of Earth need to know: when is Amazon going to stop helping oil &amp; gas companies ravage Earth with still more oil and gas wells?”, One idea is for Bezos to channel the $10bn through this group of climate justice advocates inside his company. “The mere fact that he thought it necessary to do this is because so many people – including his employees – have been organising so powerfully. So, in the end, I’ll put my faith in movements, not money,” McKibben said.how should jeff bezos invest his 10bn earth fund amazon climate crisis", "label": 0}, "train-340": {"text": "\nHive heists: why the next threat to bees is organized crime\n, Pollination has become big business, and thieves are now targeting hives with growing sophistication in the US, \nOliver Milman in Modesto, California, \n\nTue 18 Feb 2020 04.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2020 12.20 EST\n\n, Mike Potts was aware he was at risk of being a victim of crime, he just didn’t think it would happen to him. But Potts is an owner of an increasingly valuable commodity that thieves are targeting with growing sophistication in the US: bees., A booming demand for honeybees for pollination drew Potts, owner of Pottsy’s Pollination in Oregon, to load 400 hives of his bees on trucks and drive them down to California’s agricultural heartland last month. He unloaded them to a holding area just outside Yuba City and returned just a few days later to find 92 hives had been whisked away by thieves., “I pulled in the yard and noticed that there was some stuff missing,” said Potts, who estimated the theft cost him $44,000. Police subsequently pulled over three suspicious beekeepers traveling late at night, to no avail. “I’ve heard that there had been some stealing but didn’t think it would happen to me. It’s frustrating because it’s getting harder and harder to keep bees alive. And then you transport them down and they just get taken.”, The theft is the latest in a string of beehive heists, often undertaken at the dead of night using forklifts and trucks. Hives are regularly split open or dismantled, interventions that can kill tens of thousands of the kidnapped bees. The problem has become severe enough in California that certain police officers now specialize in hive crime., “Hive theft has always been an issue but it has definitely increased over the last eight years,” said Rowdy Freeman, a Butte county police officer who is commonly referred to as “bee theft detective”. Freeman has compiled figures showing there was an explosion in California hive thefts in 2016, with 1,695 being taken, compared with 101 in 2015. In 2017, the figure was 1,048 hives., “The number fluctuates but it is definitely something that will continue and that will require resources and advancements in the use of technology to help prevent and deter theft.”, The center of beehive thefts is California’s Central Valley, a fertile stretch of agricultural land responsible for about a quarter of all the produce grown in the US. This huge output – of lettuce, grapes, lemons, apricots and more – requires pollination from far more bees than naturally live in the area., The main driver of the demand for honeybees is the almond industry, which has doubled in size over the past two decades. There are currently 1.17m acres of almonds in California that require pollination which, at a standard rate of two beehives an acre, means the industry somehow needs to conjure up 2.34m beehives for a short window of time each February, when almond trees start to blossom., Beekeepers from across the US congregate in the Central Valley in a sort of annual almond jamboree; more than two-thirds of the nation’s commercially managed honeybees sent on trucks to a 50-mile-wide strip of fertile land. Unlike native, wild bees like bumblebees, honeybees are carefully marshaled in hives and are now more valuable as contract pollination workers than as honey producers., But the almond industry’s growth is heightening the demand for more bees at a time when even maintaining current numbers is a struggle. Due to the ravages of deadly mites, diseases and toxic pesticides, beekeepers now typically lose 40% of their colonies each winter, only making these numbers up through splitting hives and using various treatments and supplements to boost reproduction rates., This dynamic – growing demand for pollinators at a time when supply is under pressure – has seen the typical cost of a hive for pollination shoot up, from just $35 a few years ago to $200, and upwards, now. Pollination has become big business, causing some desperate beekeepers, or organized gangs, to be drawn to beehive crime., “Normal people can’t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck,” said Charley Nye, a beekeeper researcher at University of California, Davis. “So it’s a pretty small pool of people that are able to steal them. But the reward is so big that I think it can be tempting to people to do that.”, Lloyd Cunniff, who has been involved in beekeeping since he was 13 years old, never intended to bring his bees to the Central Valley, where endless rows of almond trees stretch out across the landscape in almost every direction., But Cunniff, now 59, had seen his third-generation apiary in Montana decimated by colony collapse disorder – a mysterious syndrome where the worker bees vacate a hive en masse – and needed the income. In January 2017, he loaded 488 beehives, each handmade in distinctive pine and cedar, and headed west., Through a trusted intermediary, Cunniff set his hives down to rest in a remote area near a levee. As is typical in the beekeeping world, there were no fences or other security systems to protect them. The next day, amid heavy fog, Cunniff went back to find them., “We had a GPS reading and we drove out there and my hired man said: ‘There’s your turn.’ And I turned in there and I said: ‘This can’t be the right turn.’ And he said: ‘Why?’ I said: ‘Because there’s no bees sitting,’” Cunniff recalled. “And I thought, ‘Uh-oh.’”, All 488 boxes had gone, quickly and skillfully loaded on to a truck and spirited away, costing Cunniff not just the $100,000 in pollination fees but also the basis of his livelihood. He wasn’t to know, but he was just one of many victims of a well-orchestrated operation., Not long after the theft, police were called to a scruffy field near Fresno where they saw something akin to bee carnage. Beehives were scattered randomly across the land, some open with their innards torn out, others scratched and daubed in paint. An irate swarm of bees made officers wary of exiting their cars., It was like a chop shop for bees ... And there were a lot of aggressive bees, “It was like a chop shop for bees,” said Andres Solis, a Fresno detective who specializes in agricultural crime. “None of the boxes matched, it was really untidy. And there were a lot of aggressive bees.”, Police called in beekeepers who estimated there were 2,500 hives belonging to a variety of legal owners. A nearby man, Pavel Tveretinov, was arrested under suspicion that he was hacking up the hives in order to multiply them and sell them on to needy growers., An alleged accomplice, Vitaliy Yeroshenko, was also arrested and both now face trial. “Victims started coming out of the woodwork after we started putting it out there,” Solis said. “We looked at what we saw and thought none of these beehives belonged to these gentlemen.”, The overall number of thefts dropped following the arrests but beekeepers are concerned that the ballooning demand for honeybees is only going to spur further criminal enterprises. The fallout from the ecological crisis in the bee, and wider insect, world is likely to include more and more bee rustlers., “There’s a shortage of bees this year, again,” Cunniff said. “You watch in this next week or two, there’s going to be stealing of bees like crazy down here., “It was just my turn. That’s how I look at it because it happens to somebody every year down here. They’re stealing them all the time. It’s just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.”bees hives theft stealing organized crime threat", "label": 0}, "train-341": {"text": "\nBees may struggle in winds caused by global warming, study finds\n, Experiment revealed increased wind speeds reduced the efficiency of their foraging , \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nTue 18 Feb 2020 03.37 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2020 14.45 EST\n\n, A hardworking honey bee might feel aggrieved to be tricked into a garden shed to feed from a fake flower. Worse, she is blasted by a cheap household fan. And then timed to see how many fake flowers she can visit in 90 seconds., But the honey bees’ tormentors are trying to help them: their ordeal is a controlled experiment that reveals how high wind speeds significantly reduce the efficiency of their foraging., The study by University of Sussex researchers raises fears that bees and other flying pollinators may struggle in the higher and more frequent winds caused by global heating., The bees, which usually feed on wild flowers after leaving their hives in the campus gardens, were lured into the shed with sugar water feeders. Only one bee was allowed in at a time, and their visits to artificial flowers were videoed and timed under different fan speeds, which mimicked calm and windy days., With no wind, the bees on average took nectar from 5.45 flowers during their 90-second time trial. When wind speeds were increased, this fell to an average of 3.73 flowers. Over the course of a day, a bee’s capacity to supply its colony with food would be significantly curtailed., Researchers also examined the indirect impact of higher winds by moving the flowers., The findings reveal that, while flower movement did not appear to have an effect on the bees, the movement of air from the fans made them much more hesitant to take off from a flower, with time taken ranging from an initial 0.05 seconds to 54 seconds. , Georgia Hennessy, lead author of the research published in the journal Animal Behaviour, said that one possible reason for the wind causing hesitancy was that small increases in wind speed reduced the bees’ body temperature, so they require longer to warm up the flight muscles required to take off., Another reason could be that the honey bees were waiting for a pause in the wind to take off, with gusty conditions occurring frequently in nature. , “We would expect that if it was a particularly windy summer the honey bees could be affected by it,” said Hennessy., “With wind speeds predicted to increase in the years ahead, understanding how we can help pollinators in a changing climate is becoming ever more pressing. Although we can’t do much to control or stop the wind, we can take steps to minimise its impact on pollinators, such as placing hives in sheltered locations.”, The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization warned last year that the decline in global bee populations was a “threat to global food security and nutrition”., Dave Goulson, professor of biology at the University of Sussex, said: “Insect pollinators already face many pressures in the modern world, such as loss of habitat and exposure to pesticides, and a great many are in decline. Coping with increasingly blustery weather under climate change may be the final straw for some.”bees may struggle in winds caused by global warming study finds", "label": 0}, "train-342": {"text": "\nWhat four years at sea taught me about our relationship to the ocean\n, Oceans are central to the story of civilisation – so why do so many of us feel disconnected from them?, \nElle Hunt, \n\nTue 18 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2020 05.54 EST\n\n, It was on day 11, I think, that I stopped getting out of bed at all. I had already let my hygiene standards slip to the point that a large knot was starting to form in my hair. Later my mother would have to cut it out with scissors. She didn’t mind. We were all in the same boat., I was nine years old, and nearly two weeks into sailing across the Atlantic with my family. My father had sailed all his life, and introduced my mother to it; and they spent years preparing to sail around the world. Including my little sister, that made four of us aboard a 52ft yacht – our home for four years from 2000, in which time we got from Dorset to New Zealand., The longest period we spent entirely at sea was 21 days, and we did so twice: from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Barbados, and then from the Galápagos Islands to Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia. The first trip I remember spending mostly in bed, below deck in the dark, listening to Wings on cassette, forging a new relationship to time., I grew used to observing the ebb and flow of my thoughts with a languor that today would probably be praised as meditative. The days slid by, mostly unbroken except for meals – you came to really anticipate meals – and milestones: quarter-way, halfway, crossing the equator, which we marked with little parties., Not long after the sun had gone down, you’d go to sleep – partly because artificial light drained the boat’s battery, and partly because the sooner you went to sleep, the sooner another day would pass, and the sooner you would arrive. (I was lucky – being nine, I was spared night watch. My parents slept in alternating shifts of two hours for the whole journey.), When we finally reached Bridgetown in Barbados, and set foot on land for the first time in three weeks, my knees wobbled, bracing for the next wave that didn’t come., That transatlantic crossing is a well-trodden path, from 15th-century navigators from Italy and Spain to Greta Thunberg’s voyage to New York last year. All of history, in fact, can be charted from the world’s oceans, as David Abulafia attempts in The Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans, a 1,000-page doorstopper that he nonetheless makes no pretence is either “complete or comprehensive”., Connections made by sea “have brought together peoples, religions and civilisations” through conquest and colonisation, migration and trade, writes Abulafia, an emeritus professor of Mediterranean history at Cambridge – and in the process changed the world. Much of it has been driven simply by curiosity, and the desire to accumulate knowledge, he says., “Even if you go back to the time before Christopher Columbus, when the open Atlantic was very little known, the myths and assumptions that developed about it – the ‘sea of darkness’ and then, on the other hand, ‘the isles of the blessed’ – the fascination with what lies beyond the horizon was certainly an important part.”, I see elements of that in my father, whose 50-year passion for sailing goes well beyond what you might call a hobby. “He’s only happy at sea,” says Mum, who is happy at sea, but also in her garden, or at a concert hall, or with her children., My parents remain “liveaboards”, sailing international waters from New Zealand. For them, it is a lifestyle that they have opted into, a way to see the world from a relatively unique vantage point., Yet for most of history there has also been “a mercenary dimension” to ocean exploration, says Abulafia, “the wish to exploit”: “You know you’re taking risks, but these are risks that can bring you the most fantastic returns.” Maritime trade has been more productive and enduring than the Silk Road; in the 16th century, shipping spices from India proved so lucrative for Portugal that the Portuguese king made disclosing the route punishable by death., The movement of not just goods, but people has been another constant – whether their migration was forced, such as by invasion or the slave trade; or voluntary, in search of a new life and opportunities. Passages have been guided by the trade winds and currents that drive climate and weather all over the world. More than 70% of the globe is covered by ocean; it produces around half the oxygen we breathe, and absorbs half of all man-made carbon dioxide., At many levels, the story of civilisation is a story of the seas – but it is easy to overlook that from land. Most people, even those who live by the coast, have no more personal connection to the sea than the limited or conditional view afforded by a passion for water sports, say, or the odd trip to the seaside. A more intimate relationship can be incompatible with conventional ways of life and maybe – the knot in my hair might attest – its quality., At the same time it changes you, in what can feel like a very profound way. It was only relatively recently, I’m embarrassed to say, that I realised that my experience was not universally shared – that not everyone had known the open ocean, with no land in sight in any direction for many miles. No other boats, either – just endless sea, sometimes even indistinguishable from sky; an expanse of grey or blue, entirely uninterrupted, except by you., It is hard to convey what that feels like, the effect that it can have. You feel dwarfed and insignificant, of course – but the mind cannot hold on to reverence for long. I remember it more often playing tricks on me, registering patterns and shapes in the movements of the wave – my brain determinedly generating interest, overlaying meaning, as though it could not make sense of there being only water everywhere., Even as a child, though, there was something about being at sea that made me feel well: more vital, clear-headed. In fact the benefits of “blue space”, for body and mind, have been established by decades of research, from environmental factors such as more vitamin D and less polluted air and the increased activity that tends to go with being in nature., More significant is the psychologically restorative effect, where the movement of water – its literal immersiveness – can force attention outwards, beyond the self. But these effects on mood tend to be most acute at coastal margins, where the sea meets the land. “The optimal environment has both,” says Dr Mathew White, an environmental psychologist with BlueHealth. “If you’ve ever been on a cruise, or crossed to France, it’s pretty boring out there when you can’t see the coast.”, As a crew member on the inaugural voyage from New York to Macau in 1784 grumbled of their smooth passage: “It has been one dreary waste of sky &amp; water, without a pleasing sight to cheer us.” Abulafia paraphrased: “One went to sea for excitement, and all that happened was that the captain fell against a railing and bruised his head and arm.” He suspects that some ships’ diarists exaggerated the risk of storms and shipwreck so as to enliven accounts “of a flat sea and neutral sky for days and days”., Yet, in imagining a life at sea, most people seem less inclined to think of tedium than terror. Many have told me that the thought of being stranded in the open ocean is one of their greatest fears; I’m not sure that they would single out being lost in a forest, for example, or on a snowy mountain in the same way, though all three landscapes are alien and potentially dangerous., In fact the first question I am most often asked about my childhood is “Were there any storms?” or, more to the point: “Were you scared?” The answers are yes, only one, a freak occurrence overnight; and no – I slept through it. My parents were highly risk-averse, setting out for sea only when the weather forecast was favourable and they had supplies – food, medical, electrical – to account for every possible eventuality., The exhaustive (and expensive) logistics tend to be glossed over in the other image people have of being at sea – the romantic one, of chucking it all in and sailing off into the sunset. Whether or not this idea appeals to you was found by data scientists at the dating app OkCupid to be one of the strongest predictors of romantic compatibility; I know enough to answer no., Both scenarios, the worst-case and the rose-tinted, are telling of the disconnect most people feel from the ocean. A sense of trepidation has figured in seafaring through history, except among those whose knowledge and mastery of the ocean was evolved over several millennia to seem almost innate – the early Polynesian navigators of the Pacific, the ancestors of the New Zealand Māori and Hawaiians., There could be a genetic predisposition towards how we feel about travelling the seas: DRD 4-7R, the so-called “wanderlust” gene, is thought to be present in about 20% of the population. In his book On the Ocean, the archaeologist Sir Barry Cunliffe pointed to scientific findings that this impulse to travel, “to satisfy an innate curiosity”, could be one explanation for why “the unknown engages the human imagination, and draws the curious out of the familiar place they inhabit into the threatening, but ever exciting space beyond”., Even if my parents have wanderlust in their DNA, I’m not sure it was handed down to me. Though I spent the first half of my life sailing, I acquired none of the skills – I couldn’t even manage a bowline knot. I have blamed it on my being a child, but the truth is I have never had any interest in boats beyond as a means of accessing the open ocean., I still feel a strong connection to the sea – but it has been challenging to maintain in my adult life, from the tower block in south London where I now live. When I am struggling to get to sleep I play ocean sounds through my phone, a crude attempt to simulate the limitlessness, even transcendence, I remember feeling out in open water., The ocean presents a potential passage through history, like handling an ancient piece of pottery; only more so, because it “is alive, like a person”, to paraphrase an Indigenous Australian saying. You can be claimed by the sea without drowning. I feel its absence on a bodily level like a mineral deficiency, and make regular visits to the coast to “top up”, as the geographer Catherine Kelly evocatively put it. Now, although long-distance passenger travel by sea has become almost unheard of, Thunberg’s voyage across the Atlantic, and the growing “no-fly” movement to cut down on carbon emissions, could suggest turning tides., The oceans face considerable challenges themselves, from plastic pollution and deep-sea oil drilling, to unsustainable shipping and fishing. The rising acidity of the Pacific Ocean is causing crabs’ shells to dissolve. Warming temperatures have already opened up new trade routes over the top of Russia and Canada. We face the beginning of a new chapter in the history of oceans – for us along with them., Abulafia notes that rising sea levels have been suggested as a precipitating factor in past migration, forcing people to go in search of new land. A study last year predicted that warming temperatures will raise sea levels by 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the contribution from melting ice and glaciers., These are uncharted waters that humanity is navigating – but not, there is some comfort in acknowledging, for the first time.what four years at sea taught me about our relationship to the ocean", "label": 0}, "train-343": {"text": "\nCountry diary: orchestral manoeuvres in the dusk\n, Stoney Middleton, Derbyshire: A murmuration of starlings is captivating and hard to describe. Perhaps we should think of it as art involving movement and music, \nMark Cocker, \n\nTue 18 Feb 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, All starling roosts are wonderful but some are more wonderful than others – a matter determined by numbers, their location, the prevailing light and wind, and one’s capacity to get close to the birds. Yet it was slow to build, and at 4.47pm I was beginning to wonder if it would happen at all. Then there was suddenly an evolving genie of birds., Soon there were multiple genies, and as these formations revolved there were convulsive downward movements as hundreds entered the roost and vanished. Yet if thousands disappeared, thousands arrived, and the sky became a self-filling vessel., It is difficult to define precisely why murmurations are so captivating, but perhaps it’s this. As they passed, the gyrations suggested to me the following: a flock of knots, a shoal of minnows, an army-ant colony in hunting spate across the rainforest floor, an octopus, an anaconda wound in round coil, a broad river’s flow but also its arching bridge, an ocean tide, a silk scarf in a breeze; they were autumn leaves torn down by a strong wind, black fireworks, a black rainbow and a single amoeba in phagocytosis., These were not in sequence; they were all manifest simultaneously. I could perhaps describe it best if I could take all the letters from all those words and make a single construction that conjured all parts at once. Yet for every observer that imaginary word would have to be unique, because for each of us starlings summon different things., Bear in mind also that a roost is not an inherited entity shaped by genes. It is a cultural phenomenon, passed on, one to another. Perhaps we should think of it as art involving movement and music, since one has both the geophony of the wind through trees, and the biophony of their voices and wings. The closest might be a ballet with orchestra, but recall that there is no rehearsal and it is entirely functional. Perhaps it’s more than any human art. It is starling art: made in soil of earthworms and leatherjacket mash, conceived in the moment, delivered in real time and unique each evening.country diary orchestral manoeuvres in the dusk", "label": 0}, "train-344": {"text": "\nWorld leaders urged to 'step back from precipice' of ecological ruin\n, As governments prepare to negotiate a Paris-style UN agreement on nature, 23 former foreign ministers have issued a call for urgent action, \nPatrick Greenfield, \n\nTue 18 Feb 2020 00.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 18 Feb 2020 06.23 EST\n\n, Humanity’s ongoing destruction of nature threatens the survival of our species, a group of former foreign ministers has warned, calling on leaders to step back from “the precipice” of irreversible ecological ruin and protect the planet., The planet’s rapidly warming oceans must be the focus of increased conservation efforts due to their importance in producing oxygen and food for billions of people, the former ministers added, as governments prepare to begin negotiations for a Paris-style UN agreement on nature next week., In a statement signed by 23 diplomats – including former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind – world leaders are urged to back the draft UN agreement to protect almost a third of the world’s oceans and land., In October this year, hundreds of biodiversity experts and government ministers are expected to descend on the Chinese city of Kunming, Yunnan, to adopt the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. The accord has been touted as the \"Paris agreement\" for nature, aiming to stop and reverse rampant biodiversity loss around the world., Why is it a big deal?In 2017, scientists warned that humans are causing the sixth mass extinction in the Earth's history. Overpopulation and overconsumption are driving a crisis that threatens the future of our species and life-sustaining ecosystems. , Are only governments worried? No. At the 2020 World Economic Forum, business leaders warned biodiversity loss was the third biggest risk to the world in terms of likelihood and severity, ahead of infectious diseases, terror attacks and interstate conflict.  , What might the Kunming agreement look like? In January, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity published a 20-point draft of the agreement. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, introduce controls on invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. Critics, however, say this does not go nearly far enough. , Is this agreement part of a long term plan?Yes. The UN has an overarching plan that humanity should be living in harmony with nature by 2050. The 2030 goals relate to that ambition in five ways: ensure no net losses in the integrity and size of freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems by the end of this decade; reduce the number of species threatened with extinction; enhance genetic diversity; achieve targets of the Paris Agreement, and share the benefits of genetic resources and traditional knowledge. , Next week’s meeting in Rome – originally scheduled to take place in Kunming, China but moved to the Italian capital in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak – will be the first time governments formally react to the 20-point proposals to halt and reverse biodiversity loss., The current draft commits countries to protect 30% of the planet, introduce controls on invasive species, and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%., “The loss and degradation of nature jeopardises human health, livelihoods, safety and prosperity. It disproportionately harms our poorest communities while undermining our ability to meet a broad range of targets set by the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. We must rise above politics and ideology to unite the global community around the urgent cause of protecting our planet and way of life,” reads the statement, which was released through non-profit thinktank Aspen Institute., The former ministers highlighted the climate crisis, the “excessive exploitation” of natural resources, and ecosystem degradation as grave threats to international security, warning they “imperil the future for our grandchildren”., “Humanity sits on the precipice of irreversible loss of biodiversity and a climate crisis that imperils the future for our grandchildren and generations to come. The world must act boldly, and it must act now,” the statement continues., The comments follow those by indigenous groups, scientists and business leaders ahead of the meeting in Rome., “The marine environment deserves special attention, as it covers 70% of our planet, and even people who live far inland depend on the ocean to produce half of the oxygen we breathe, to serve as the primary source of protein for over 3 billion people, and to help maintain a liveable climate,” the statement continues., “In addition to protecting 30% of the ocean, we also call on nations of the world to manage the entirety of their ocean territories in a manner that is sustainable, equitable, and integrated across sectors. This combination of protection and sustainable management will ensure the health and productivity of the global ocean on which we all depend.”, Last month, the UN’s new biodiversity chief warned humanity will have “given up” on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems., When asked what not taking action would mean, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, told the Guardian: “The risks will be major. One is that we will not have listened to the science and the evidence provided. Because we will not have listened, it means the global community will have said: let biodiversity loss continue, let people continue to die, let the degradation continue, deforestation continue, pollution continue, and we’ll have given up as an international community to save the planet., “I hope that’s not where any of us would want to be.”, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresworld leaders urged to step back from precipice of ecological ruin aoe", "label": 0}, "train-345": {"text": "Government to take ‘technology over taxation’ approach to climate change, Morrison would not confirm reports of technology investment target but said emissions reductions are not achieved through ‘meetings’, Scott Morrison has described a report he may adopt a technology investment target to avoid signing up to a commitment of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as speculation, but confirmed his government will take a “technology over taxation” approach to climate change., On Tuesday, Morrison told reporters in Melbourne the report in the Australian was “very speculative”, but said it was true that emissions reductions were achieved through technology, not “meetings”., The Australian suggested Morrison favoured a technology investment target as a way to help Australia resist an international push for a more explicit commitment to reduce emissions to net zero by mid-century at the next major UN climate summit in Glasgow in November., The government is expected to soon release what it calls a technology investment roadmap, but has said little about what it will entail., Several moderate Liberal MPs including Katie Allen and Trent Zimmerman have noted Australia effectively committed to net zero emissions by signing the 2015 Paris agreement. Under that deal, countries agreed to keep global heating above pre-industrial levels below 2C and to pursue policies to restrict it to 1.5C., Morrison has begun the political year torn between moderate Liberals attempting to build traction internally for the government to increase climate action and resistance from the Nationals, who want more government support for coal-fired power., Cabinet discussions have explored how to reposition the government’s climate policies, with a focus on technology, as the bushfire crisis caused a spike in concern about the environment and a hit to Morrison’s popularity., At a press conference on Tuesday, Morrison reiterated that Australia would not make commitments without “having thoroughly looked at what is the impact on jobs”., Asked if an investment target would create tension with those who want a net zero emissions commitment, Morrison said “currently no one can tell me that going down that path won’t cost jobs, won’t put up your electricity prices, and won’t impact negatively on jobs in the economies of rural and regional Australia”., A major report by CSIRO last year found there was no trade-off between strong economic growth and transitioning to zero emissions. The result of two years’ work by 50 leaders across the community, the CSIRO’s Australian National Outlook report found bold action to combat rising challenges could lead to GDP growth of 2.76% to 2.8% annually, a 90% increase in real wages and net zero emissions by 2050., On Tuesday, Morrison suggested investment in technology would enable steel plants to use hydrogen power and increase uptake of renewable energy., “The smart way in dealing with this to get emissions down … is to focus on the technology and making sure that that technology is affordable and it is scalable,” he said., “You want to get global emissions down? … You need technology that can be accessed and put in place, not just here in Australia, but all around the world. Meetings won’t achieve that, technology does. And I can tell you taxes won’t achieve it either.”, The industry minister, Karen Andrews, told reporters at Flinders University she was focused on “what the solutions will be rather than endlessly discussing targets or whether or not climate change is real”., Andrews said it was “clear that we do have businesses … that are already investing”, citing BAE and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre., Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said a technology target would be a throwback to 2007, when then prime minister John Howard and US president George W. Bush rejected emissions reduction targets agreed under the Kyoto Protocol in favour of a “technology approach” that including support for nuclear power and “clean coal”., “Of course technology is the key to lowering emissions, but industry has made it clear that the take-up of new technology requires a serious energy and climate policy,” Butler said. “This is something the Morrison government will never deliver as long as the hard-right climate deniers continue to run the show on climate policy.”, The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said: “Instead of a technology smokescreen, we need a Green New Deal to work with affected communities and workers to phase out coal, create new industries and look after the workers in those communities who are affected”., Erwin Jackson, policy director with the Investor Group on Climate Change, said acting on technology was important but not enough. He said all policy needed to be tied to an emissions goal. Net zero emissions was the most credible long-term scenario and had widespread backing, including within the business community., “Setting a path to net zero emissions is prudent economic risk management,” Jackson said. “The only question is if it’s going to happen in a smooth way or in a disruptive way.”, Martijn Wilder, a partner at climate advisory and investment firm Pollination and chairman of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), said technology would play a critical role in reaching net zero emissions if backed by strong policies., “With the right mix of technologies and policies, Australia is easily capable of reaching net zero well before 2050 and in doing so building an incredibly strong decarbonised economy,” he said., Wilder said having strong public institutions, such as Arena and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and policies similar to Britain’s promised ban on new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars by 2035 could “greatly accelerate the transition”., In addition to the technology investment roadmap, the government has commissioned a review of its climate policies led by the businessman Grant King, and promised an electric vehicle policy and a long-term emissions strategy. It has also made it known it is likely to give an $11m grant to the owners of the Vales Point coal-fired power plant in the May budget.government to take technology over taxation approach to climate change", "label": 0}, "train-346": {"text": "\nWest Midlands canals to help heat hospitals in renewable energy drive\n, Government pledges to spend £20m turning canals, mines and rail lines into heat sources, \nJillian Ambrose Energy correspondent, \n\nMon 17 Feb 2020 19.18 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 17 Feb 2020 14.06 EST\n\n, The canals of the West Midlands may seem an unlikely source of warmth, but these waterways could soon be used to heat hospitals and tower blocks under a plan to harness Britain’s hidden heating sources., The government has promised to spend more than £20m on nine schemes across the country to exploit cheap, renewable heat from canals, old mineshafts and in London tube lines., It will spend another £70m to build some of Europe’s first plants to generate green hydrogen gas for homes and factories, including a project in Grimsby that will use the clean electricity generated by offshore wind turbines to make the low-carbon alternative gas from water., Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for business, energy and clean growth, said cleaning up emissions from industry and housing was a big challenge, and an important part of “eliminating our contribution to climate change by 2050 while also growing our economy”., The government’s hunt for alternative renewable sources of heat has gained pace after ministers pledged to ban gas-fired boilers from newbuild homes from 2025. Officials estimate that the latest funding could provide a local renewable energy resource to 250,000 people by 2030, which would cut their energy bills by half while helping the UK to meet its climate targets., Birmingham’s canals have been picked to play a role in the UK’s green heating revolution by GreenSCIES, which is also working on a proposal that uses  “waste heat”from the London underground to warm hundreds of homes in Islington, north London., The consortium, led by London South Bank University, plans to use the government funding to grow the GreenSCIES project and install water source heat pumps in the canal, which runs through Sandwell near Birmingham., The heat pumps work like a refrigerator in reverse, using a coolant gas to transfer heat from the water to be piped into a council tower block of 1,200 residents, many of whom are fuel poor. An extension of the project could be used to warm Birmingham City hospital., Heat pumps will also be used at another government-backed project in Rugeley, north of Birmingham, where a defunct coal-fired power plant is to be turned into a sustainable village of 2,300 homes, warmed by local canals and geothermal heat from disused mineshaft., Once at full scale, the Islington project will provide heat to an estimated 33,000 residents and nearly 70 local businesses. It will also help to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 80% compared with traditional gas-fuelled heating systems while also addressing fuel poverty., Government officials also plan to throw their support behind two schemes, on the banks of the Mersey and near Aberdeen, to produce low-carbon hydrogen by splitting traditional heating gas and capturing the carbon dioxide that is released before it can contribute to global heating., Hydrogen was injected directly into a UK gas network for the first time  this year. A 20% blend of hydrogen in the national gas grid could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 6m tonnes a year – the equivalent of taking 2.5m cars off the road., • This article was amended on 19 February 2020. An earlier version said that hydrogen had been injected directly into the UK gas grid, when it was actually into a private gas network.

The Australian capital had endured days of poisonous air quality. Thick smoke from fires burning in New South Wales and Victoria had rendered the city’s landmarks invisible., On New Year’s Day in Canberra the air quality reading was the worst on the planet: 26 times levels considered hazardous to human health., Janagaraja, a psychology student at the Australian National University, has rheumatoid arthritis. “I think for even ordinary people it makes it really hard to breathe,” she says. “But for me, when the air pollution increases, my levels of inflammation, my joint pain, increases massively. It gets worse every time I take a deep breath.”, By the time she asked a friend for help she had spent two days indoors, skipping meals, barely able to breathe, such was the effect of the smoke on the already inflamed joints around her rib cage., “It’s been quite a huge loss of bodily autonomy because I’m not someone that’s very good at asking for help.”, Australia is known for its clean air. But this summer’s unprecedented fire season is changing that.

She says rising temperatures from climate change can increase air pollutants, such as ground level ozone. , As Australia experiences more frequent bushfires and dust storms because of climate change, we will also see an increase in air pollution, sometimes far from its original source. “We’re seeing it already and we’re going to see more of it in future,” Green says., The most common air pollutants that are dangerous to human health are coarse and fine particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide., Since August 2019, the air quality in Australian towns and cities has repeatedly exceeded hazardous levels, These charts show the maximum daily air quality index (AQI) reading for four locations.

About two-thirds of the fish were catfish and the rest were tilapia. The team say telltale marks on the bones reveal the fish were eaten by humans who used the shelter., It is not the first time fish remains have been found in what are now dry regions of the desert, but the team say it is the first time the ancient climate of the region has been traced through animal remains., “All the other finds are surface finds, from just one layer, one period, one event. Whereas what we have here is a 5,000-year sequence with a lot of bones – so that makes it special,” said Dr Wim van Neer from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, a co-author of the study., The discovery is the latest in a string of finds from the large Takarkori rock shelter, a site, about 50-60 metres long and 30 metres high, that is thought to have been first used by hunter gatherers more than 10,000 years ago., Prof Savino di Lernia, a co-author of the study from Sapienza University of Rome, said previous finds at the shelter included evidence of rock art, the earliest signs in Africa of wild cereals being cultivated and their seeds stored, and evidence from pottery shards of dairy practices in Africa dating back nearly 7,000 years ago., Naturally mummified human remains of Neolithic pastoralists have also been discovered at the shelter, while the uppermost layers of the site are composed of dung left by the animals of nomadic herders that later camped at the site between 5,900 and 4,650 years ago., Writing in the journal Plos One, Van Neer and colleagues report that fish account for about 80% of the animal remains discovered at the site during the 5,000-year period it was used by humans, with mammals making up just over 19%. Birds molluscs and other animals such as turtles account for the rest., The team found the predominance of fish was not steady but fell from about 90% in the earliest layers to about 48% in those from the most recent period of its occupation., “The amount of fish is decreasing through time and the contribution of mammals increases, showing that people at Takarkori focussed gradually more on hunting and livestock keeping,” the authors write. But, they add: “It is unclear if this was an intentional process or if this shift could be related to increasing aridity, which made the environment less favourable for fishes.”, The findings chime with previous evidence from the Sahara, including from sediments and geological features, that have highlighted a shift in the climate from a wetter environment with vegetation and abundant lakes more than 10,000 years ago, to a period of fluctuating dry and wet conditions, until about 5,500 years ago the region became increasingly arid, resulting in the landscape seen today.,  “As it became drier it is possible there was more distance that had to be covered to exploit these fish, and that is why we have a decrease,” said Van Neer. “People are opportunistic – if it is easy to get they take it.”, Dr Clayton Magill of Heriot-Watt University, who was not part of the research team but previously explored climate change in the African savannah, said the shift to desert conditions in the Sahara region was one of the most remarkable ecological transitions in the Earth’s recent past. , The new study, he said, showed that such large-scale climate change could affect species differently and increased our understanding of our human ancestors and their relationship with the climate. “The study links climate change with changes in culture, whether related to subsistence strategies or social behaviour, thus marking a shift towards coupled human and natural landscapes in which humans are affected by and, in turn, affect their environments,” he said.ancient fish meals chart sahara climate shift savannah desert", "label": 0}, "train-349": {"text": "\nOne in 10 new homes in England built on land with high flood risk\n, Number of properties built in high-risk areas has more than doubled in recent years, \nJosh Halliday North of England correspondent, \n\nWed 19 Feb 2020 13.24 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2020 20.55 EST\n\n, One in 10 of all new homes in England since 2013 have been built on land at the highest risk of flooding, official figures reveal, potentially leaving tens of thousands of people in greater danger from extreme winter storms., The number of properties built in these high-risk areas annually has more than doubled in recent years, with more than 84,000 new at-risk homes in total since 2013, according to a Guardian analysis of government data., In the aftermath of the devastating Storms Ciara and Dennis, experts and council leaders have warned that residents are being left at risk in part due to the pressure on local authorities to build thousands of new homes despite a dearth of suitable sites., Prof Robert Wilby, of the University of Loughborough, said the government should review its housebuilding target in light of the increasing risk from floods: “We’re compounding the existing risk by continuing to build on the floodplain. The more we’re paving over natural areas the more we’re making it easier for water to move across the land and enter rivers.”, The figures emerged on Wednesday, with householders across large parts of the country braced for further bad weather, with another month’s worth of rain expected in the next 24 hours in some places., Those already battling the aftermath of several days worth of rain have been told to expect even more, with pockets of North Wales, northern England and Scotland among those in line for further deluges., Thousands of people have already been affected by the most damaging winter storms in recent times, with the worst hit areas in South Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire, where major incidents have been declared., With many people forced to evacuate their homes, experts warned that targets given to local authorities for new builds often fail to take into account local flood risk., The government has promised to build 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s to help solve the UK’s chronic housing shortage. Data from the ministry of housing, communities and local government (MHCLG) shows that the number of new houses built on land at the highest risk of flooding has risen from 9,500 in 2013 to 20,000 in 2017-18, following a peak of nearly 24,000 the previous year., In Calderdale, the West Yorkshire valley that has been hit by four floods in the past eight years, one in five new homes have been built on land with a high risk of flooding since 2015. The data relates to houses built in what the Environment Agency calls “flood zone 3”, the highest level of risk where the likelihood of flooding is 1% or higher each year., Tim Swift, the leader of Calderdale council, said local authorities had been left in an “impossible position” due to the housebuilding targets imposed on them by central government and the pressure to alleviate the flood risk., “Councils are stuck between the government demands for housebuilding and the difficulties for identifying suitable sites,” he said. “There’s got to be a look at planning policy and the relationship between housing numbers and the pressures on flooding.”, Wilby said the issue was one of several that needed to be examined by the government in light of storms Ciara and Dennis. He said ministers also needed to rethink contingency planning for widespread disasters like these – with multiple agencies with often overlapping roles on the ground – and ensure the regular maintenance of flood defences and drainage systems., Another key issue is funding. Boris Johnson has committed to spending £4bn over the next five years on flood defence schemes. However, the Environment Agency and independent experts have said this is too little and that money needs to be committed way beyond 2025 so planners can mitigate future disasters., “A greater level of investment would mean that we could prepare better for floods,” said Prof Hannah Cloke, of the University of Reading, who is helping the Environment Agency respond to the widespread damage caused by storms Ciara and Dennis., She said that with more funding “people would not be at such great risk” and planners could make bold changes to cities and landscapes that at the moment “we just can’t do”. She added: “You can’t plan ahead to deal with climate change unless you have a sustainable funding source to take those big measures, to redesign cities and landscapes so we can design better for floods.”, Ministers have also been advised to place more emphasis on natural flood management, such as planting trees, building so-called “leaky dams” and capturing water upstream, as well as building more hard structures like flood barriers., An MHCLG spokeswoman said: “Local authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need and our planning policy is clear that housing should be located in the areas at least risk of flooding.”, She added that when development in a risk area was “absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding”., However, in Calderdale, Swift said while there were measures to ensure new homes were flood-resilient, in practice this relied on good building control and regulations and that it was “not always possible to achieve that”.one in ten new homes in england built on land with high flood risk", "label": 0}, "train-350": {"text": "\nGetting a proper grip on flooding problems\n, Letters, \n\nWed 19 Feb 2020 13.08 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2020 13.12 EST\n\n, There is a link between the Trinity College protest (Cambridge college lawn dug up by XR protesters, 18 February) and the flooding on which you also report. The Trinity protest was aimed at the plan to dig up farmland in Kirton, Suffolk, to build a mammoth lorry park, which would ruin three villages. This particular proposal has now been rejected., You also report on the need for better natural drains to protect against floods (Better natural drains needed as storms get more intense, warn scientists, 18 February). However, the main natural drain in Suffolk is precisely the farmland and marshland that Trinity is infamous for building on (the plan for a lorry park has now been replaced with plans for a de facto new town). Digging up green belt land and farmland is a flood risk. The water that used to be stored in the ground has to go somewhere. Suffolk was spared this time round, but last year had floods in areas adjacent to new-builds that had never flooded before. Other counties may not have been so lucky – there was building uphill just outside Tenbury Wells., Flooding isn’t only about climate change. Concreting the countryside in the present reckless manner increases flood risks, and the consequences of those risks are seldom borne by the people doing the building, or by Trinity College.Dr Jon MulbergFelixstowe, Suffolk, • The environment secretary, George Eustice, insists the government has a “firm grip” on the issue of flooding (PM accused of hindering recovery from floods, 19 February). Let’s not confuse a “firm grip” with a proper grip. It is entirely understandable that devastated local communities want local flood defences. But if the events of the last fortnight are to become “the new normal”, we need leadership at the highest level to deliver a fully thought-through, integrated response to flooding at the large river catchment scale. The sticking-plaster solution of building more, and ever higher, flood defences (with the intergenerational commitment that this implies) runs the risk of efficiently channeling flood flows to weak points downstream and disconnecting rivers from their floodplains. It may be shocking to see vast expanses of muddy water from the air, but this is what rivers do – and must be allowed to do.Prof Tom SpencerDepartment of geography, University of Cambridge, • As scientists who have been studying the impact of burning on ecosystems in the British uplands, we would like to raise several issues in George Monbiot’s article (One way to cut flooding is to stop burning the moorland, 12 February)., “The burning of peatlands, research suggests, is likely to exacerbate floods downstream,” he writes. This research is a single paper that forms part of the EMBER project – research that has been found to be flawed and unreliable. The study was not a randomised controlled trial – burnt and unburnt rivers were both located within different areas of moorland sites that were studied in the project. Consequently, we cannot be sure if the results presented are linked to burning or rather due to the environmental differences between the various sites. Furthermore, the study artificially increased the treatment-level sample size of streamflow measurements by 2,400%. This is known as pseudoreplication – a process that greatly increases the chance of finding a statistically significant effect and severely limits the generalisation of findings., Finally, Mr Monbiot cites a paper investigating the impact that the restoration of bare peat has on the downstream flood control potential of blanket bog. However, this was conducted on a severely degraded area of bare peat and is, therefore, not a valid comparison to grouse moors. Thus, apart from the findings of a single flawed report, there is currently no clear link between burning on blanket bog and flooding downstream. More robust research is needed to guide land management and policy with respect to the effects of rotational burning on our uplands.Dr Mark AshbyResearcher, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster UniversityDr Andreas HeinemeyerSenior research fellow, Stockholm Environment Institute, University of York, • George Monbiot berates land managers and government over recent floods, blaming them on what he sees as poor practice. The reality is that thousands of hectares of peatland have been restored on moorland across the UK, with many more such projects planned and all aiding the natural flood management he advocates. Moor owners and managers are evolving their practices so that they can play a full part in climate regulation, natural flood management and biodiversity. The whole of society is adjusting to the changes needed to deal with the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis, and results will not be seen overnight. However, rather than criticise, the Heather Trust takes a different approach. We work across sectors and interests to support the development of moorland management practices to ensure they deliver for these new and important agendas. Building consensus and common purpose does not grab headlines, but it does lead to lasting change.Anne GrayDirector, The Heather Trust, • I was very disappointed at the opinion expressed by George Monbiot in describing the vital role and work of our internal drainage boards (IDBs), who manage water when it reaches the lowest parts of our catchments., IDBs very much support better upper-catchment management and natural flood management measures to reduce run-off to lower parts of the catchment which they help manage. That management focuses on the correct balance of the needs of the environment, local economy and people, with added emphasis on reducing flood risk and carefully providing water to agricultural areas in times of its scarcity., Mr Monbiot claims that IDBs don’t appear to be answerable to any government department. IDBs are defined as a risk management authority under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, and operate to governance rules set out in the Land Drainage Act (1991). Effectively acting as small local authorities, they are accountable bodies which undertake their flood risk management functions in line with England’s national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy, and are scrutinised by local authority committees, as well as reporting annually to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs., Yes, the predecessors of IDBs were originally formed by groups of landowners interested in managing water for their interests and benefit as far back as the 13th century, but today IDBs are highly efficient and democratic, operating for the wider public benefit of an area set out in legislation. Indeed, as a result of the work they carry out and their environmental stewardship of our water corridors, people are demanding that IDBs be allowed to increase their area of activities where other authorities are unable to justify looking after our rivers. Lower down the catchment, where there is the complex interface between people and economic activity, infrastructure, etc, our rivers and waterways need careful management using a variety of tools; IDBs are very well placed, skilled and equipped to do that.Innes ThomsonChief executive, Association of Drainage Authorities, • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com, • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters, • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

There were also doubts about what share of fossil methane was naturally released and what share was from industry., Earlier estimates were based on intermittent, bottom-up monitoring of oil and gas companies and comparisons with geological evidence from the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,600 years ago., For a more accurate comparison, a team at the University of Rochester in the US examined levels of methane in the pre-industrial era about 300 years ago. This was achieved by analysing air from that period trapped in glaciers in Greenland. The sample – made up of about a tonne of ice – was extracted with a Blue Ice Drill, capable of producing the world’s biggest ice cores., The findings, published in Nature, suggest the share of naturally released fossil methane has been overestimated by “an order of magnitude”, which means that human activities are 25-40% more responsible for fossil methane in the atmosphere than thought., This strengthens suspicions that fossil fuel companies are not fully accounting for their impact on the climate, particularly with regard to methane – a colourless, odourless gas that many plants routinely vent into the atmosphere., An earlier study revealed methane emissions from US oil and gas plants were 60% higher than reported to the Environmental Protection Agency., Accidents are also underreported. A single blowout at a natural gas well in Ohio in 2018 discharged more methane over three weeks than the oil and gas industries of France, Norway and the Netherlands released in an entire year. At the time, the company said it was unsure of the size of the leak. The immense scale was only revealed a year later when scientists analysed satellite data provided by the European Space Agency., Fracking also appears to have worsened the problem. Atmospheric methane had started to flatten off at the turn of the century, but rose again after a surge in fracking activity in the US and elsewhere. The industry, however, continues to claim that the energy source can be used as a “bridge fuel” because it has lower carbon emissions than oil or coal, but this fails to account for leaks and flares of methane and other gases during extraction., For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC., The UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions., The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations., Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority., Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent, Growing calls for tighter controls will be strengthened by the new study. The lead author, Benjamin Hmiel, said the paper was cause for optimism because it showed that action on methane – which has a relatively short shelf life, persisting in the atmosphere for about nine years – could give a strong short-term boost to efforts to stabilise the climate., “Placing stricter methane emission regulations on the fossil fuel industry will have the potential to reduce future global warming to a larger extent than previously thought,” Hmiel said. “Methane is important to study because if we make changes to our current methane emissions, it’s going to reflect more quickly.”, Other scientists who were not involved in the research concurred there were positive implications in the findings, but only if governments were able to rein in fossil fuel companies, which has not been the case until now., “This indicates that the fossil fuel sector has a much more polluting impact beyond being responsible for the overwhelming majority of carbon dioxide emissions. This is worrying and overall bad news,” said Dr Joeri Rogelj, a climate change lecturer at the Grantham Institute., The good news, Rogelj said, was that measures to prevent leaks, reduce flaring and switch to renewables would be more effective than expected. “What this study shows is that we can have a bigger impact on methane in the atmosphere than earlier thought. This allows us to set climate policy priorities right.”, Dave Reay, the executive director of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation, said one of the key messages from the study was that the old bottom-up method of measuring methane emissions was “woefully inadequate”., “We knew fossil fuel extraction – including fracking – was a major part of global methane emissions, but this impressive study suggests it is a far bigger culprit in human-induced climate change than we had ever thought,” he said., “If correct, gas, coal and oil extraction and distribution around the world are responsible for almost half of all human-induced methane emissions. Add to that all the carbon dioxide that is then emitted when the fossil fuels are burned, and you need look no further for the seat of the climate emergency fire.”oil gas industry far worse climate impact than thought fossil fuels methane", "label": 0}, "train-352": {"text": "\n'The worst thing is the waiting': flood-hit communities tell of stress\n, People affected by UK floods tell of their impact and ‘painful, disruptive aftermath’, \nMattha Busby, \n\nWed 19 Feb 2020 09.24 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2020 09.48 EST\n\n, Flooding not only wrecks businesses, destroys homes and disrupts everyday life but also causes long-lasting and dangerous levels of stress, residents from flood-hit communities have said., Hundreds of homes have been flooded and six people are thought to have died across England and Wales after heavy downpours and successive storms further exposed the fragility of flood defences and the gravity of the climate emergency., More flooding is expected as river levels continue to threaten to breach barriers. People in flood-hit areas are grappling with a seemingly relentless onslaught of extreme weather conditions, and are making preparations for the future while having to deal with the present consequences., “I am lucky, only one room of my house was flooded, but some people have had to leave everything,” Amanda Gillender, a 71-year-old painter from Eardisland on the River Arrow in Herefordshire, told the Guardian., The scale of the flooding in Gillender’s village has been unprecedented and there are record levels of water in rivers nearby. She fears life there may become untenable if the climate crisis is not taken seriously. But for now, her most immediate concern is dealing with her insurance claim as she assesses the damage to her 500-year old cottage., “The worst thing about flooding is the waiting and watching as the water rises foot after foot deep,” she said. “There’s nothing you can do. Once it has happened you’re completely isolated because you can’t go out and are left alone with the painful, disruptive aftermath.”, Elsewhere, the cumulative stress is having a grave impact on communities. “There are thousands of small human stories of stress, worry and disappointment,” said Rachel Buchanan, from the Ludlow area in Shropshire. “We’re all looking at river level websites now before going out. It just makes everyone a little less willing to leave their home.”, People are being prevented from getting to work and social events, caring for family members and attending to livestock, and are becoming ever more lonely, Buchanan believes., “You become slightly more isolated as the effects of the flooding encroach on everyday life,” she said. “A friend of mine who is a single mother simply won’t go out now. Small businesses are losing a day or a week of work and the roads are crumbling – it’s a mess.”, All across the UK, flooding has become more frequent and the impact can be felt years later. While insurance agents visit to assess how much compensation is to be paid out, houses in areas not previously classified as being at risk of flooding are revalued., Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system. , Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change., Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding. , Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America., When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California. , Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage., Global heating does not influence all extreme weather – natural variability still exists. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather., “One of our neighbours lost £70,000 in value,” says Ian Young, a father of two who lives with his partner on the Isle of Man and who was affected by flooding last year. “We lost both our cars and did not receive market value for them. Our premiums went through the roof as they had to go down as at-fault claims even though the vehicles were parked on the driveway and we weren’t in them.”, He and his family have been living in temporary accommodation since the beginning of October and work to repair his property, the ground floor of which was completely flooded, has only just begun., “It was absolutely horrific,” he said. “You spend years trying to build up your life centred around your home and garden and then you’re kicked out. We’ve lost a Christmas with our kids. They only believe in Father Christmas until they’re eight or nine. But it was a write-off not having our own home.”, In Surrey, where the Thames flooded twice in 2014, residents are still dealing with the consequences. “I don’t think we ever fully recovered from the experience,” said the fluid dynamicist and racing boat maker Carl Douglas. “It knocked the momentum out of us, left us poorer and messed up our business.”, Receiving an adequate payout from his insurers proved an “incredibly stressful” ordeal that he knows was not unique to himself, and in 2015 he developed circulatory problems that forced him to have a triple bypass operation., “The surgeon looked at me and said: ‘You look pretty fit for your age so I wouldn’t have expected you to need this procedure. But have you been under a lot of stress?’ ‘Oh yes,’ I replied,” Douglas said., In many cases, communities have pulled together to help those who are most affected. In Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, which has been hit by flooding over the last couple of years, neighbours have responded by helping older people move their possessions to safety, sharing route information on Facebook, offering spare bedrooms and helping to flood-proof homes., But people such as Rory Deighton, a 49-year-old NHS worker, are looking towards Westminster for real action. “If we get nothing again from a central government that ignores climate change, does not act on grouse shooting or discuss farming practices, and does not focus on how we can prevent flooding, then people will just ask: what’s the point?”worst thing is waiting flood hit communities stress uk flooding", "label": 0}, "train-353": {"text": "\nVictoria's Secret under fire after store dumps hundreds of bras in bin\n, Discovery draws criticism from those who say fashion industry generates too much waste, \nLeah Harper, \n\nWed 19 Feb 2020 08.53 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2020 09.08 EST\n\n, Hundreds of Victoria’s Secret bras have reportedly been found discarded in a bin close to a recently closed branch of the lingerie store in Colorado., The discovery comes at a time when the fashion industry is under fire for generating significant levels of waste, while Victoria’s Secret continues to face criticism regarding recent controversies., The discarded garments were found alongside other Victoria’s Secrets products by Colorado resident Melanie Gelinas, who lives upstairs from what had previously been a Victoria’s Secret store., “It had to be hundreds of bras and I just thought, ‘What a waste,’” she told American news network 9News, who originally reported the story. “These are all going to a landfill. They could be going to a homeless shelter or a battered women’s shelter.”, A spokesperson for Victoria’s Secret said: “We are sorry for how this may appear. Because this store was closing, we damaged out wrote off sample products including bras from our fitting rooms. All remaining inventory was reallocated to other stores.”, According to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap), 300,000 tonnes of clothing were sent to landfill in 2016 by the UK alone. The industry has come under pressure to improve its eco-credentials, with some brands introducing sustainable fabrics or in-store recycling initiatives – although these measures have also received some criticism, with allegations of “greenwashing”., This latest accusation against Victoria’s Secret follows a New York Times investigation earlier this month which found “widespread bullying and harassment of employees and models” at the brand. The company said it expressed regret., Last August, Victoria’s Secret’s chief marketing officer Ed Razek stepped down following his comments that the brand would not cast transgender or plus-sized models “because the show is a fantasy” and, in November, the brand announced it would be cancelling its once-popular televised fashion show following a slump in sales and viewership., Parent company L Brands Inc’s chief executive, Leslie Wexner, has also come under scrutiny for his close ties to convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein.victorias secret under fire after store dumps hundreds of bras in bin", "label": 0}, "train-354": {"text": "\nRed-state Utah embraces plan to tackle climate crisis in surprising shift\n, Utah aims to reduce emissions over air quality concerns as other red states are also starting to tackle global heating, \nAndrea Smardon in Salt Lake City, \n\nWed 19 Feb 2020 06.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2020 11.31 EST\n\n, In a move to protect its ski slopes and growing economy, Utah – one of the reddest states in the nation – has just created a long-term plan to address the climate crisis., And in a surprising turnaround, some of the state’s conservative leaders are welcoming it., “If we don’t think about Utah’s long-term future, who will?” Republican state house speaker Brad Wilson said at a recent focus group to discuss the proposals., At the request of the Republican-dominated state legislature, a University of Utah economic thinktank produced the plan to reduce emissions affecting both the local air quality and the global climate., Project lead Thomas Holst, an energy analyst, never expected to be at the helm of an effort like this. A few years ago, the Utah legislature passed a resolution urging the EPA to “cease its carbon dioxide reduction policies, programs, and regulations until climate data and global warming science are substantiated”., But now the perspectives of some state lawmakers – and of Holst, who spent most of his career in the oil and gas industry – have shifted., “The economist Adam Smith talked about an invisible hand that guides the economy, and in this particular case, the cost of renewable energy, whether it’s wind or solar, has gone down so rapidly and made itself so market efficient versus fossil fuels, that there is a change, and the change can’t be ignored,” Holst said. “So now is the opportunity for a state like Utah which is rich in both renewables as well as fossil fuels to embrace that change and get out ahead of it.”, Other red states and municipalities are slowly starting to address global heating. After banning the words “climate change” from state environmental agencies, Florida now has a chief resilience officer tasked with preparing for sea level rise. After a year of disastrous flooding, Nebraska lawmakers advanced a bill to develop a climate change plan for a full legislative debate. , Utah prides itself on being business friendly – and it has a rapidly growing tech sector concerned about environmental issues, as well as booming tourist economy that revolves around the ski industry and public lands., The Utah plan, known as the Utah Roadmap, began, like a number of recent environmental initiatives, with young people clamoring for action. High school students drafted a resolution that recognized the impacts of the climate crisis and encouraged emissions reductions, and persuaded two Republican lawmakers to sponsor it. Environmental advocates say it was the first measure of its kind to pass in a red state. The legislature followed up with state money for experts to provide policy recommendations., Another factor that has primed Utah leaders to address the climate crisis is the state’s unique air quality issues. The majority of the population lives in mountain valleys where in winter, temperature inversions can trap air pollutants, often reaching levels that impact health, particularly among children and the elderly., “It cuts across political lines. Clean air is not a partisan issue in our state,” said Utah speaker Wilson. He said there is not the same kind of consensus on climate change in the legislature, but “there is absolutely overlap between air quality concerns we have and reducing greenhouse gas emissions”., Natalie Gochnour, the head of the economic policy institute that drafted the Utah Roadmap, said its proponents managed to turn a hyper-partisan issue into a shared priority by emphasizing the local impacts of the climate crisis. Research suggests that framing policy around economic benefits and sustainability allows local leaders to respond to climate change without getting caught up in political divisions., “That tends to pull some of the politics out of it – not for everybody – but for many. I think enough to create momentum on Capitol Hill,” Gochnour said., Clean air concerns are also the reason officials are pushing Utah gas refineries to produce cleaner gasoline, and when the Trump administration announced plans to roll back clean car standards, Utah’s bipartisan clean air caucus held a press conference urging Congress to resist the move., It cuts across political lines. Clean air is not a partisan issue in our state, Holst, the roadmap project lead, acknowledged that blue coastal states have taken the initiative on ameliorating climate change, but he sees potential for Utah. “Is there an opportunity for a red state to take a leadership role? We believe that there is. And by composing a road map, by encouraging our legislative leaders to embrace this, we believe that there can be a change, and that Utah will be willing to take a leadership role,” he said., Utah’s per capita carbon emissions are higher than most states, in part because it’s nearly twice as reliant on coal, but utilities serving Utah customers plan to close many of their coal power plants by 2030, converting to wind, solar, natural gas, and possibly hydrogen. Republican state lawmaker Melissa Garff Ballard has an ambitious plan to make Utah a source of hydrogen power serving the western US., Among the Utah Roadmap’s top priorities is to reduce CO2 emissions by half over the next decade – a challenge for a state with a growing population. The plan suggests focusing on energy-efficient buildings and clean transportation options. It recommends expanding Utah’s network of charging stations, incentivizing the purchase of electric vehicles, and involving auto dealers in strategies to increase the zero-emissions vehicle supply., Business leaders have told Holst they are drafting a document that would pledge to move forward with the Utah Roadmap’s recommendations., “What I’m interested in is a viable future for the state of Utah,” Republican state representative Stephen Handy said. “There are still a number of Utah legislators who don’t want to look at the science that’s very obvious on climate change, but we’ve come a long way.”, This article was amended on 19 February 2020 to clarify Brad Wilson’s comments on clean air.utah republicans climate crisis plan", "label": 0}, "train-355": {"text": "\nMike and Annie Cannon-Brookes pledge $12m to supply solar systems for disaster relief\n, The billionaire couple want to provide ready-made solar and battery arrays to communities cut off from the power grid, \nAdam Morton, \n\nWed 19 Feb 2020 02.46 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 19 Feb 2020 16.15 EST\n\n, Software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have promised up to $12m to install solar and battery systems in communities disconnected from the electricity grid by bushfire or flood., The couple say they will provide prefabricated solar panel and battery systems through a new venture, known as Resilient Energy Collective, that will power up to 100 sites disconnected from the grid in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Some are relying on diesel generators, others are without power., Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian and a vocal supporter of stronger action to combat the climate crisis, said the goal was to find and fund a response that could be rolled out within days and, in some cases, become a long-term solution for electricity generation., He said Australia needed to “learn the lessons of this summer and invest in energy systems that help the planet, not hurt it”. Solar and batteries made sense because they were resilient, fast, flexible and reduced the cost of electricity, he said., “In the future, we see a world in which many remote communities operate on solar power, off the grid,” he said. “To get this done, we need the cooperation of the energy providers. We want to work with them to identify the areas most in need.”, Cannon-Brookes has previously joined Andrew Forrest as an investor in Sun Cable, an ambitious project to power Singapore using solar power from the Northern Territory outback, and strongly backed a bill by independent MP Zali Steggall that would set a national budget for greenhouse gas emissions and introduce five-yearly climate risk assessments., The Resilient Energy Collective project promises pre-built solar systems that can be “folded up, packed onto a truck for transport, unfolded and connected to your home or business in less than a day”., Systems are already operating in two locations. In one, near Cobargo in south-east NSW, solar panels and batteries were installed in two days to replace diesel generators powering radio towers used by police, the Rural Fire Service, NSW National Parks and the Eurobodalla shire council., A second system has been installed in east Gippsland to power the Goongerah community hall, which is being used by fire-affected locals for relief services, internet connection and refrigeration., The prototype systems, using equipment from solar innovation company 5B and battery provider Tesla, have been made available to energy providers, which then identify the sites most in need.

Here, on a skin-tingling frosty day, with the first rays of sunshine skimming the treetops, it scented the shadowy depths of the forest. In the original line from the film Apocalypse Now, the fragrance Lt Col Kilgore loved in the morning was napalm, and volatile secretions from these conifers share its sticky, explosively flammable properties. Indeed, heptane distilled from the resin of Jeffrey pine, Pinus jeffreyi, native to California, provides the zero point for octane rating, a measure of petrol’s resistance to exploding under compression., Standing here, in a grove of mature Norway spruces, it was easy to see the trees’ trade-off for producing such a combustible product: dribbles of coagulating resin oozed from wounds on damaged trunks, sealing them from fungal infection and deterring opportunist insects. (Amber, fossil resin, often contains entombed insects that stumbled into its gummy grip.) Like blood in capillaries in human skin, resin is carried in ducts that ramify through living tissue, from inner bark to the slenderest needles, leaking whenever outer defences are breached., In many conifers it has a distinctive fragrance. Foresters have told me that they could identify common species, eyes closed, simply with a “crush and sniff” test. I have tried it, but lack a scent memory trained by long experience., Differences can be complex and subtle, hard to describe in the restricted vocabulary of fragrance, which relies on subjective analogies to familiar, everyday scents. A hint of grapefruit emanates from the soft needles of Tsuga heterophylla, at odds with the description of those who named it western hemlock, thinking that it smelled like poisonous hemlock, Conium maculatum., Sensitive chemical analysis, using gas chromatography, can however provide a fragrance fingerprint of aromatic volatile compounds. One of the commonest components of resin is pinene, easily detected in the air in conifer forests on still, cold mornings. In 2015, biochemists in Japan measured a rise of pinene levels in the blood of visitors to conifer woodland: from under the bark of a tree to under the skin of a human within as little as 60 minutes. Maybe that’s why walking in this forest, inhaling this scented air, provided such a sense of wellbeing this morning.country diary smells like evergreen spirit", "label": 0}, "train-357": {"text": "\nColorado River flow shrinks from climate crisis, risking ‘severe water shortages’\n, Millions of people rely on the 1,450-mile waterway as increasing periods of drought and rising temperatures reduce flow of river, \nOliver Milman, \n\nThu 20 Feb 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2020 14.03 EST\n\n, The flow of the Colorado River is dwindling due to the impacts of global heating, risking “severe water shortages” for the millions of people who rely upon one of America’s most storied waterways, researchers have found., Increasing periods of drought and rising temperatures have been shrinking the flow of the Colorado in recent years and scientists have now developed a model to better understand how the climate crisis is fundamentally changing the 1,450-mile waterway., The loss of snow in the Colorado River basin due to human-induced global heating has resulted in the river absorbing more of sun’s energy, thereby increasing the amount of water lost in evaporation, the US Geological Survey scientists found., This is because snow and ice reflect sunlight back away from the Earth’s surface, a phenomenon known as the albedo effect. The loss of albedo as snow and ice melt away is reducing the flow of the Colorado by 9.5% for each 1C of warming, according to the research published in Science., The world has heated up by about 1C since the pre-industrial era and is on course for an increase of more than 3C by the end of the century unless planet-warming emissions are drastically cut. For the Colorado this scenario means an “increasing risk of severe water shortages”, the study states, with any increase in rainfall not likely to offset the loss in reflective snow., The magnitude of the Colorado’s decline as outlined in the Science paper is “eye popping”, according to Brad Udall, a senior scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on water supplies in the west who was not involved in the research., “This has important implications for water users and managers alike,” Udall said. “More broadly, these results tell us that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as soon as we possible can., “We’ve wasted nearly 30 years bickering over the science. The science is crystal clear – we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions immediately.”, The Colorado rises in the Rocky Mountains and slices through ranch lands and canyons, including the Grand Canyon, as it winds through the American west. It previously emptied into the Gulf of California in Mexico but now ends several miles shy of this due to the amount of water extraction for US agriculture and cities ranging from Denver to Tijuana., The river’s upper basin supplies water to about 40 million people and supports 16m jobs. It feeds the two largest water reserves in the US, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, with the latter supplying Las Vegas with almost all of its water., Snowpacks that last into late spring have historically fed streams that have nourished the Colorado River, as well as reducing the likelihood of major fires. As the climate heats up, the river is evaporating away and the risk of damaging wildfires is increasing., The climate crisis is compounding existing threats to the river, which include intensive water pumping for agriculture, water use by urban areas and the threat of pollution from uranium mining. Lake Mead, the vast reservoir formed by the Hoover dam, has dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s., A 19-year drought that racked stretches of the river almost provoked the US government to impose mandatory cuts in water use from the river last year, only for seven western states to agree to voluntary reductions. The problems are set to become more severe, however, as the climate becomes hotter and drier at a time when demand for water from expanding cities in the American west increases.colorado river flow shrinks climate crisis", "label": 0}, "train-358": {"text": "\nRajendra Pachauri obituary\n, \nFiona Harvey, \n\nThu 20 Feb 2020 12.38 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 31 Mar 2020 13.00 EDT\n\n, To stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis – already being felt in the form of extreme weather, fires and floods – we have only about a decade to cause greenhouse gas emissions to peak and then fall rapidly. That we know this is largely thanks to one global organisation, a loose collection of hundreds of academics around the world that has amassed our knowledge of the climate for more than 30 years., The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, convened in 1988 by the UN and the World Meteorological Organization, is made up of the world’s leading experts on climate science, who draw on thousands of academic papers to prepare comprehensive assessment reports about every five to seven years. Those reports are the gold standard, representing the summation of our knowledge of how the climate system works, and how we are affecting it., Rajendra Kumar Pachauri, who has died aged 79, served as the chairman of the IPCC from 2002 to 2015, a crucial period during which he oversaw its world-changing warnings and Nobel-winning acclaim, but which also brought humbling disaster for the organisation and for him personally., Few scientists were explicitly trained or practising in what was then an emerging discipline, and Pachauri was originally an engineer. Born in Nainital in India, he was educated at La Martinière College, Lucknow, and the Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical Engineering, before beginning his career with Indian Railways. He took higher engineering degrees in the US, and embarked on a variety of academic, public policy and business-related positions in the US and India, including a visiting fellowship at the World Bank and advisory work for the UN Development Programme., But it was his election as chairman of the IPCC in 2002 that marked a turning point. Climate science was in difficulty, and the prospect of climate action seemed to have stalled, as the early impetus that gave rise to the IPCC, then the first global treaty on the climate, the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and eventually the 1997 Kyoto protocol, had run into powerful vested political and business interests. The US Congress had failed to ratify Kyoto, while the White House, under George W Bush, had taken climate off the agenda. Progress seemed far off., The task for Pachauri – known as Patchy – was to reinvigorate the IPCC’s work, setting out the path to a comprehensive study that would become the Fourth Assessment Report in 2007. Its hard-hitting conclusions – that it was 90% certain that humanity was causing climate change, and that carbon emissions must start to fall within about 15 years to prevent catastrophic and irreversible effects – were instrumental in leading the UN to embark on a process that would eventually culminate in the Paris agreement of 2015., In recognition of this work, the IPCC was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2007, jointly with Al Gore., Pachauri had the diplomatic skills, organisational experience and profile to bring the IPCC together: a tricky role, because the organisation had to retain its clear scientific and political independence while providing uncomfortable advice to policymakers. But what struck next appeared to blindside him utterly. Shortly before a crunch UN conference in Copenhagen in 2009, hackers released a series of emails among climate scientists that allegedly revealed them conspiring to give a misleading impression of some data. The scientists were embroiled in a damaging row, but worse was to come for the IPCC., In early 2010, a trickle of findings emerged of mistakes in the landmark Fourth Assessment Report. Most were minor, but the most damaging claim was one that Himalayan glaciers could melt away by 2035, later found to be wrong and poorly sourced. The IPCC responded slowly and, many felt, inadequately. At the time, the organisation had little in the way of a permanent administrative infrastructure, and seemed to have no institutional procedure to answer the charges., Eventually, Pachauri enabled changes in the IPCC’s operations to tighten the review process, rule out some forms of data, and strengthen checks on all the material included. These changes were controversial too – some scientists regard the IPCC as too slow, because full assessment reports take nearly a decade to complete, and far too conservative, leaving out newer research and ignoring the potentially disastrous impacts of “tipping points” in the climate system., There were rumblings after the “climategate” scandal that a new chairman was needed, someone fresh who could move on from the mistakes, but it was a personal issue that ended Pachauri’s career. In 2015, a woman he worked with at the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in New Delhi accused him of stalking, sexual harassment and intimidation, in text messages, emails and WhatsApp groups. He denied the charges. Soon after, he resigned his IPCC role and from TERI, and largely retired from public life., Pachauri also helped to lead the emergence of India as a force in global scientific research. Independently of his IPCC role, he served as chairman and director general of TERI, having joined the organisation in 1982. Established in 1974 as a small research centre focusing on energy and natural resources by the industrialist JRD Tata, TERI has grown to more than 1,200 employees across India, with outposts in Africa, Japan, Europe and the US., He is survived by his wife, Saroj Puri, and by a son and two daughters., • Rajendra Kumar Pachauri, engineer and climate scientist, born 20 August 1940; died 13 February 2020rajendra pachauri obituary", "label": 0}, "train-359": {"text": "\nMeat company faces heat over ‘cattle laundering’ in Amazon supply chain\n, Brazil’s JBS says it can’t trace the origins of all stock, as concern grows over deforestation linked to beef industry, \nDom Phillips, \n\nThu 20 Feb 2020 09.13 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2020 10.00 EST\n\n, The world’s biggest meat company has frequently been accused of links to deforestation. Now JBS is facing growing pressure from Brazilian politicians and environmentalists to address the information gaps and transparency failings in its supply chain., Critics say these deficiencies mean JBS is unable to ensure it does not buy cattle from farms involved in illegal deforestation over a decade after promising to do so., Senator Fabiano Contarato, who presides over the environment commission, has called for Brazil’s environment and agriculture ministers to attend a Congress hearing. “These facts are serious and they should be investigated rigorously,” he said. “This is a form of cattle laundering.”, Amid mounting outrage over damage to the Amazon from deforestation and fires linked to cattle farming, the meat company’s lack of transparency is increasingly out of step with global finance. The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has now made sustainability integral to investing. The climate crisis dominated the 2020 World Economic Forum at Davos., But JBS remains unable to monitor a significant proportion of its suppliers despite operating deep in the Amazon. It is a problem for the entire meat industry in Brazil, but other companies, such as Marfrig, have come clean about the scale of the issue, and are taking action to resolve it. Meanwhile, JBS has refused to answer direct questions about exactly how much of its beef comes from so-called “indirect suppliers”., Further criticism has been levelled at the audits done on the JBS supply chain, which state openly that there is “no verification system” in place for indirect suppliers., “This is totally against ethical principles in relation to its consumers,” said Marina Silva, a former environment minister who won international awards for reducing deforestation and called for a certification programme. “These audits end up as more of a smokescreen.”, Last year joint investigative work by the Guardian, Repórter Brasil and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism showed the way that global meat demand was driving Amazon deforestation and revealed that fires were three times more common in Amazon beef farming areas., JBS operates sophisticated checks for cattle reaching its slaughterhouses from Amazon “full cycle” farms – where cattle are reared from birth to slaughter. These farms are also called “direct suppliers”., “The JBS monitoring system in the Amazon covers more than 280,000 sq miles, an area larger than Germany, and assesses more than 50,000 potential cattle-supplying farms every day,” the company said. “To date, we have blocked more than 8,000 cattle-supplying farms due to noncompliance.”, But this is only part of the picture. JBS does not monitor indirect suppliers in its supply chain. These are farms where cattle are birthed, or those who sell to farms where cattle are fattened, who then sell on to other farms or to slaughterhouses., Marfrig, JBS’s biggest competitor admits that half its cattle in the Amazon come from such suppliers, but JBS so far has refused to give figures to the Guardian’s direct question. And that, say environmentalists, prosecutors and researchers, is a big problem., “Cattle supply chains are really fluid and producers can move between the different roles and commonly sell as both direct suppliers and indirect suppliers,” said Holly Gibbs, a professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin who has monitored Amazon cattle supply chains for a decade. Her research showed that 80% of direct suppliers in the Amazon bought from other properties – on average up to 15 of them., “Direct suppliers often own multiple properties but only one is property is monitored,” she said. “The vast majority are either adjacent or within 1km.”, She compared the system to using air conditioning in a heatwave but leaving the windows open. “The cattle companies are monitoring direct suppliers but there are so many loopholes that the indirect suppliers can just come in and out,” she said., Last year Marfrig told the Guardian that 53% of its cattle purchases came from indirect suppliers. But JBS refused to discuss how many of its cattle came from indirect suppliers and declined to make a spokesperson available for interview., “JBS is committed to eradicating deforestation, ensuring sustainable livestock practices and improving the livelihoods of farmers in the Amazon region,” the company said by email. “We have worked for more than a decade on the frontlines, driving meaningful, responsible change in the region. We urge those who share the common goal of ending deforestation to seek solutions rather than criticism. We will only meet this collective challenge and preserve this important biome through collaboration and action.”, But the company has been making these promises for more than a decade. In 2009 a devastating report from Greenpeace led to JBS, Marfrig and Minerva (another Brazilian meat giant) signing a landmark cattle agreement with the environmental NGO. The meat companies promised not to buy from any direct suppliers involved in deforestation and to expand that commitment to include indirect suppliers within two years., The same year federal prosecutors in Amazon states signed agreements with more than a dozen meat companies, including JBS, Marfrig and Minerva., “It was a watermark,” said Greenpeace Brazil’s senior forest campaigner Adriana Charoux., Deforestation fell afterwards, said Daniel Azeredo, a federal prosecutor who played a key role in the prosecutors’ deal., But he noted: “It talked about the direct suppliers, those that sell to slaughterhouse, not those who sell to another farm.” A clause in the deal requiring companies to start monitoring indirect suppliers had no deadline, he said., In 2017, JBS was fined R$24.7m (£4.2m) by Brazil’s government environment agency Ibama for buying 49,000 cattle in the Amazon state of Pará from illegally deforested areas – some via indirect suppliers. Following the fine, Greenpeace abandoned the cattle agreement. “Our credibility would have been completely at risk if we continued with them,” Charoux said., The deal with prosecutors still stands, but Azeredo believes meat companies should be doing more. “All the companies working in the Amazon know that indirect suppliers is a serious problem,” he said., When asked about these issues, JBS points journalists to the independent audits performed by Norwegian company DNV.GL, the latest of which reported that no irregularities relating to deforestation in 7,140 Amazon cattle transactions were found during 2018. The same company audits Marfrig., But the 2019 audit added a caveat, as it also did in 2018. “Regarding indirect suppliers, JBS and the industry in general does not yet have in place a verification system in these cases,” it said., Critics questioned an audit that failed to check out the entire supply chain. “Nobody is going to buy the animals if they don’t know where they are from, or if they are healthy,” said Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting and finance at the University of Sheffield. “If there is a trail, that makes the auditors’ omission even more damning.”, DNV.GL has been doing audits for Marfrig since 2011 and for JBS since 2018. “Our role is to assess adherence to the ‘minimum criteria for transactions with cattle and beef products on an industrial scale in the amazon biome’,” a spokesperson said in an email, referring to the terms of the deal with Greenpeace signed in 2009 – but crucially, not the promise to start monitoring indirect suppliers within two years, by 2011., “Indirect suppliers’ information was requested, however the companies do not have this information,” DNV.GL said. “In both cases a non-conformity was raised.”, “In the case of indirect suppliers, JBS has not yet been successful in implementing traceability processes,” the audit’s “non-conformity” entry read., Since 2013, Marfrig has used a self-declaratory mechanism called a request form of information (RFI) in which the farm delivering the cattle is required to supply the name of its supplier, including tax number and the name of the farm. A spokesperson said last year that 30% of its cattle supply from the Amazon came with the form, which it is working with the World Wildlife Fund and other non-profit groups to improve., “For me, RFI is a good tool even though it is voluntary,” said Mauro Armelin, executive director of Friends of the Earth Brazil. “It has a good chance of success.”, Armelin said monitoring systems could also make use of state and federal government information on cattle movements, produced for sanitary controls. But last year, the Brazilian government restricted access to sanitary control documents that had previously been accessible., “It’s critical that this data stays available,” Gibbs from the University of Wisconsin said. “It’s very challenging to monitor indirect suppliers.”, DNV.GL stated that the government documents “are not public” and that JBS and other companies have been trying to get access to them from the ministry without success., But other researchers have succeeded in accessing them in the past.Using these documents and information from Brazilian government registers and databases, University of Wisconsin researchers and the US National Wildlife Federation developed their own monitoring system: Visipec; a free cloud-based tool that can be plugged into cattle companies’ current monitoring systems., “Increasingly, they’re open and there’s a lot of discussions happening,” Gibbs said of the meat companies. But so far, she said, not one of them has taken it up., It was announced on Thursday that JBS is buying American meat-packing company Empire Packing Company for $238m (£185m).meat company faces heat over cattle laundering in amazon supply chain", "label": 0}, "train-360": {"text": "Grouse moors owners threatened government with legal action, Ministers were planning to ban environmentally harmful practice of burning old heather , Owners of large grouse moors threatened to take legal action against government ministers who had started developing plans to ban repeated heather burning, Whitehall documents have disclosed., The landowners issued the threat after ministers started working on producing a law to ban them from carrying out the environmentally damaging practice on their moorland estates. The old heather is burned to expose new shoots – a source of food for grouse, whose numbers are boosted. The estates then charge people who want to shoot grouse., They said they were upset with the way the government was consulting with them and others who would be affected by the proposed ban., The government started to draw up a compulsory ban after unsuccessfully attempting to persuade the landowners to end the practice voluntarily., Green campaigners have been calling for an end to the practice as they argue it harms the environment and wildlife by releasing climate-changing gases into the atmosphere, worsening flooding and degrading a precious habitat., They criticised the landowners for threatening legal action. Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner with the Friends of the Earth group, said: “Why are a small elite of landowners still allowed to get away with these damaging slash-and-burn practices, and throwing their weight around in this way?”, The documents, which relate to meetings between the government and the Moorland Association, a lobbying body which represents landowners controlling a million acres of upland moorland in England, have been released to Friends of the Earth under the Freedom of Information Act., Last summer the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the Moorland Association that it was beginning to develop legislation to ban the rotational burning of heather on peatland known as blanket bog., Defra officials said they had started a consultation to gather evidence to evaluate how the proposed ban would affect the owners of grouse moor estates and others., On 21 August Nick Downshire, the association’s chairman, wrote to Defra to say that the landowners were “alarmed” at the “shortcomings” of the consultation and wanted it to be widened and reissued., He said a meeting the association had with Defra three weeks earlier appeared to be “something in the manner of a box-ticking exercise, rather than genuine engagement”., “It also exposes Defra to further legal challenge in respect of the validity and lawfulness of the consultation as a whole – a challenge the association would take forward if … members’ concerns and feedback are not taken into account as this process unfolds”., He outlined a series of steps that Defra needed to implement to take into account the views of the landowners and others when the government formulated the proposed ban., “Each of these steps is, in our view, imperative to guard against the impression, or indeed the reality, that Defra’s commitment to the consultation process is half-hearted or legally inadequate. A failure to take any of these steps will require the association to consider legal intervention”., He said the landowners and others should be given more time to respond to the consultation. On 30 August, a Defra official told the association that the consultation would not be reissued with its suggested changes, although the deadline would be extended for a short period., Defra says it intends to ban the burning of heather and will publish its plans shortly. When questioned about its intentions last month, Zac Goldsmith, a junior environment minister, said “one way or another this needs to stop”., According to the documents, the government decided, in 2017, to give the landowners two years to voluntarily stop the practice before deciding whether a ban was needed., Amanda Anderson, the Moorland Association’s director, said: “Our members had very serious concerns over the structure of the consultation, which we raised with Defra., “In particular, we were deeply worried, and still are, about the potential environmental and conservation consequences of land being left without sustainable management alternatives., “Since then, we have had continued to have constructive discussions with Defra and Natural England over how best to find a mutually workable solution that will help achieve the shared goal of deep peat restoration.”grouse moors owners threaten government with legal action", "label": 0}, "train-361": {"text": "\nFates of humans and insects intertwined, warn scientists\n, Experts call for solutions to be enforced immediately to halt global population collapses, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nThu 20 Feb 2020 05.16 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2020 05.19 EST\n\n, The “fates of humans and insects are intertwined”, scientists have said, with the huge declines reported in some places only the “tip of the iceberg”., The warning has been issued by 25 experts from around the world, who acknowledge that little is known about most of the estimated 5.5 million insect species. However, enough was understood to warrant immediate action, they said, because waiting for better data would risk irreversible damage., The researchers said solutions were available and must be implemented immediately. These range from bigger nature reserves and a crackdown on harmful pesticides to individual action such as not mowing the lawn and leaving dead wood in gardens. They also said invertebrates must no longer be neglected by conservation efforts, which tend to focus on mammals and birds., The alert has been published as two articles in the Biological Conservation journal., “The current insect extinction crisis is deeply worrisome. Yet, what we know is only the tip of the iceberg,” the scientists write. “We know enough to act immediately. Solutions are now available – we must act upon them.”, “Insect declines lead to the loss of essential, irreplaceable services to humanity. Human activity is responsible for almost all current insect population declines and extinctions.”, Insect population collapses have been reported in Germany, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. The first global scientific review, published in February 2019, said widespread declines threatened to cause a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”. Insects pollinate three-quarters of crops, and another recent study showed widespread losses of such insects across Britain., The report notes that only about a fifth of the world’s insect species have even been named, mostly from only single specimens., “Many insect species are going extinct even before being described,” the researchers said. “It is likely that insect extinctions since the industrial era are around 5-10%, ie 250,000 to 500,000 species.”, This estimate is based on the extinctions of land snails. Prof Pedro Cardoso, at the Finnish Museum of Natural History and the lead author of the latest report, said: “It is the best estimate we have. There is no reason to think the trends are different between insects and land snails, but snails leave their shells behind as evidence.”, The paper also notes that British butterfly and beetle populations were said to be “fast disappearing” in the 1870s by the entomologist Archibald Swinton., Long-term data on insect populations is rare. “We don’t know everything – in fact we know very little – but if we wait until we have better information to act it might be too late to recover many species,” Cardoso said., “Many species are declining, probably the majority, and overall it seems the trend is for a large decline. But there are of course some species that are benefitting, for example the swarms of locusts currently in east Africa.”, Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of the conservation group Buglife, said a key report in 2016 told world governments that declines in wild pollinators presented risks to societies and ecosystems., “However, in a repeat of the failure of politicians to respond to scientific warnings about climate change, the cautious, scientific language used has not produced an appropriate response from governments,” he said., “Scientists are now turning up the heat on insect declines in the hope that politicians will understand the urgency and the link to human survival, and will take action before it is too late.”, The key causes of insect losses, according to the scientists, are the destruction of natural habitat for farming and buildings; the intensive use of pesticides; industrial pollution and light pollution; and invasive alien species; and the climate crisis., As well as large-scale solutions, Cardoso said insect-friendly gardens could help halt the decline. “When lots of people implement these small solutions, it can make a big difference to many insect populations. Even a couple of gardens could be a big thing for a species.”, He said a change of mindset was also needed because many people had learned to dislike insects. “I’ve never seen any small children – two, three or four years old – who were afraid of insects or spiders.

But a major widespread event is not currently taking place., “We are down to the wire,” said Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University., The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is closely monitoring conditions. Areas of heat stress are spreading, particularly across the central and southern areas that are popular with tourists., Sea surface temperatures (SST) are already more than 1.5C above average across large areas of the reef, with a month remaining until temperatures usually peak., Across about two thirds of the reef – from Port Douglas south – SST were between 2C and 3C above average., Coral bleaching is a stress reaction caused when corals spend long periods in warmer than average water. The algae that provides food and the coral’s colour separates from the animal., Severe bleaching can kill some corals, and weaken others. As well as bleaching, corals can die from more immediate heat stress if temperatures become extreme., Rising ocean temperatures are caused by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere., Hughes told Guardian Australia: “We are worried about the level of heat that’s out there now, with four weeks still to go until we get the peak of summer temperatures. That’s usually around mid-March., “So with about a month to go, the pattern so far is following in the footsteps of 2016-17 and it’s already hotter than it was in the interim years., “If it happens or not will depend on the vagaries of the weather for the next two weeks.”, Will we see mass #coral bleaching again this year on the #GreatBarrierReef?Left plot shows heat stress in 2019 (no significant bleaching) and so far this summer.

We will know in the next couple of weeks whether we now have a mass coral bleaching event for the third time in only five years., “Surely after this summer of bushfires, and this marine heatwave hitting the reef, we cannot keep burying our heads in the sand. We need a reef-safe climate policy that’s consistent with a 1.5C global warming target, or less. No more excuses will be tolerated.”, Shani Tager, the Australian Marine Conservation Society’s Great Barrier Reef campaigner, said: “The last thing our reef, and the coastal communities that it supports, needs right now is another summer of mass bleaching., “Unfortunately we are a whisker away from bleaching disaster yet again because of global warming-driven marine heatwaves.”, The World Heritage Committee is scheduled to review the status of the Great Barrier Reef at a meeting in June in China, with the potential to place the reef on its “in danger” list.great barrier reef on brink of third major coral bleaching in five years scientists warn", "label": 0}, "train-363": {"text": "'They define the continent': nearly 150 eucalypt species recommended for threatened list, Scientists’ call follows national assessment that finds gum trees in Western Australia wheat belt suffering worst rate of decline, An iconic Western Australian eucalypt, known for the size of flowers, is among almost 150 eucalpyt species scientists have recommended be listed as threatened under national environment laws., The eucalyptus macrocarpa, commonly known as mottlecah, has the largest flowers of all eucalypt species. The bright red flowers can measure up to 10cm in diameter., It is one of 147 eucalypt species that a team of scientists has recommended be added to Australia’s national threatened species list., Eucalypts in the wheat belt of Western Australia were identified as having the worst rate of decline, with about 60 species in this region identified by the researchers as qualifying for a listing as either vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered., Rod Fensham, an associate professor at the University of Queensland, led the research that used maps of eucalyptus distribution and maps of land use to measure which species were in decline., “Eucalypts are just fundamentally Australian. They define the continent, really,” Fensham said. “Everywhere you are in Australia there will be a gum tree, and the gum tree will tell you something about where you are.”, The scientists assessed all 822 eucalypt species found in Australia and determined 193 (23%) were threatened. Before the research, 89 eucalypts were listed as threatened under national laws. The paper suggests that 32 of these species could be removed from that list., Eucalypts are long-lived species and the scientists measured their trajectory over 10 generations., “Ten generations is quite a long time,” Fensham said. “But there are many species, including ones that were recommended for listing, that are showing such a steep rate of decline through the course of European history that that’s their trajectory, that they’ll be extinct in 10 generations.”, Fensham said this included relatively common species that drivers would be used to seeing along highways on the east coast between Sydney and Melbourne., The greatest threat to eucalpyts by far was conversion of land by the agriculture industry for cropping or pasture. That was followed by urban development., Species such as the mottlecah in WA’s wheat belt were under particular threat because intensive land use was occurring over a large area where there was also a high number of eucalypt species., “The No 1 conservation measure is stop land clearing, stop clearing habitat,” Fensham said. “It always is and we still haven’t managed to do it in Australia.”, Late last year, the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s updated Red List reached similar results, finding almost a quarter of the world’s eucalypts were threatened with extinction., , , they define the continent nearly 150 eucalypt species recommended for threatened list", "label": 0}, "train-364": {"text": "\nFirms making billions from ‘highly hazardous’ pesticides, analysis finds\n, Use of harmful chemicals is higher in poorer nations, according to data analysed by Unearthed, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nThu 20 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2020 11.32 EST\n\n, The world’s biggest pesticide companies make billions of dollars a year from chemicals found by independent authorities to pose high hazards to human health or the environment, according to an analysis by campaigners., The research also found a higher proportion of these highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs) in the companies’ sales in poorer nations than in rich ones. In India, 59% of sales were of HHPs in contrast to just 11% in the UK, according to the analysis., The data from Phillips McDougall, the leading agribusiness analysts, are from buyer surveys focused on the most popular products in the 43 nations that buy the most pesticides. It was obtained and analysed by Unearthed, a journalism group funded by Greenpeace UK, and the Swiss NGO Public Eye., The pesticides market is dominated by five companies – Bayer, BASF, Syngenta, FMC and Corteva (formerly Dow and DuPont). These companies sold $4.8bn of products containing HHPs in 2018, making up more than 36% of all their income, according to the analysis. Bayer said the analysis was “misleading” but declined to provide its own figures. Some companies also disputed the list of HHPs used. Phillips McDougall said that it neither approved the public use of its data nor endorsed the findings of the analysis by Unearthed., The Unearthed and Public Eye analysis calculated that almost a quarter of sales by the big five were of products containing pesticides linked to human health effects, including known or presumed carcinogens, while 10% came from pesticides toxic to bees. Another 4% of sales were of chemicals that are acutely toxic to humans, the analysis found. About 200,000 suicides each year are attributed to pesticide poisoning, almost all in developing countries., In rich countries, the average proportion of sales that were HHPs was 27% compared with 45% in low and middle income countries, reaching as high as 65% in South Africa, according to the analysis., A global survey of pesticide management in 2018 by the World Health Organization and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) found “various critical shortcomings”, with countries needing to strengthen their rules and enforcement to “minimise their harmful effects on humans and the environment”., Baskut Tuncak, UN special rapporteur on hazardous substances and human rights, said: “It is inappropriate for companies to earn such significant income from HHPs in this day and age. The continued use of these products is unsustainable and is causing a multitude of human rights violations around the world.”, A report in 2017 co-authored by Tuncak accused pesticide companies of the “systematic denial of harms”, “aggressive, unethical marketing tactics” and lobbying of governments, which has “obstructed reforms and paralysed global pesticide restrictions”. It also said the idea that pesticides were essential to feed a fast-growing global population was “a myth”., Unearthed used a list of 330 HHPs compiled by Pesticide Action Network International (PAN), based on judgments from authorities such as the US Environmental Protection Agency, European Union bodies, the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants and the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)., The FAO and WHO classify some but not all of these pesticides as HHPs on their list and a spokesman for BASF said the PAN list was “inflated”. Keith Tyrell, director of PAN UK, said: “Efforts to strengthen the UN’s approach are consistently blocked by the pesticide industry.”, Croplife International, the pesticide industry’s lobby group, has accepted that 15% of the chemicals its members sell are HHPs, but said many of these can be used safely in practice., “Our members support the voluntary FAO International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management,” said a CropLife International spokeswoman. “We support countries to identify, and if necessary, remove HHPs from their markets.” Neither CropLife International nor the five companies responded to a request for an example of the voluntary removal of an HHP., “Pesticides identified on the PAN list are often classified based on the acute toxicity of the active ingredient rather than the formulated product, which is not consistent with practical use,” said the CropLife International spokeswoman., Tyrell said: “Pesticide companies refuse to publish information on the ingredients contained in their products so the UN and others, including PAN, are forced to look solely at the toxicity of the active ingredient.”, Bayer also disputes PAN’s list. For example, PAN includes Bayer’s glyphosate on its list based on the 2015 conclusion of the IARC that it is “probably carcinogenic to humans”. But Bayer says glyphosate should not be on the list, based on the conclusions of other bodies, such as the European Chemical Agency in 2017., A spokesman for Bayer said the differing sales from nation to nation reflected the different needs of farmers: “Agriculture is very different from region to region due to different climates, pests, diseases and crops. In Brazil, for example, farmers must manage pests such as Asian Soybean Rust or insect pressure which don’t exist in Europe.”, He also disputed the financial analysis by Unearthed and Public Eye: “Bayer finalised the acquisition of Monsanto on 7 June 2018. Before, Bayer had divested parts of its businesses to competitors. Their calculations are therefore misleading.” Asked to provide alternative figures, he said: “Bayer doesn’t break down its sales figures by country, product or active ingredient. These figures are confidential.” Unearthed said its analysis follows standard practice for the financial analysis of merged companies., A spokeswoman for BASF said: “BASF is convinced of the safety of its products when they are used correctly following the label instructions and stewardship guidelines. All products are extensively tested, evaluated and approved by public authorities in the respective countries. Additionally, all active ingredients in these products are approved in at least one OECD country.”, Tuncak said: “Systemic issues in many low- and middle-income countries prevent any reasonable assurance of proper handling and use of pesticides.”, Juman Kubba, at Greenpeace UK, said: “Keeping the world hooked on an industrial farming model based on crops drenched in toxic pesticides is in these companies’ interests. But these dangerous chemicals have no place in a healthy food system and governments must ban them worldwide.”, FMC referred the Guardian to the response from CropLife International and Syngenta and Corteva did not respond to requests for comment., • This article was amended on 28 February 2020 to include a statement from Phillips McDougall that was received after publication.

Over there, in the centre of Bere Alston, red crab apples cling to ornamental trees and a nearby line of washing billows dry beside the wind-rocked branches of pink camellia. Blasting across from Hingston Down, gusts buffet full-out daffodils on top of hedges; more sheltered lanes drop downhill between banks of pennywort and moss overhung by swaying catkins., Towards Tuckermarsh Quay, past the bridge over a cutting of the derelict Southern Railway (linking Plymouth with Waterloo via Okehampton), woodland overwhelms formerly cultivated plots.

Out in the open and beneath the viaduct, a path continues on the levee separating vacated green pastures of Ferry Farm from straw-coloured reedbeds lapped by the flooding tide. Around the Danescoombe bend, Cotehele’s chapel in the wood perches on a rocky promontory among lichen-encrusted trees; downstream, the tide-washed “hard” beneath South Ward Mine was the landing stage for an established ferry across this waterway.

About 4,000 horses were estimated to be in those areas., Almost 90% of the Nungar plain and Boggy and Kiandra plains area had been impacted by fire, NPWS said, and 10% of Cooleman plain. A spokesperson said the areas contained threatened species and sensitive ecological communities “which are most vulnerable to trampling and other impacts of horses”., “As many horses as possible will be rehomed. Some horses will go to the knackery.”, The number of horses in the national park has been growing rapidly, causing concern that the damage caused by their hard hooves is adding to the pressure on sensitive alpine areas and putting some native species at risk., Recent surveys suggest the number of horses in alpine areas has more than doubled in the past five years to more than 25,000. , The population in the national park was estimated to have risen from 6,000 in 2014 to 19,000 in 2019, NPWS said. Extensive fires in the park this summer had caused further damage to the alpine areas as horses tried to escape, concentrating them in some areas., Managing the feral horses in alpine areas has long been a deeply contentious issue. The animals escaped from, or were abandoned by, colonisers in the 19th century., Kean’s announcement came during an ABC radio interview on Wednesday morning and reported the outcome of a meeting of the Kosciuszko national park wild horse community advisory panel., Kean said: “It’s the first time for a long time that we have had all the players at the table and it sounds like something we can live with. There was consensus among horse-lovers and national park-lovers about three areas where we need to completely remove the horses from.”, A monitoring program would be introduced, and fencing to prevent other horses moving in, he said., Asked if there would be a cull of the horses, he said all options were on the table but the focus would be on humane treatment of the animals, with physical removal the first option. He said the plan should help protect habitats of the vulnerable broad-toothed rat and critically endangered corroboree frogs., The advisory panel was convened after the wild horse management bill was introduced in 2018 by the NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro, whose Monaro seat covers parts of the park. Kean and Barilaro have clashed over the issue, but Kean credited Barilaro with establishing the process that led to the announcement., In a statement to Guardian Australia, Barilaro said the focus was “to find a balance between the environment and the cultural connection of the brumbies to the Kosciuszko national park”., He said: “This approach has proven that it can bring everyone together to let common sense prevail. It was this approach that identified the three areas of Kosciuszko national park that should see immediate reduction of horse numbers using humane methods., “There is a question mark around if there are in fact 4,000 horses in those areas, but regardless, the commitment we made to reduce horse numbers to a population of 3,000 still stands.”, The chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, Andrew Cox, said the announcement was a “major step forward” and a “positive initiative”, especially after parts of the park had been hit by bushfires., He told Guardian Australia the new plan should be seen as an emergency measure that would be a saviour for the park’s conservation in the aftermath of the fires., “There are thousands and thousands of horses – some were burned – and they are just making a mess of the park,” he said. “It’s necessary that large numbers are removed because virtually nothing has been done for three years.”, Cox said the horses were driving species to extinction and the bushfires were now magnifying their impact.thousands of feral horses to be removed from kosciuszko national park after bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-367": {"text": "\nNSW government drops forestry privatisation plan after bushfires devastate plantation\n, Deputy premier John Barilaro says the government’s priority is ‘getting new trees in the ground and strengthening the industry’, Australian Associated Press, \n\nWed 19 Feb 2020 19.59 EST\n\n, The New South Wales government won’t proceed with privatising Forestry Corporation’s softwood plantation business after an unprecedented bushfire season., The government decided to forgo a long-term lease of the business after a five-month investigation which took into account recent damage to the state’s forestry assets., About 25% of Forestry Corporation’s softwood division suffered fire damage over the summer., NSW deputy premier John Barilaro said the government’s priority was to help the forestry industry get back on its feet., “Regrowing our forests, getting new trees in the ground, and strengthening the industry so its long-term future is secure is where we are focusing our energy,” Barilaro said in a statement on Thursday., The decision comes after Guardian Australia revealed in December the NSW government was poised to privatise state forests to raise $1bn for infrastructure projects., The long-term lease of Forestry Corporation’s 230,000 hectares of softwood plantations was expected to be one of the first assets off the block., The state forests produce about 14% of Australia’s timber, including much of the supply for the housing industry.nsw government drops forestry privatisation plan after bushfires devastate plantation", "label": 0}, "train-368": {"text": "\nGreat Barrier Reef could face 'most extensive coral bleaching ever', scientists say\n, This year’s bleaching likely to be widespread although less intensive than previous outbreaks, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nFri 21 Feb 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2020 14.03 EST\n\n, The Great Barrier Reef could be about to experience its most widespread outbreak of mass coral bleaching ever seen, according to an analysis from the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration., But the analysis, seen by Guardian Australia, says while bleaching could hit the entire length of the world heritage-listed reef, the impacts may not be as intense as previous major outbreaks., Pockets of bleaching are being seen in areas including Lizard Island, north of Cooktown, and more than 1,100 kilometres south-east at Heron Island, off Gladstone., On Thursday, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, conservationists and scientists warned that heat stress was building along most of the 2,300-kilometre reef along Queensland’s north coast., Temperatures would need to drop from current levels over the next two weeks if the reef was to avoid a third mass bleaching event in five years., Dr William Skirving, of Noaa’s Coral Reef Watch, prepared a briefing on the “status of heat stress on the GBR” on 19 February., The agency’s observations and model forecasts suggested that “2020 is likely to be the most extensive coral bleaching event that we have seen so far” on the reef., He told Guardian Australia: “We are pretty confident that it’s likely there will be bleaching right up and down the reef and you will find very few reefs that don’t have some bleaching.”, While bleaching would be extensive, the intensity of the heat may not reach previous major bleaching events, Skirving said., In 2016 and 2017, back-to-back bleaching killed about half the reef’s corals., He said: “I’m expecting a bit of mortality but I don’t think this will get to the levels where we have seen large-scale mortality.”, Corals bleach if they sit in unusually warm waters for long periods. The algae that provides food and the coral’s colour separate from the animal, leaving behind a visible white skeleton., Severe bleaching can kill some corals, and weaken others. Extreme heat can also kill corals almost immediately., Skirving’s analysis identified a key period from 26 February to 4 March when widespread bleaching was likely to hit., During this time, tides would be weak, meaning there was less mixing of the waters that help dissipate heat through the water column. At the same time, the unusually high ocean temperatures would remain., He said: “We will see temperatures rocket through through that period. But if it does get really bad is yet to be seen – it depends on rain and wind – and neither of those can be precisely predicted.”, His analysis said only a significant weather event “such as a cyclone” during that eight-day period would save the reef from widespread bleaching., The world’s oceans have taken up about 93% of the extra energy caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, according to the UN’s climate science panel., According to the panel, it had high confidence that tropical coral reefs “are projected to reach a very high risk of impact at 1.2°C of global warming, with most available evidence suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this temperature or higher.”, Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a marine biologist at the University of Queensland, whose early work helped to explain the link between coral bleaching and climate change, said in the past two weeks, “the risk factors for major bleaching events, like elevated water temperatures” had “increased dramatically”., Skirving said it appeared large-scale bleaching events were happening more frequently on the reef, and listed 1983, 1987, 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and “now likely 2020”., While reefs could “bounce back” from bleaching events, there was concern individual reefs would not have enough time to recover between each outbreak., Dr Lyle Vail, director of the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island Research Station, said on Friday there was already bleaching on some corals there., “Alarm bells are ringing, we’re in troubled waters,” he said., Lizard Island was badly hit by bleaching in 2016. Vail added: “The coral recovery was coming along nicely so it’s hard to see it bleaching again, fingers crossed for some cloud cover and rain to cool things down.”, Several scientists working at Heron Island and the nearby One Tree Island have also been sharing images of corals beginning to bleach., Dr Tracy Ainsworth, a coral biologist at UNSW, has been with a team of scientists at a research station on Heron Island since 15 January., “We have been recording bleaching in the lagoon and reef flat and some exposed areas of the reef, and that’s concerning. A lot of the reef is fine though in the wave-exposed areas.”, I've been on Heron Island for a month measuring community calcification and production with our team @CoralTrace @BillLeggat1 @jesseb3rg @thedivinggoose.

It says most estimates of the likely economic and health costs are far too small because they fail to account for the loss of wealth, the discount rate and the possibility of increased natural disasters., The authors say policymakers need to change direction because a business-as-usual climate policy “would likely push the earth to a place that we haven’t seen for many millions of years”, with outcomes that might be impossible to reverse., “Although precise predictions are not possible, it is clear that the Earth is on an unsustainable trajectory. Something will have to change at some point if the human race is going to survive.”, The investment bank says climate change “reflects a global market failure in the sense that producers and consumers of CO2 emissions do not pay for the climate damage that results.” To reverse this, it highlights the need for a global carbon tax but cautions that it is “not going to happen anytime soon” because of concerns about jobs and competitiveness., The authors say it is “likely the climate situation will continue to deteriorate, possibly more so than in any of the IPCC’s scenarios”., Without naming any organisation, the authors say changes are occurring at the micro level, involving shifts in behaviour by individuals, companies and investors, but this is unlikely to be enough without the involvement of the fiscal and financial authorities., Last year, analysis compiled for the Guardian by Rainforest Action Network, a US-based environmental organisation, found JP Morgan was one of 33 powerful financial institutions to have provided an estimated total of $1.9tn (£1.47tn) to the fossil fuel sector between 2016 and 2018., A JP Morgan spokesperson told the BBC the research team was “wholly independent from the company as a whole, and not a commentary on it”, but declined to comment further. The metadata on the pdf of the report obtained by Read said the document was created on 13 January and that the author of the file was Gabriel de Kock, an executive director at JP Morgan. The Guardian has approached the investment bank for comment., Pressure from student strikers, activist shareholders and divestment campaigners has prompted several major institutions to claim they will make the climate more of a priority. The business model of fossil fuel companies is also weakening as wind and solar become more competitive. Earlier this month, the influential merchant bank Goldman Sachs downgraded ExxonMobil from a “neutral” to a “sell” position. In January, BlackRock – the world’s biggest asset manager – said it would lower its exposure to fossil fuels ahead of a “significant reallocation of capital”., Environmental groups remain wary because huge sums are invested in petrochemical firms, but some veteran financial analysts say the tide is changing. The CNBC money pundit Jim Cramer shocked many in his field when he declared: “I’m done with fossil fuels. They’re done. They’re just done.” Describing how a new generation of pension fund managers was withdrawing support, he claimed oil and gas firms were in the death knell phase. “The world has turned on them. It’s actually happening kind of quickly. You’re seeing divestiture by a lot of different funds. It’s going to be a parade that says, ‘Look, these are tobacco. And we’re not going to own them,’” he said. “We’re in a new world.”jp morgan economists warn climate crisis threat human race", "label": 0}, "train-370": {"text": "\nThe week in wildlife – in pictures\n, The week in wildlife – in pictures, The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including chinstrap penguins and a koala up a tree , , \n\nFri 21 Feb 2020 11.05 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2020 11.32 EST\n\n, Photograph: Sergei Karpukhin/Tass/Getty, Photograph: Raymond Roig/AFP via Getty, Photograph: Mike Symes/Devon Wildlife Trust/PA, Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/AP, Photograph: Yonhap/EPA, Photograph: Yuri Smityuk/Tass/Getty, Photograph: Niranjan Shrestha/AP, Photograph: Alexander Ley/Barcroft Media/Getty, Photograph: Douglas Gimesy/The Guardian, Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP via Getty, Photograph: Cheryl Ames/The National Aquarium/AFP via Getty, Photograph: Barrett Hedges/Getty/National Geographic Image Collection RF, Photograph: Chamila Karunarathne/EPA, Photograph: Geraldine Werhahn/Himalayan Wolves Project, Photograph: Christian Åslund/Greenpeace, Photograph: Sam Rowley/Wildlife Photographer of the Year, Photograph: AP, Photograph: Guillem Sartorio/AFP via Getty, Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters, Photograph: RSPCA/PA, Photograph: Sean Wu/ENB/IISDthe week in wildlife in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-371": {"text": "\nSix floods in five years: life in Yorkshire's Calder valley\n, In homes metres away from the river, residents say they are constantly on alert, \nHelen Pidd North of England editor, \n\nFri 21 Feb 2020 09.24 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 21 Feb 2020 11.25 EST\n\n, Kelly Ramsden hardly sleeps a wink when heavy rain is forecast. Last Saturday, when the army was deployed to Yorkshire’s Calder Valley to build flood defences in preparation for Storm Dennis, the 39-year-old was up half the night fretting., She doesn’t have to wait for flood sirens to know if she needs to switch from slippers to wellies. The window of her attic bedroom looks up towards the moors and she can gauge how soggy her kitchen will be by the amount of water rushing down the hillside towards the cobbled alley at the back of her house. From her living room, she can guess whether the River Calder, speeding along just 15 metres away behind a waist-high wall, is going to cause problems downstream in Hebden Bridge or Mytholmroyd., Just over five years ago, Ramsden moved into a early-19th-century stone cottage on Burnley Road in Todmorden. Since then, she has been flooded six times, most recently on 9 February during Storm Ciara, when a month’s worth of rain fell on the valley in 24 hours., Though a caterer by trade, she becomes a full-time flood defender during times of high rainfall. She knows how to wrench the lid off a blocked storm drain (with brute strength and, ideally, a friend). She knows which “floodproof doors” should be done for trade descriptions violations (the useless ones Calderdale council paid for in her house at a cost of several thousand pounds). She knows which switches to flick to keep the lights on upstairs when downstairs is underwater. And she has even become a human beaver, making dams to divert water away from her house with five coffee sacks, five huge rubble sacks and eight sandbags., On Thursday night, Ramsden was out in her sparkly wellies and leopard-print leggings, hair divided into Pippi Longstocking plaits, wondering whether to start building the dam again as rain lashed down. Her house had survived Storm Dennis but what about Storm Ellen, expected at any time?, Next door, Barbara Campion was in despair. “It’s hit me harder, psychologically, this time than before,” sighed the 64-year-old, her ground floor still in disarray 10 days after Ciara flooded 1,200 properties in the Calder Valley. In the living room, her dog, Roxy, scuttled around the bare concrete floor: like everyone in this little row of houses, she gave up on carpets several floods ago., She knew she’d been flooded again on the ninth before she even came downstairs: “You can smell it: damp, stagnant water.” For Campion, who suffers from ME, the stress and cold that comes with flooding causes terrible joint and muscular pain, as well as extreme fatigue., Campion bought the property in July 2017, knowing it had flooded during Boxing Day 2015, along with 3,000 properties across Calderdale. “But I didn’t think it would happen again,” she said. Now she feels stuck: “I don’t know where to go next or how to adapt. I mean, it’s not like you can say: ‘Never mind, I’ll sell up.’ Because you’re not going to get the same money and you’re not going to get anything to replace it.”, The cottages have changed hands in recent years for between £73,000 and £128,000 – cheap for the area but a big financial burden if no one will buy them. “It’s hit me this time just how alone I am. The community is brilliant, and the neighbours, but I feel very alone,” said Campion., Flooding repeatedly is a profoundly depressing experience, said Ramsden. She remembers driving through Mytholmroyd after the Boxing Day floods in 2015 and seeing “grown men crying” as they threw out their belongings. “I’m quite a worrier anyway, so I lose sleep from it. When it rains I am constantly waking up because I can see the drain that blocks from my bedroom, so I am constantly getting up and checking it and moving things up off the floor all the time, moving the dog upstairs. It’s stressful.”, Two doors down, hairdresser Carla Welch was determined to put on a brave face, despite having only three months ago finished renovating her downstairs after the last flood, in July. People keep asking if she regrets buying the house in October 2018. Not at all: “I love living here more after the floods. I know all my neighbours now. I feel very safe here, actually. We all stick together.”, Unlike her neighbours, Welch has flood insurance. The company was quick to install two dehumidifiers soon after Ciara swept through the valley, which have been humming away 24/7 ever since in her kitchen and front room. Her premiums are already £50 a month and she is crossing her fingers she’ll be able to renew., The latest flood has already cost Ramsden dearly. She runs her vegan and vegetarian catering company, Beets and Beans, from her kitchen, which has been out of action for almost two weeks. She supplements that income by working in a basement bar in Hebden Bridge, Nelson’s, which has been closed since Storm Ciara. She has applied for grants: earlier this week, the government said it would fund up to £500 in financial hardship payments for flood-hit households and grants of up to £2,500 for small-to-medium sized businesses that have “suffered severe, uninsurable losses”., Tim Swift, the leader of Calderdale council, said he was sorry to hear of Ramsden and her neighbours’ concerns and would respond as soon as possible.He insisted the council regularly clears drains and gullies, particularly when heavy rain is forecast. “However,” he said, “during periods of intense rain and flood events, gullies can become overwhelmed, as they are not designed for flood water drainage.”He added: “Although the council and dozens of other organisations and communities are doing a massive amount of work to reduce risk and boost resilience, there is only so much we can do to limit damage during major floods, and we always urge individual residents and businesses to do all they can to be prepared and protect themselves and their property.”, Everyone in Calderdale has their own theory of what causes the flooding. Ramsden and her neighbours are sure water runs down faster from the hillside since six new houses were completed above them in the past two years, linked by a Tarmac road. The drains can’t cope, either., Dongria Kondh, the mother of Ramsden’s ex-boyfriend, is certain mismanagement of the moorlands is to blame. She is the coordinator of Treesponsibility, a climate action group that is planting 10,000 trees in the valley and on Thursday began a hunger strike outside Natural England’s Leeds office to demand an investigation into “seemingly unconsented works and moorland burning on a big grouse shooting estate above Hebden Bridge”. The protest seemed to work, and on Friday Natural England said it would be conducting a site visit to the moor next week and would work with Treesponsibility on solutions., Ramsden would like more help. “I knew when I moved to Todmorden it could flood and I’m prepared to manage my house as good as I possibly can. But I need help with the drains and the building behind the house. Even building the little dam I do, I shouldn’t have to do that really,” she said. “But if we chose to live in this valley we need to work with the council and the government. People who live here love it. They don’t want to leave.”dams wellies and sleepless nights yorkshire calder valley flooding", "label": 0}, "train-372": {"text": "\nCoal and wet wood burning: how will restrictions work?\n, Everything you need to know about the phasing out of the polluting domestic fuels in England, \nJonathan Watts, \n\nFri 21 Feb 2020 09.18 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2020 10.04 EST\n\n, From next year, sales of the most polluting domestic fuels, coal and wet wood, will be phased out in England. What will this mean for households, the environment and the traditional roaring open fire?, As the name suggests, this is a type of fuel – usually in the form of undried fuel logs – with a moisture content of at least 20% that is burned in stoves and fireplaces. Also known as green or unseasoned wood, it is cheap and widely available in DIY or garden centres, where it is usually sold in sacks or nets. An estimated 2.5m homes in the UK rely on this or coal for heating., The moisture in the wood is a vector for pollutants that can cause breathing problems, heart ailments and lung cancer. When burned, damp wood produces more smoke than dry logs. This includes tiny particulates known as PM2.5 that are more harmful than bigger flakes of soot because they can penetrate deep into the respiratory system and bloodstream. Government figures show coal and wet wood is responsible for 38% of PM2.5 pollution in the UK, three times as much as road transport., Action is long overdue. Even in London, which has had smoke control areas for more than 60 years, wood burning accounts for up to 31% of PM2.5, according to a study by King’s College. The mayor’s office says almost 8 million residents of the city live in places where this form of air pollution exceeds World Health Organization guidelines by at least 50%. At least a dozen other towns and cities, including Scunthorpe, Manchester, Swansea and Gillingham, have even higher levels of pollution., Not yet. The restrictions are limited and will be phased in over several years. Even after they come into full effect, fire lovers will still be able to collect their own kindling and branches and buy seasoned or kiln-dried logs (as long as they have moisture levels below 20%). This fuel is more expensive, but burns more efficiently and more cleanly, which means more heat, lower flue maintenance costs and fewer health concerns. It is also easier to light and produces a satisfying crackle rather than a sputtering hiss., Yes. This change means some people may have to pay more to heat their homes. Worst affected are likely to be former coalmining communities where sales of relatively cheap local supplies will be prohibited, and low-income residents in the countryside. Even before the ban comes into effect, rural dwellers are already 55% more likely to suffer fuel poverty. The government says this problem is overstated because coal can be replaced by manufactured solid fuels that are more economical and have lower levels of sulphur and other pollutants., These measures will help, but they should only be a start. The block on sales of coal and wet wood will reduce one major source of harmful air pollution, but there are others including cars, trucks, manufacturing and construction. Tighter controls on vehicle and factory emissions will be necessary if the government is serious about reducing cases of childhood asthma and the sometimes fatal long-term heart and lung problems related to PM2.5. A ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars will not be put in place until 2035. The new policy’s effectiveness will also depend on implementation and closing potential loopholes such as the clause that allows bulk purchases (two cubic metres or more) of wet wood as long as it is sold with advice on how to dry it., Very little, at least in the short term when people are likely to switch to dry wood or manufactured smokeless fuels. Looking further ahead, the extra cost of that fuel might encourage more house owners to consider making their homes more energy efficient, which would be help to reduce emissions. UK buildings have one of the worst records in Europe when it comes to retaining heat., Switching to lower-carbon or renewable energy, such as ground-source heat pumps, would make an even bigger difference, but this would require infrastructure investment and incentives from the government to make the alternatives affordable and widely available. If the UK wants to have a double-win on air pollution and climate, another option would be action on transport, including tighter controls on car emissions, more investment in public transit, greater support for electric vehicles and a levy on aviation fuel (which is currently tax-free). Compared with that, the restrictions on domestic coal use and wet wood are a drop in the ocean., • This article was amended on 24 February 2020.

Here’s what some of you said, There are beautiful signs of spring popping up in the grounds of the hospice where I work. It’s hard not to have mixed emotions: it is beautiful, especially bathed in bright winter sunshine, but knowing it’s only early February means we could just as quickly have deep snow next week. The life that’s appearing feels all the more fragile at this time of year and in turn it’s a reminder of the crisis our planet is facing., The photo of flowers above was taken this year on a ‘path of life’ at St Gemma’s hospice in Leeds on 6 February. The path is a place where anyone can come to reflect and remember. The wintry photo is from a similar time last year on 1 February when there was snow on the ground. Looking at the two they look like completely different seasons. In early February last year our gardening team were out clearing snow off the paths, whereas this year there’s barely been a hint of it. Natalie Clince, digital marketing manager, Leeds , With the warmer weather our rhubarb is growing strong – which is a concern if we have frost later. Our rhubarb is organic and has been in the garden since we bought the house over 30 years ago. This year they seem to be appearing incredibly early. The daffodils are just coming up now too. I was in shock at how early they were and how beautiful and vibrant the colours are against the starkness of winter. Clare Howarth, 54, designer, from Manchester, Serra da Estrela is the highest mountain range in mainland Portugal, reaching 1,993 metres above the sea. Back in the late 80s and early 90s it was very common to see snow at this time of year. Lately it is rare a snowfall will last more than a couple of days, except at the top. It’s actually becoming more common to watch the fruit trees blossoming earlier. The above photo was taken on 5 February this year, a very warm day of about 20C, and shows an almond tree in bloom – something that usually happens in early March. The below photo was taken in February 2013 at the same location but showing the surroundings on a snowy day. Isabel Garcia, 35, Portugal, My partner and I are passionate hill walkers, hikers and in general outdoorsy people, so there’s plenty of room to compare. It’s been an incredibly warm winter this year and we’ve barely noticed the snowcaps on the hills in Lomond and Trossachs national park. Last year we were not able to take the road over the hills from Aberfoyle due to ice and snow; today it was completely clear and not a sign of snow. We found these flowers during a walk in February this year around Loch Katrine, near the southern slopes of Primrose Hill. It’s a stark contrast compared to last winter here in Scotland when we went over snow of 10-15 centimetres for many kilometres – bloom was completely out of question. Martynas Virzintas, 39, hospitality manager, from Glasgow , Spring is starting to burst out all over. The snowdrops have appeared and opened fully within a few days which is a little puzzling as they seem to have done so more rapidly than usual. Rather strangely, most of the flowers are coming out at the same time, even though they are normally staggered between late January through until April. Often the UK winter is persistently dull and grey – but not this year. David Seedhouse, author, Wolverly, West Midlands, I am chair of an environment scrutiny commission looking at ways we can reduce our carbon emissions in Southwark. I live in the middle of the city on the river and took the below photo in Southwark park, one of the oldest in London. I have noticed that spring is coming earlier and earlier each year. Snowdrops, prunus, narcissus and iris are not usually fully out but they are in full vigour right now. Blossom does make dreary places look beautiful and at the moment the scents of spring are greeting us before the end of winter. Leanne Werner, Labour councillor in Southwark, London, Mount Fuji is visible most days from the training ring where I work as a horse groom. Locals say that usually at this time of year the whole mountain is white. Last year there was more snow in January and February, whereas this year Fuji-san is only half covered in snow. You can see this from the photo I took on 3 January this year. Even though it was last year, when I arrived in Japan on 21 March, I noticed the sakura (cherry blossom) bloomed four days later when normally this doesn’t happen until April.

It will now be used as the basis to recognise the Himalayan wolf formally as a subspecies, with its own scientific name., This taxonomic recognition will pave the way for the wolf to be given a conservation status by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), to help protect the population., Lead researcher Dr Geraldine Werhahn, of the University of Oxford, said scientists still needed to obtain one final piece of genome data before the wolf could be classified as its own unique species., “Everything is pointing towards it being eligible for full species status but we need to obtain high quality genetic samples, that’s the difficult part,” she said., Werhahn became the first known person to film a Himalayan wolf’s den during four research trips to the Himalayas., The elusive wolf survives on half the oxygen available to mammals at sea level. “It is exhausting being up there, and that is a very strong evolutionary pressure,” said Werhahn, of WildCRU in Oxford’s Department of Zoology., While the Himalayan wolf has hybridised with the grey wolf at lower altitudes, it has endured as a unique species at high altitudes because living there requires such strength. Grey wolves are unable to move in and take over such inhospitable territory., The Himalayan wolf lives in packs of five animals on average – a smaller group than grey wolves – and eats marmots in summer as well as woolly hares and bharal, or Himalayan blue sheep. It prefers wild species but will also take livestock., Werhahn said there was less conflict between Himalayan herders and the wolf than between livestock farmers and grey wolves in Europe, but Himalayan wolves are sometimes killed because of the threat they pose to yaks and other livestock. According to the researchers, local people want to help conserve the wolf and community conservation efforts have proved successful in the Himalayas., Researchers still need to estimate the remaining number of Himalayan wolves. Conservation scientists currently have no idea of the wolf’s population because the animal roams across such a large swath of inaccessible terrain., An IUCN classification “is really the basis that we need to get protection for the wolf”, Werhahn said. “Something without any sort of name is hard to get conservation in place for.”himalayan wolf lopes recognition species oxygen protection", "label": 0}, "train-375": {"text": "\nHouse coal and wet wood to be phased out by 2023 to cut pollution\n, Wood burning stoves and coal fires are the single largest sources of PM2.5, Staff and agencies, \n\nFri 21 Feb 2020 01.10 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2020 10.11 EST\n\n, The sale of the most polluting fuels burned in household stoves and open fires will be phased out in England from next year to clean up the air, the government has said., Plans to phase out the sale of house coal and wet wood have been confirmed as part of efforts to tackle tiny particle pollutants known as PM2.5, which can penetrate deep into lungs and the blood and cause serious health problems., Wood burning stoves and coal fires are the single largest source of PM2.5, contributing three times as much of the pollution as road transport, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said., Sales of two of the most polluting fuels, wet wood and house coal, will be phased out from 2021 to 2023, to give householders and suppliers time to move to cleaner alternatives such as dry wood and manufactured solid fuels., These produce less smoke and pollution, and are cheaper and more efficient to burn, officials said., The environment secretary, George Eustice, said: “Cosy open fires and wood-burning stoves are at the heart of many homes up and down the country, but the use of certain fuels means that they are also the biggest source of the most harmful pollutant that is affecting people in the UK., “By moving towards the use of cleaner fuels such as dry wood we can all play a part in improving the health of millions of people. This is the latest step in delivering on the challenge we set ourselves in our world-leading clean air strategy., “We will continue to be ambitious and innovative in tackling air pollution from all sources as we work towards our goal to halve the harm to human health from air pollution by 2030.”, Sales of all bagged traditional house coal will be phased out by February 2021, and the sale of loose coal direct to customers via approved coal merchants will end by February 2023., Sales of wet wood in units of under two cubic metres will be restricted from February 2021, to allow for existing stocks to be used up., Wet wood sold in larger volumes will need to be sold with advice on how to dry it before burning from this date, the government said., Manufacturers of solid fuels will also need to show they have a very low sulphur content and only emit a small amount of smoke., Prof Stephen Holgate, special adviser on air quality at the Royal College of Physicians, said: “We know that air pollution causes significant health issues across the life course. It is key that the government does everything it can to improve the air we all breathe. Today’s announcement on domestic burning is a welcome step forward, and will in time, play a role in reducing the pollution associated with PM2.5.“Inhaling combustion particles from any source is harmful, but more so than ever when it’s directly within your home. Burning coal for heat and power has to stop and strong guidance is needed to insist that if wood is burnt in approved stoves, it is non-contaminated and dry.”, John Maingay of the British Heart Foundation said: “Wood and coal burning accounts for 40% of harmful levels of background PM2.5 in the UK, and our research has shown that toxic PM2.5 can enter the bloodstream and damage our heart and circulatory system., “Phasing out sales of coal and wet wood is a vital first step towards protecting the nation’s health from toxic air … however, we must not stop there.

One last week, the latter arriving tonight – both named, so all the more like dreaded guests.

The government ordered a review into flood insurance following the storms over Christmas., The study found that about £31bn worth of properties had been built after 2008 on land in England at the highest risk of flooding. The vast majority of these properties are protected by the Thames Barrier in London, it said, although £5bn worth of buildings remain unprotected., Of the 70,000 new homes built in these at-risk areas since 2008, 20,000 are not protected by flood defences. Lincolnshire had the greatest concentration of undefended at-risk homes, according to the report., The thinktank said the government had not done enough to inform new-build homebuyers of their flood risk over the past decade and should step in to help. Helen Jackson, the author of the report, said: “Government policy over the past decade has seen individuals as entirely responsible for finding out their flood risk, but obviously many are simply not aware., “Many of those seeing their communities deal with flooding would view this onus on them as individuals to have understood how flooding could affect them as a bit heartless.”, The National Planning Policy Framework, which guides local planners on the government’s housebuilding policies, states that “inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding should be avoided” by directing development away from areas at highest risk. It adds that where development is necessary, it should be “made safe for its lifetime without increasing flood risk elsewhere”., However, experts say that any housebuilding on high-flood-risk land risks exacerbating the problem elsewhere because it involves paving over green space that would otherwise help soak up rainwater., A government spokesperson said: “Local authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need and have the final say on planning permissions for new developments. However, flooding risk should always be a consideration to ensure building takes place where this risk is lowest., “Where development in a risk area is absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding., “To better understand if some households are not receiving sufficient insurance cover, we have announced an investigation into this issue.”new homes in flood risk areas not covered by insurance scheme", "label": 0}, "train-378": {"text": "\nGreta Thunberg’s mother reveals teenager’s troubled childhood\n, Swedish opera singer Malena Ernman gives emotional account of daughter’s battles with autism and an eating disorder, \nJames Tapper, \n\nSat 22 Feb 2020 17.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2020 04.32 EST\n\n, Greta Thunberg’s extraordinary transformation from a near-mute 11-year-old into the world’s most powerful voice on the climate crisis is revealed today by her mother., In an emotional account, Malena Ernman describes how her daughter came to be diagnosed with autism, and how activism helped her overcome an eating disorder., Ernman writes of the first indications that her elder daughter was unwell in extracts published in the Observer from Our House is on Fire: Scenes of a Family and a Planet in Crisis, a book by the whole Thunberg family., “She was slowly disappearing into some kind of darkness,” Ernman says. “She stopped playing the piano. She stopped laughing. She stopped talking. And she stopped eating.”, Ernman, a celebrated Swedish opera singer, and her husband Svante Thunberg, an actor, struggled to deal with their daughter’s silence and refusal to eat anything except tiny amounts of rice, avocado and gnocchi., She lost 10kg in two months and was on the verge of being admitted to hospital before turning a corner. Yet when Thunberg returned to school, her father realised she was being bullied. “The school isn’t sympathetic,” Ernman writes. “Their understanding of the situation is different. It’s Greta’s own fault, the school thinks.”, After recovering some weight, Thunberg was assessed by psychiatrists and diagnosed with “high-functioning” autism, which Ernman describes as Asperger’s, as well as obsessive compulsive disorder., She went on to become attuned to the climate crisis, with the pivotal moment coming during a film shown in class about rubbish in the oceans, “an island of plastic” in the south Pacific. But after the lesson, while Thunberg was gripped with concern, other pupils enthused about a teacher’s trip to New York and flights to Thailand and Vietnam., “Greta can’t reconcile any of this with any of what she has just seen,” her mother writes. “She saw what the rest of us did not want to see. It was as if she could see our CO2 emissions with her naked eye.”, In the summer of 2018, Thunberg began her first school strike, taking a homemade placard to stand outside the Swedish prime minister’s office., When she was joined by other activists, her father tried to persuade her to go home, aware of the emotional toll it was taking on her. But she refused and the time with other people had an unexpected effect on her., On the third day, a Greenpeace activist offered Greta some vegan Thai noodles. “She takes a little bite. And another. No one reacts to what’s happening. Why would they? … Greta keeps eating.

How can conservationists help?, \nMichael Marshall, \n\nSat 22 Feb 2020 10.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2020 11.12 EST\n\n, At dusk, graduate student Sara Lewis was sitting on her back porch in North Carolina with her dog. “We were supposed to be mowing our grass, but we never did, so we had long grass in our yard,” she recalls. “Suddenly this cloud of sparks rose up out of the grass and started flying around me.”, Each spark was a firefly: a beetle that glows in the dark. Hundreds of fireflies had gathered in Lewis’s back yard and were soaring around her. “It was this incredible spectacle,” says Lewis, “and I just sort of gasped.” Then she became fascinated. “I started wondering what the heck was going on here, what were these bugs doing, what were they talking about?” She has spent much of the past three decades studying fireflies., In recent years Lewis’s work has taken on a new urgency. All around the world, the lights of fireflies are going out. The dazzling beetles are disappearing from long-established habitats. Often it is not clear why, but it seems likely that light pollution and the destruction of habitats are crucial factors. Biologists are racing to understand what is happening to fireflies so we can save them before their lights fade permanently., There have been fireflies since the dinosaur era, says evolutionary geneticist Sarah Lower, an assistant professor of biology at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. “The estimates we have currently are that fireflies are over 100m years old,” she says. Early in their history, they split into two groups, one of which spread throughout the Americas while the other colonised Europe and Asia., Fireflies all belong to a family of beetles called Lampyridae. In Europe they are often called glow-worms, while American fireflies with flashing lights are known as lightning bugs. All these terms are misleading, says Lower. “They are not flies. They are not bugs. They are not worms. They are beetles.”, Fireflies are not the only luminous insects: three other beetle families have luminescent members, as do fungus gnats. However, fireflies are the most prominent. There are approximately 2,000 species., However, fireflies are in trouble. In 2019, the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation published a report on North American fireflies, warning that “populations appear to be in decline”. It was co-authored by Lewis, who is now professor of evolutionary and behavioural ecology at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, and author of a book on fireflies, Silent Sparks: The Wondrous World of Fireflies., The extent of the decrease is unclear because most firefly populations have not been tracked. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which monitors thousands of species, only created its Firefly Specialist Group in 2018. Fireflies are difficult to study: they are hard to find when not displaying., “The best data we have is from the UK,” says Lewis. Citizen scientists have tracked the UK’s one firefly, the common glow-worm, Lampyris noctiluca, since the 1970s. For most species there are only anecdotes, but they all tell the same story, and biologists who study wild fireflies are convinced., Earlier this month, Lewis and her colleagues published the first systematic review of threats to fireflies in the journal BioScience. They surveyed 49 firefly experts from around the world, asking them to rank 11 potential threats in order of importance. “These are people on the ground who have been working with fireflies and they see what’s going on,” says Lewis. According to the experts, the biggest threats to fireflies are habitat loss, pesticides and light pollution…, While some animals adapt to life in human environments such as cities, many fireflies need particular habitats, so are vulnerable if those habitats are destroyed., The congregating fireflies of south-east Asia are an example. The males have flashing lights with which they attract females. They gather at night in a mangrove tree, and flash – whereupon the females fly in and choose mates. In some species the males synchronise their flashes, creating spectacular displays that tourists love., Most such fireflies are in the genus Pteroptyx, and live only around riverbanks. After mating, the females lay their eggs in the mud of the riverbank. The larvae develop there and spend months feeding on snails, before becoming adults and returning to their display trees. “All the parts of their life-cycle depend on that habitat,” says Lewis. But humans are cutting it down and replacing it with oil palm plantations. “For that particular group of fireflies, habitat-loss is a really big thing.”, The second biggest threat, according to the survey, is light pollution. This takes many forms, from bright and direct streetlights to the diffuse “skyglow” that means the sky is never truly dark. Most biodiversity studies have largely neglected light pollution, says Lewis. “But for fireflies it’s front and centre.”, In 2018, Lewis and Avalon Owens of the biology department at Tufts identified five ways in which nocturnal light pollution could affect fireflies, in a study published in Ecology and Evolution. The light can make them lose track of the time or their position. The fireflies may struggle to recognise important objects, such as their snail prey. In species where one sex is attracted to the glow of the other, artificial lights may disrupt mating. Finally, really bright lights may dazzle or even blind the fireflies., Some species are more vulnerable to light pollution. In the eastern US, big dipper fireflies (Photinus pyralis) are thriving. They are not tied to a particular habitat and are common in New York City. “They’re in people’s back yards in Brooklyn,” says Lewis. “The adults fly in parking lots.” However, this reflects big dipper fireflies’ lifestyle. “Their courtship activity is actually just around sunset, so it’s already quite light,” says Lewis. “They don’t seem to be disturbed at all by the high light-levels in urban environments.”, This is unusual. Many fireflies display late at night, when it would naturally be very dark. “If there’s a lot of background illumination from streetlights or even skyglow, then their signals are going to be less visible,” says Lewis. These nocturnal species are most vulnerable to light pollution., Fireflies’ eyes are particularly sensitive to certain kinds of artificial light, says Alan Stewart of the University of Sussex. His team studied the eyes of British common glow-worms, in which males are attracted to glowing females. The males’ eyes were tuned to the females’ green light, but when blue light was added, the males struggled to find the females. This means new LED streetlights, which are longer-lasting and thus environmentally beneficial, are likely to disrupt the fireflies more than old-fashioned sodium streetlights, due to their blueish light., The third major threat is pesticides. This never occurs to most people, says Lewis, because they see fireflies only as displaying adults. “People don’t really think about the life cycle,” she says. Most of a firefly’s life is spent as a larva, on or under the ground, or underwater. There, they are exposed to pesticides. Firefly larvae are especially at risk because they are predators, normally hunting small snails, each of which may contain a dose of pesticide. “If people were aware of that, I think they would be a lot more hesitant to spray pesticides on their lawn,” says Lewis., In parts of Asia, fireflies are taken from the wild in huge numbers. “They have big insect festivals and will hire local people to go out, catch a bunch of fireflies and release them at the festival,” says Lower. If the fireflies are habitat specialists, they will not survive. “That’s depleting populations in some places.” One conservation organisation estimated that over 17m were purchased in China in 2016., Beyond these external factors, there are also risks tied to fireflies’ lifestyles. In a 2019 paper published in Biodiversity and Conservation, Lewis and her colleagues highlighted “numerous risk factors”. For instance, adults often cannot fly far – and in some species may not fly at all – so they struggle to move if their habitat is threatened. Many species also have specialised diets, so can starve if their food supply is lost., The good news is, now we are getting a handle on what is happening to fireflies, we can do something. Some practices, such as the harvesting of fireflies, simply need to stop. Japan has achieved this. In the early 1900s, firefly shops collected the insects, packed them into bags and sent them by bicycle courier to big cities where they were released for people to enjoy. “That put a huge dent in firefly populations,” says Lewis. In the 1920s a young man named Kiichiro Minami figured out how to rear fireflies in captivity, with no scientific training. Minami started releasing the fireflies back into rivers, restoring the population. This is still happening. “Schoolchildren raise fireflies in class and release them into rivers,” says Lewis. While Japan’s fireflies have not been restored to their former glory, they are a conservation success story., Beyond that, Lewis identifies three actions that should help every firefly species. First, she says, “if there’s a place with firefly biodiversity or abundance, try to preserve that habitat.” Not all of us can do that, but one thing anyone who lives near fireflies can do is reduce light pollution. “Turn off your lights during firefly season, or just turn off your lights in general. Have motion-detector lights that only come on when you need them.” And reduce the use of pesticides., People can also help by reporting firefly sightings. Anyone in North America can do so by joining the organisation Firefly Watch, which has been running since 2010. There are similar “citizen science” schemes in many countries. You can also join iNaturalist, which allows you to submit photos of animals for identification., “We just want people to go out and enjoy fireflies in their natural habitats as much as they can,” says Lewis. Stewart agrees, calling fireflies a “magical experience”., With care, many of us may one day have fireflies sparkling in our back yards., The UK has only one native firefly: the common glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca). Lampyris is found also on mainland Europe. They are best seen in June and July evenings, when females glow green to attract males. The UK glow-worm survey website offers a wealth of information., Common glow-worms live for two years. They hatch from eggs in late summer, grow a little by feeding on tiny snails, then hibernate through winter. They spend the next spring and summer growing, hibernate, then pupate in spring. They emerge as adults around June, mate, lay eggs and die. The long life cycle is a vulnerability, says Sussex University’s Alan Stewart: “A lot can happen in two years.”, They are partial to a mixture of woodland and grass or scrub, says conservationist John Tyler, who lives in Buckinghamshire. “The larvae feed on snails and like dense cover; the adults need open space to glow and for the males to find them.”, They are not officially endangered, because they have not been assessed by the IUCN. But there is evidence of decline. In a 2017 study in the journal Lampyrid, Tyler and his colleagues compiled data from 15 English sites and found sharp falls. “Even on nature reserves they’re declining,” he says., Common glow-worms face many of the same threats as other fireflies, but are particularly vulnerable because adult females cannot fly. “They’re extremely bad at colonising new sites, or recolonising sites where they’ve been lost,” says Tyler.why lights going out fireflies conservation pollution", "label": 0}, "train-382": {"text": "\nCan there be a Hollywood ending for the 'Brad Pitt of mountain lions'?\n, Can there be a Hollywood ending for the 'Brad Pitt of mountain lions'?, Penned in by freeways, LA’s big cats face extinction – but a new wildlife crossing might be the answer, by  Patrick Greenfield, \n\nSat 22 Feb 2020 09.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 22 Feb 2020 14.15 EST\n\n, The lingering stench from putrefying deer carcasses is so powerful in Richie King’s pickup truck that his neighbours once reported him to the police. The suspicious plastic boxes behind our seats are empty today, he promises, chuckling, as we drive into California’s Sierra Azul mountains., But we are both hoping the smell of fermenting roadkill proves irresistible for an elusive predator in these hills: mountain lions., King, a wildlife biologist, spends his days setting camera traps at bait sites for the big cats. If they feed on the deer or he finds a kill site, he returns with a cage and collars the mountain lion so it can be tracked by the the Santa Cruz Puma Project, overseen by Prof Chris Wilmers at UC Santa Cruz. Data from this area, surrounded by Silicon Valley, farmland and the Pacific Ocean, is vital to understanding the threats to the species in the region., The Toyota Tacoma grumbles its way through the Californian oaks as we travel to the first bait site. But in a clearing, King suddenly stops and inspects the road. A line of mountain lion paw prints cover the sandy track in the direction of the camera traps. We continue driving, the pickup roaring as we heave over fallen trees. Then, high in the mountain, a dead deer lying on its side and tied to an oak emerges in the shade. Aside from the flies, humming as they feast somewhere inside the animal, nothing else is about., Wildlife biologist Richie King checks a camera trap and, bottom left, mountain lion paw prints. Photographs: Patrick Greenfield/The Guardian, “We use the mountain lion’s natural ecology to trigger our trap. The way that works is we play a distressed sound of a rabbit,” Richie explains, unleashing terrified screams from a speaker to make his point., “If any mountain lion is in the vicinity, they’ll hear this at night time and come to investigate. What he does – what all mountain lions love to do – is grab the deer and drag it off into the bushes,” he adds, detailing how the pulley system tied to the dead animal sends signals to research satellites., There is a serious point to the Puma Project’s research and the work of their counterparts across the state. Mountain lions, known as pumas, cougars, panthers or brown tigers depending on where you are in the western hemisphere, are fabled, secretive carnivores. Feared, persecuted and hunted in every US state where they are found, apart from California, the animal is rarely dangerous to humans and barely seen. Although, as a community in the Simi Hills were reminded in December when a dog was killed, mountain lions do prey on pets., A remote camera captures a mother known to researchers as P-13 and her 10-month-old kittens feeding in Malibu Creek State Park. Photograph: National Park Service, “Let’s see here,” says Richie, flicking through the camera trap footage on his laptop. A grey fox. Us. No mountain lion this time. On to the next site., A 2018 study found that there are 10 genetically distinct subpopulations of mountain lions in the state, with low genetic diversity in areas with high urbanisation and human development. Nowhere is that more apparent than the Los Angeles area., P-22 is a celebrity but he’s not a success story. He’s a poster child for what’s going wrong here with mountain lions, Last year, a study on the genetic diversity of mountain lions in the Santa Monica and Santa Ana mountains concluded that the species is at risk of local extinction in 50 years unless measures are taken to improve genetic diversity. LA’s road network has created genetic islands of mountain lions, driving rampant inbreeding in the big cats. The busy freeways act as barriers and mountain lions are frequently killed by cars on less busy roads. Researchers also fear the road network drives increased violence between males fighting over territory., But all is not lost. There are plans for a 200ft Liberty Canyon wildlife crossing to span the 10-lane 101 freeway out of the city, used by almost 400,000 cars every day. The $85m (£65m) crossing will be the largest in the world when completed, according to conservationists. So far $13.7m has been raised for the project, largely thanks to the celebrity of one cat: Puma-22, AKA P-22 or “the Brad Pitt of mountain lions”., “P-22 is a celebrity but he’s not a success story. He’s also a poster child for what’s going wrong here with mountain lions and in some respects all wildlife,” says Beth Pratt, the California director for the National Wildlife Federation and leader of the #SaveLAsCougars campaign. We are sitting on a bench in Griffith Park admiring LA beneath us, Pratt clutching a lifesize cutout of P-22 as we chat., While famous for the observatory and the Hollywood movie studios that surround it, Griffith Park is also the smallest mountain lion territory ever recorded. Mumbai aside, LA is the only major global city that lives alongside big cats., “LA is known for its infamous freeways. One of the things that’s happening with P-22 and his relatives is they are likely going to go extinct in the Santa Monica mountains and LA area, especially the population south of the 101 freeway. The reason they’re going to go extinct is that they cannot get across these roadways to find mates outside their family so their genetic diversity is collapsing. These guys need to be able to move freely across this landscape,” Pratt says, explaining the importance of the Liberty Canyon project., Were he not a mountain lion, the story of how P-22 became famous in LA would be a cliche. A difficult journey to Hollywood, a sudden rise to stardom and then international fame. The people of LA hear these tales every day. But never about a top carnivore., The image of the mountain lion striding purposefully through Griffith Park in the dead of night, the Hollywood sign beaming in the background, is among the most powerful wildlife photos ever taken. P-22 is still there seven years after his march through the darkness was recorded, feasting on the park’s mule deer, coyotes and racoons., “Once they found out they had a top predator in their big park, that changed everything,” says photographer Steve Winter, recalling the frenzied reaction to his photo of P-22. He spent months trying to get the perfect shot of the mountain lion under the sign for National Geographic. “It brought people a little bit closer to the natural world which they didn’t feel like they were because you’re in the greater LA area.”, Photographer Steve Winter spent months trying to capture this shot of P-22 for National Geographic, Aside from the suspicious mauling of a koala at LA Zoo and an incident in 2015 when he startled maintenance workers checking under a porch near his territory, P-22 has barely been seen in the seven years he has lived in Griffith Park. But that has not stopped him becoming a celebrity. P-22 has made front page news, and even has his own day, 22 October, dedicated to him by decree of LA City council. Not since the Incas built their capital Cusco in the shape of a puma has the animal been so revered., But he is trapped by urbanisation and development, unlikely to reproduce unless he manages to negotiate two major freeways and survive the relentless LA traffic., Much that is known about the mountain lion populations in Santa Monica is thanks to the work of researchers Seth Riley and Jeff Sikich, who have been capturing and tagging the cats since the early 2000s. Both men helped Winter get the famous photograph of P-22. Riley, a wildlife ecologist with the National Park Service, processes the data on lions that biologist Jeff Sikich tracks and captures. Both men know the many of mountain lions they’ve caught inside out, including the problem with inbreeding, which began with P-22’s father, P-1., By telling P-22’s story, we can inject a lot of the conservation messages we want to get out to the public, Riley explains: “P-1 was the first male we followed and P-2 the first female. They mated and had a litter of kittens, P-5, P-6, P-7 and P-8. Three out of four of them were killed by other mountain lions, two of them by their father P-1. We think those conflicts are exacerbated by freeways … but anyway, P6, one of the females from that litter, mated with P-1 and had P-13. So, P-13 was the result of a father and daughter mating.”, It gets worse and is even a story told by the Top Trump cards created by the Cougars of LA, which were sold to help fund the Liberty Canyon wildlife crossing. The card for P-12, who replaced alpha male P-1 as king of the mountains, tells a grim tale in the “cougar fact” section. It reads: “P-12 brought new genes, but his mating options remain limited. He mated with one of his daughters (twice) and granddaughters (twice).”, If P-22’s fame helps Liberty Canyon wildlife pass get built, then the future for the area’s mountain lions could change for the better. Sikich, who still regularly catches the most famous mountain lion in Hollywood to check on his health, understands his symbolic importance., “By telling P-22’s story, we can inject a lot of the conservation messages we want to get out to the public. Being trapped in this little park, we can talk about habitat fragmentation and the need for corridors., One of a litter of four mountain lion kittens found in the Simi Hills by researchers in 2018., “We can use this one individual to tell this bigger story to help conserve this species in this area and in other areas,” he adds., Back in Santa Cruz, King and I are heading to the third and final stop of the day: a kill site he located using tracking data of a mountain lion, 25-F, on the outskirts of Santa Cruz, not far from the beach. We hike up to the unfortunate fawn halfway up the mountain and check the final camera., “Here she is,” King smiles, holding up the video of the mountain lion dragging its kill away.

My last visit here was in December 1990, for one of the memorable adventure experiences that Welsh sea cliffs provide – a 200-metre rock climb, named Fantan B by its pioneers after a pharmaceutical container for antidepressants they’d found in this clifftop hollow. It’s that sort of place., I hadn’t come to climb, just to scan the cliff again for clues to a mystery from that previous encounter. It’s only visible from the sea, or by way of a frightening descent almost to sea level. Scraps of rusting hawser ran through a gap in the quarry wall, the sea shockingly far beneath. Damp grass heeled over in convex plunge, a foamy swell crashing and recoiling in a welter of spray from rocks below. Offshore a seal trod water and peered. Clinging to tussocks, by zigzag sheep paths and a sequence of guano-covered terraces slanting west, I reached a pink ledge. Round the shattered rib beyond was the huge, concave, auk-and-gull-haunted face of Carreg y Llam., Extreme ornithology! It’s one of the great seabird breeding locations, silent and empty as yet but with seasonal restrictions on climbing (few come here for that) already in place. Through a glass I studied lines of huge overhangs hundreds of feet above. Back in 1990 I’d pulled through those, landing on a hidden ledge between them, with the biggest nest – far too large for ravens – I’d ever seen. Sizeable bones were littered all around. There’d been persistent rumours of white-tailed sea eagle sightings around Caernarfon Bay that winter. No eyrie was ever located. This was surely it, but ornithological record requires degrees of proof that put the average murder trial to shame., Back then, twilight coming on, the hardest climbing remained to be done. I’d scurried on, expecting at any moment to be plucked into the air by something resembling Sinbad’s roc. Laughing memory of that panic saw me safely retreat to the slope of horrors in the present day. Maybe sea eagles will be here again soon, inaccessible, safe from human interference.

One man has watched entire sea forests disappear in his lifetime., There are few places in the world where you can dive among giant kelp forests like those that used to flourish along the Tasmanian east coast. , Growing up to 40 metres from the ocean floor, the forests protected a vibrant ecosystem of sponge garden, fur seals, crayfish, weedy sea dragons and countless fish species., Mick Baron, a dive instructor and trained biologist, has watched them disappear., The forests started to die in the north of Tasmania in the 1960s. Baron first noticed them vanishing from Deep Glen Bay, a short boat ride north-east of his dive centre at Eaglehawk Neck, in the late 1990s., The sea along the Tasmanian east coast is a global heating hotspot. Temperatures there have risen at nearly four times the global average. , They are about 2C hotter than a little over a century ago., Warm water pushed down the coast by the east Australian current has stripped the area of nutrients, brought new marine species, and killed more than 95% of the giant kelp. The impact on local ecosystems and fisheries has been severe., “Our whole ocean has effectively shifted to the south,” Baron says., Ocean temperatures vary less than those on land and aquatic species are not adept at adjusting to rapid shifts. In Tasmania, this has been exacerbated by extreme marine heatwaves in three of the past five years., Scientists have linked the heatwaves to rising greenhouse gas emissions., Cayne Layton, a marine ecologist at the University of Tasmania’s institute for marine and Antarctic studies, says the fallout has made the Australian state a “sad poster child” for global climate change., Sea surface warming over time in Australia's southern oceans, This chart shows the annual sea surface temperature anomaly for Australia’s southern regions.

Numbers of once prevalent species have been significantly reduced., The state’s huge abalone industry has been forced to reduce its catch by about 40% since 2016 due to the impact of higher temperatures and over-fishing. Some say a larger reduction is needed to give the abalone population a chance to recover., Crayfish, or rock lobsters, which lived in the kelp forests, have been similarly affected.

In Doncaster, where the Fishlake area was flooded in November, nearly 4,000 homes are intended for such flood zones., The government is facing renewed calls to review its housing strategy as experts, local authorities and insurers warn that building on floodplains is increasing the danger to thousands of people from extreme storms such as Ciara and Dennis, which climate scientists say will become more commonplace., The government aims to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s to help ease a chronic housing shortage across the UK. Yet local authorities say they are struggling to meet these demands because of a dearth of available land, leading to as many as one in 10 new homes being built on high-risk flood sites since 2013., Dr Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said the government’s housing policy was “literally planning for disaster”. He added: “Why are we planning to build more homes in high-risk flood areas when we know that the situation is only going to get worse because of the climate emergency?”, A joint investigation by the Guardian and Greenpeace’s Unearthed news unit found that of the 11,410 new homes planned across seven flood-stricken English authorities, 1,479 are in four of the areas hit hardest by Storms Ciara and Dennis: Calderdale, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcester., In three regions hit by severe flooding before Christmas – Doncaster, Sheffield and Central Lincolnshire – a further 9,931 new homes are to be built on high-risk flood land. The government defines high-risk areas as having a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any year., The data was unearthed by cross-referencing local planning documents and street-level addresses with the government’s national map of flood zones., Building on land prone to flooding is a risk to new homeowners and compounds the danger for surrounding areas, experts have said, as floodwater that could otherwise be soaked up by green space instead runs quickly off concrete and into rivers., In Herefordshire, which experienced unprecedented flooding last week as the River Wye rose to the highest level since 1795, 325 homes are earmarked for high-risk flood zones over the next few years. Some of this land has already been left underwater by Storm Dennis, according to the Herefordshire council leader, David Hitchiner., John Harrington, the council’s cabinet member for infrastructure and transport, described the government’s housing policy as “completely and utterly flawed” and that it was forcing local authorities to approve “idiotic” developments on floodplains so they can meet demands from Whitehall., “Central government just say: ‘There’s a housing target, now go do it.’ It’s really quite stupid. It’s devolving responsibility without giving the authority any power or money to deal with the situation. It is absolutely unacceptable,” he said., Concerns have also been raised that homeowners who buy new properties on at-risk land are in “potential insurance blackspots” as they are not eligible for cover under the government’s Flood Re insurance scheme, potentially leaving them liable for crippling costs in the event of damage., The Association of British Insurers said building on unprotected floodplains was “simply storing up problems for the future” and that stricter checks and sanctions should be introduced to stop developers from finding ways round planning regulations., A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Local authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need, and our planning policy is clear that housing should be located in the areas at least risk of flooding. Where development in a risk area is absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding.”, Scott Cardwell, Doncaster council’s assistant director for economy and development, said the council was only identifying areas in flood zones for housing where they already have planning permission and are “deliverable, viable, and safe”. He added: “They have all complied with national planning policy and the sequential and exceptions tests and have had site-specific flood risk assessments and mitigation agreed in conjunction with the Environment Agency and lead local flood authority.”, In the valley of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, which has been hit by three major floods in eight years, the council’s leader, Tim Swift, said it had removed some sites at high risk of flooding from its local plan after a risk assessment. However, he said that where houses were still proposed for flood-risk sites they would not be developed “until measures have been put in place to ensure that they are safe”., Some council leaders have raised doubts about the efficacy of the measures used by developers to mitigate the flood risk of new homes, such as “sustainable urban drainage systems”. Some have said that paving over absorbent land simply exacerbates the problems downstream., Parr called for government to rethink its housing policy and give more powers to environmental watchdogs “to keep developers in check”., He added: “It’s high time both local and central government started treating the climate emergency as if it was real – because it is., “One of the problems is that by cutting the budgets of both local authorities and the Environment Agency, the government has effectively tilted the playing field in favour of developers. We have a housing policy that tends to put housebuilders’ profits before people’s chances of not seeing their homes underwater.”more than 11000 homes to be built on land at high risk of flooding", "label": 0}, "train-386": {"text": "Malena Ernman on daughter Greta Thunberg: ‘She was slowly disappearing into some kind of darkness’, \nMalena Ernman on daughter Greta Thunberg: ‘She was slowly disappearing into some kind of darkness’\n, A new book by Greta Thunberg’s mother reveals the reality of family life during her daughter’s transformation from bullied teenager to climate icon, by Malena Ernman, \n\nSun 23 Feb 2020 04.20 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 07.32 EDT\n\n, Greta’s father, Svante, and I are what is known in Sweden as “cultural workers” – trained in opera, music and theatre with half a career of work in those fields behind us. When I was pregnant with Greta, and working in Germany, Svante was acting at three different theatres in Sweden simultaneously. I had several years of binding contracts ahead of me at various opera houses all over Europe. With 1,000km between us, we talked over the phone about how we could get our new reality to work., “You’re one of the best in the world at what you do,” Svante said. “And as for me, I am more like a bass player in the Swedish theatre and can very easily be replaced. Not to mention you earn so damned much more than I do.” I protested a little half-heartedly but the choice was made., A few weeks later we were at the premiere for Don Giovanni at the Staatsoper in Berlin and Svante explained his current professional status to Daniel Barenboim and Cecilia Bartoli., “So now I’m a housewife.”, We carried on like that for 12 years. It was arduous but great fun. We spent two months in each city and then moved on. Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Amsterdam, Barcelona. Round and round. We spent the summers in Glyndebourne, Salzburg or Aix-en-Provence. As you do when you’re good at singing opera and other classical music. I rehearsed 20 to 30 hours a week and the rest of the time we spent together., Beata was born three years after Greta and we bought a Volvo V70 so we’d have room for doll’s houses, teddy bears and tricycles. Those were fantastic years. Our life was marvellous., One evening in the autumn of 2014, Svante and I sat slumped on our bathroom floor in Stockholm. It was late, the children were asleep. Everything was starting to fall apart around us. Greta was 11, had just started fifth grade, and was not doing well. She cried at night when she should be sleeping. She cried on her way to school. She cried in her classes and during her breaks, and the teachers called home almost every day. Svante had to run off and bring her home to Moses, our golden retriever. She sat with him for hours, petting him and stroking his fur. She was slowly disappearing into some kind of darkness and little by little, bit by bit, she seemed to stop functioning. She stopped playing the piano. She stopped laughing. She stopped talking. And she stopped eating., We sat there on the hard mosaic floor, knowing exactly what we would do. We would change everything. We would find the way back to Greta, no matter the cost. The situation called for more than words and feelings. A closing of accounts. A clean break., “How are you feeling?” Svante asked. “Do you want to keep going?”, “No.”, “OK. Fuck this. No more,” he said. “We’ll cancel everything. Every last contract,” Svante went on. “Madrid, Zurich, Vienna, Brussels. Everything.”, One Saturday soon afterwards, we decide we’re going to bake buns, all four of us, the whole family, and we’re determined to make this work. It has to. If we can bake our buns as usual, in peace and quiet, Greta will be able to eat them as usual, and then everything will be resolved, fixed. It’s going to be easy as pie. Baking buns is after all our favourite activity. So we bake, dancing around in the kitchen so as to create the most positive, happiest bun-baking party in human history., But once the buns are out of the oven the party stops in its tracks. Greta picks up a bun and sniffs it. She sits there holding it, tries to open her mouth, but… can’t. We see that this isn’t going to work., “Please eat,” Svante and I say in chorus. Calmly, at first. And then more firmly. Then with every ounce of pent-up frustration and powerlessness. Until finally we scream, letting out all our fear and hopelessness. “Eat! You have to eat, don’t you understand? You have to eat now, otherwise you’ll die!”, Then Greta has her first panic attack. She makes a sound we’ve never heard before, ever. She lets out an abysmal howl that lasts for over 40 minutes. We haven’t heard her scream since she was an infant., I cradle her in my arms, and Moses lies alongside her, his moist nose pressed to her head. Greta asks, “Am I going to get well again?”, “Of course you are,” I reply., “When am I going to get well?”, “I don’t know. Soon.”, On a white sheet of paper fixed to the wall we note down everything Greta eats and how long it takes for her to eat it. The amounts are small. And it takes a long time. But the emergency unit at the Stockholm Centre for Eating Disorders says that this method has a good long-term success rate. You write down what you eat meal by meal, then you list everything you can eat, things you wish you could eat and things you want to be able to eat further down the line., It’s a short list. Rice, avocados and gnocchi., School starts in five minutes. But there isn’t going to be any school today. There isn’t going to be any school at all this week. Yesterday Svante and I got another email from the school expressing their “concern” about Greta’s lack of attendance, despite the fact that they were in possession of several letters from both doctors and psychologists explaining her situation., Again, I inform the school office of our situation and they reply with an email saying that they hope Greta will come to school as usual on Monday so “this problem” can be dealt with. But Greta won’t be in school on Monday. Because unless a sudden dramatic change occurs she’s going to be admitted to Sachsska children’s hospital next week., Svante is boiling gnocchi. It is extremely important that the consistency is perfect, otherwise it won’t be eaten. We set a specific number of gnocchi on her plate. It’s a delicate balancing act; if we offer too many our daughter won’t eat anything and if we offer too few she won’t get enough. Whatever she ingests is obviously too little, but every little bite counts and we can’t afford to waste a single one., Then Greta sits there sorting the gnocchi. She turns each one over, presses on them and then does it again. And again. After 20 minutes she starts eating. She licks and sucks and chews: tiny, tiny bites. It takes for ever., “I’m full,” she says suddenly. “I can’t eat any more.”, Svante and I avoid looking at each other. We have to hold back our frustration, because we’ve started to realise that this is the only thing that works. We’ve explored all other tactics. Every other conceivable way. We’ve ordered her sternly. We’ve screamed, laughed, threatened, begged, pleaded, cried and offered every imaginable bribe. But this seems to be what works the best., She devotes the whole Christmas break to telling us about unspeakably awful incidents, Svante goes up to the sheet of paper on the wall and writes:, Lunch: 5 gnocchi. Time: 2 hours and 10 minutes., Not eating can mean many things. The question is what. The question is why. Svante and I look for answers. I spend the evenings reading everything I can find on the internet about anorexia and eating disorders. We’re sure it’s not anorexia. But, we keep hearing that anorexia is a very cunning disorder and will do anything to evade discovery. So we keep that door wide open., I speak endlessly to the children’s psychiatry service (BUP), the healthcare information service, doctors, psychologists and every conceivable acquaintance who may be able to offer the least bit of knowledge or guidance., At Greta’s school there’s a psychologist who is experienced with autism. She talks with both of us on the phone and says that a careful investigation must still be conducted, but in her eyes – and off the record – Greta shows clear signs of being on the autism spectrum. “High-functioning Asperger’s,” she says., Meeting after meeting follows where we repeat our story and explore our options. We talk away while Greta sits silently. She has stopped speaking with anyone except me, Svante and Beata. Everyone really wants to offer all the help they can but it’s as if there’s no help to be had. Not yet, at least. We’re fumbling in the dark., After two months of not eating Greta has lost almost 10kg, which is a lot when you are rather small to begin with. Her body temperature is low and her pulse and blood pressure clearly indicate signs of starvation. She no longer has the energy to take the stairs and her scores on the depression tests she takes are sky high. We explain to our daughter that we have to start preparing ourselves for a stay at the hospital, where it’s possible to get nutrition and food without eating, with tubes and drips., In mid-November there’s a big meeting at BUP. Greta sits silently. As usual. I’m crying. As usual. “If there are no developments after the weekend then we’ll have to admit you to the hospital,” the doctor says., On the stairs down to the lobby Greta turns round. “I want to start eating again.” All three of us burst into tears and we go home and Greta eats a whole green apple. But nothing more will go down. As it turns out, it’s a little harder than you think to just start eating again. We take a few careful, trial steps and it works. We inch forward. She eats tiny amounts of rice, avocado and bananas. We take our time. And we start on sertraline, an antidepressant., Svante and Greta have been at the end-of-term ceremony at school where they tried to make themselves invisible in the corridors and stairwells. When students openly point and laugh at you – even though you’re walking alongside your parent – then things have gone too far. Way too far., At home in the kitchen, Svante explains to me what they’ve just experienced while Greta eats her rice and avocado. I get so angry at what I hear that I could tear down half the street we live on with my bare hands, but our daughter has a different reaction. She’s happy it’s in the open., She devotes the whole Christmas break to telling us about unspeakably awful incidents. It’s like a movie montage featuring every imaginable bullying scenario. Stories about being pushed over in the playground, wrestled to the ground, or lured into strange places, the systematic shunning and the safe space in the girls’ toilets where she sometimes manages to hide and cry before the break monitors force her out into the playground again. For a full year, the stories keep coming. Svante and I inform the school, but the school isn’t sympathetic. Their understanding of the situation is different. It’s Greta’s own fault, the school thinks; several children have said repeatedly that Greta has behaved strangely and spoken too softly and never says hello. The latter they write in an email., They write worse things than that, which is lucky for us, because when we report the school to the Swedish schools inspectorate we’re on a firm footing and there’s no doubt that the inspectorate will rule in our favour., I explain to Greta that she’ll have friends again, later. But her response is always the same. “I don’t want to have a friend. Friends are children and all children are mean.”, Greta’s pulse rate gets stronger and finally the weight curve turns upwards strongly enough for a neuropsychiatric investigation to begin. Our daughter has Asperger’s, high-functioning autism and OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder. “We could formally diagnose her with selective mutism, too, but that often goes away on its own with time,” the doctor tells us. We aren’t surprised. Basically, this was the conclusion we drew several months ago., On the way out, Beata calls to tell us she’s having dinner with a friend, and I feel a sting of guilt. Soon we’ll take care of you too, darling, I promise her in my mind, but first Greta has to get well., Summer is coming, and we walk the whole way home. We almost don’t even need to ration the burning of calories any more., Six months after Greta received her diagnosis, life has levelled out into something that resembles an everyday routine. She has started at a new school. I’ve cleared my calendar and put work on the back burner. But while we’re full up with taking care of Greta, Beata’s having more and more of a tough time. In school everything is ticking along. But at home she falls apart, crashes. She can’t stand being with us at all any more. Everything Svante and I do upsets her and in our company she can lose control. She is clearly is not feeling well., One day near her 11th birthday I find her standing in the living room, hurling DVDs from the bookshelf down the spiral staircase to the kitchen. “You only care about Greta. Never about me. I hate you, Mum. You are the worst bloody mother in the whole world, you bloody fucking bitch,” she screams as Jasper the Penguin hits me on the forehead., It’s autumn 2015 when Beata undergoes an evaluation for various neurodevelopmental disorders. She is diagnosed with ADHD, with elements of Asperger’s, OCD and ODD oppositional defiant disorder. Now that she has the diagnosis it feels like a fresh start for her, an explanation, a redress, a remedy. At school she has marvellous teachers who make everything work. She doesn’t have to do homework. We drop all activities. We avoid anything that may be stressful. And it works. Whatever happens we must never meet anger with anger, because that, pretty much always, does more harm than good. We adapt and we plan, with rigorous routines and rituals. Hour by hour. We try to find habits that work., The fact that our children finally got help was due to a great many factors. In part it was about existing care, proven methods, advice and medication. It was also thanks to our own toil, patience, time and luck that Greta and Beata found their way back on their feet. However, what happened to Greta in particular can’t be explained simply by a psychiatric label. In the end, she simply couldn’t reconcile the contradictions of modern life. Things simply didn’t add up. We, who live in an age of historic abundance, who have access to huge shared resources, can’t afford to help vulnerable people in flight from war and terror – people like you and me, but who have lost everything., In school one day, Greta’s class watches a film about how much rubbish there is in the oceans. An island of plastic, larger than Mexico, is floating around in the South Pacific. Greta cries throughout the film. Her classmates are also clearly moved. Before the lesson is over the teacher announces that on Monday there will be a substitute teaching the class, because she’s going to a wedding over the weekend, in Connecticut, right outside of New York. “Wow, lucky you,” the pupils say. Out in the corridor the trash island off the coast of Chile is already forgotten. New iPhones are taken out of fur-trimmed down jackets, and everyone who has been to New York talks about how great it is, with all those shops, and Barcelona has amazing shopping too, and in Thailand everything is so cheap, and someone is going with her mother to Vietnam over the Easter break, and Greta can’t reconcile any of this with any of what she has just seen., She saw what the rest of us did not want to see. It was as if she could see our CO2 emissions with her naked eye. The invisible, colourless, scentless, soundless abyss that our generation has chosen to ignore. She saw all of it – not literally, of course, but nonetheless she saw the greenhouse gases streaming out of our chimneys, wafting upwards with the winds and transforming the atmosphere into a gigantic, invisible garbage dump., She was the child, we were the emperor. And we were all naked., ‘You celebrities are basically to the environment what anti immigrant politicians are to multicultural society,” Greta says at the breakfast table early in 2016. I guess it’s true. Not just of celebrities, but of the vast majority of people. Everyone wants to be successful, and nothing conveys success and prosperity better than luxury, abundance and travel, travel, travel., Greta scrolls through my Instagram feed. She’s angry. “Name a single celebrity who’s standing up for the climate! Name a single celebrity who is prepared to sacrifice the luxury of flying around the world!”, I was a part of the problem myself. Only recently I had been posting sun-drenched selfies from Japan. One “Good morning from Tokyo” and tens of thousands of “likes” rolled in to my brand-new iPhone. Something started to ache inside of me. Something I’d previously called travel anxiety or fear of flying but which was now taking on another, clearer form. On 6 March 2016 I flew home from a concert in Vienna, and not long after that I decided to stay on the ground for good., A few months later we walked home from the airport shuttle having met Svante and Beata off a flight from Rome.“You just released 2.7 tonnes of CO2,” Greta says to Svante. “And that corresponds to the annual emissions of five people in Senegal.” “I hear what you’re saying,” Svante says, nodding. “I’ll try to stay on the ground from now on, too.”, Greta started planning her school strike over the summer of 2018. Svante has promised to take her to a building supplier’s to buy a scrap piece of wood that she can paint white and make a sign out of. “School Strike for the Climate”, it will say. And although more than anything we want her to drop the whole idea of going on strike from school – we support her. Because we see that she feels good as she draws up her plans – better than she has felt in many years. Better than ever before, in fact., On the morning of 20 August 2018, Greta gets up an hour earlier than on a regular school day. She has her breakfast. Fills a backpack with schoolbooks, a lunchbox, utensils, a water bottle, a cushion and an extra sweater. She has printed out 100 flyers with facts and source references about the climate and sustainability crisis. , She walks her white bicycle out of the garage and rolls off to parliament. Svante cycles a few metres behind her, with her home-made sign under his right arm The weather is rather lovely. The sun is rising behind the old town and there is little chance of rain. The cycle paths and pavements are filled with people on their way to work and school., Outside the prime minister’s office, Greta stops and gets off her bicycle. Svante helps her take a picture before they lock the bicycles. Then she nods an almost invisible goodbye to Dad and, with the sign in her arms, staggers around the corner towards the government block where she stops and leans the sign against the greyish-red granite wall. Sets out her flyers. Settles down., She asks a passerby to take another picture with her phone and posts both pictures on social media. After a few minutes the first sharing on Twitter starts. The political scientist Staffan Lindberg retweets her post. Then come another two retweets. And a few more. The meteorologist Pär Holmgren. The singer-songwriter Stefan Sundström. After that, it accelerates. She has fewer than 20 followers on Instagram and not many more on Twitter. But that’s already changing., Now there is no way back., A documentary film crew shows up. Svante calls and tells her that the newspaper Dagens ETC has been in touch with him and are on their way. Right after that another daily newspaper Aftonbladet shows up and Greta is surprised that everything is moving so fast. Happy and surprised. She wasn’t expecting this., Ivan and Fanny from Greenpeace show up and ask Greta if everything is OK. “Can we help with anything?” they ask. “Do you have a police permit?” Ivan asks. She doesn’t. She didn’t think a permit would be needed. But evidently it is. “I can help you,” Ivan says., Greenpeace is far from alone in offering its support. Everyone wants to do their utmost to help out. But Greta doesn’t need any help. She manages all by herself. She is interviewed by one newspaper after the next. The simple fact that she is talking to strangers without feeling unwell is an unexpected joy for us parents. Everything else is a bonus., The first haters start to attack, and Greta is openly mocked on social media. She is mocked by anonymous troll accounts, by rightwing extremists. And she is mocked by members of parliament. But that’s no surprise., Svante stops by to make sure that everything is OK. He does this a couple of times every day. Greta stands by the wall and there are a dozen people around her. She looks stressed. The journalist from newspaper Dagens Nyheter asks whether it’s OK if they film an interview, and Svante sees out of the corner of his eye that something is wrong. “Wait, let me check,” he says, and takes Greta behind a pillar under the arch. Her whole body is tense. She is breathing heavily, and Svante says that there’s nothing to worry about. “Let’s go home now,” he says. “OK?” Greta shakes her head. She’s crying., “You don’t need to do any of this. Let’s forget about this and get out of here.” But Greta doesn’t want to go home. She stands perfectly still for a few seconds. Breathes. Then she walks around in a little circle and somehow pushes away all that panic and fear that she has been carrying inside her for as long as she can remember. After that she stops, and stares straight ahead. Her breathing is still agitated and tears are running down her cheeks. “No,” she says. “I’m doing this.”, We monitor how Greta is feeling as closely as we can. But we can’t see any signs that she’s feeling anything but good. She sets the alarm clock for 6.15am and she’s happy when she gets out of bed. She’s happy as she cycles off to parliament, and she’s happy when she comes home in the afternoon. During the afternoons she catches up on schoolwork and checks social media. She goes to bed on time, falls asleep right away and sleeps peacefully the whole night long. Eating, on the other hand, is not going well., “There are too many people and I don’t have time. Everyone wants to talk all the time.”, “You have to eat,” Svante says. Greta doesn’t say anything. Food is a sensitive topic. The most difficult one. But on the third day something else happens. Ivan from Greenpeace stops by again. He’s holding a white plastic bag. “Are you hungry, Greta? It’s noodles. Thai,” he says. “Vegan. Would you like some?”, He holds out the bag and Greta leans forward and reaches for the food container. She opens the lid and smells it a few times. Then she takes a little bite. And another. No one reacts to what’s happening. Why would they? Why would it be remarkable for a child to be sitting with a bunch of people eating vegan pad thai? Greta keeps eating. Not just a few bites but almost the whole serving., Greta’s energy is exploding. There doesn’t seem to be any outer limit, and even if we try to hold her back she just keeps going. By herself. , Beata sits with Greta one day in front of parliament. But this is Greta’s thing. Not hers. The sudden fuss over her big sister is not easy to handle. Beata sees that Greta suddenly has 10,000 followers on Instagram, and we all think that’s crazy. But Beata handles it well. Even when her own feed is filled with comments about Greta, and can you tell her this and that. All everyone suddenly cares about is Greta, Greta and Greta. “It’s nuts,” Beata says one afternoon after school. “It’s exactly like Beyoncé and Jay-Z,” she states, with an acerbic emphasis. “Greta is Beyoncé. And I’m Jay-Z.”, We get death threats on social media, excrement through the letter box, and social services report that they have received a great number of complaints against us as Greta’s parents. But at the same time they state in the letter that they “do NOT intend to take any action”. We think of the capital letters as a little love note from an anonymous official. And it warms us., More and more people are keeping Greta company in front of parliament. Children, adults, teachers, retirees. One day an entire class of elementary-school pupils stops and wants to talk, and Greta has to walk away for a bit. Feels mild panic. She steps aside and starts crying. She can’t help it. But after a while she calms herself down and goes back and greets the children. Afterwards she explains that she has a hard time associating with children sometimes because she has had such bad experiences. “I’ve never met a group of children that hasn’t been mean to me. And wherever I’ve been I’ve been bullied because I’m different.”, Several times a day people come up and say that they have stopped flying, parked the car or become vegans thanks to her. To be able to influence so many people in such a short time is bewildering in a good way. The phenomenon keeps growing. Faster and faster by the hour. In the run-up to the end of the strike, Greta is being followed by TV crews from the BBC, German ARD and Danish TV2., Altogether 1,000 children and adults sit with Greta on the last day of the school strike. And media from several different countries report live from Mynttorget Square. She has succeeded. Some say that she alone has done more for the climate than politicians and the mass media have in years. But Greta doesn’t agree. “Nothing has changed,” she says. “The emissions continue to increase and there is no change in sight.”, At three o’clock Svante comes and picks her up and they walk together over to the bicycles outside Rosenbad., “Are you satisfied?” Svante asks., “No,” she says, with her gaze fixed on the bridge back towards the old town. “I’m going to continue.”, The next day is Saturday 8 September. It’s the day before the Swedish parliamentary elections and Greta is going to speak at the People’s Climate March in Stockholm. She has only given one speech before at a small event. Prior to that she’d never spoken in front of more people than fit in a classroom, and on those few occasions she had not exactly seemed at ease., There are a lot of people in the park for the march and the rally. Almost 2,000 have crowded together at the stage and more are on their way. Somehow there’s a different feeling about this protest. It doesn’t feel the same as usual. It feels as if something might happen. Soon. It’s no longer just the familiar faces. The regulars. The activists. The Greenpeace volunteers in polar-bear suits. Here, suddenly, are all conceivable kinds of people and characters. People who might have all sorts of jobs. “This is my first demonstration,” states a well-dressed man in his 40s. “Mine too,” a woman next to him says, with a laugh., The host introduces Greta and she walks slowly but steadily into the middle of the stage. The audience cheers. Svante, on the other hand, is scared out of his wits. What will happen now? Will she start crying? Is she going to run away? He feels like an awful parent for not putting his foot down and saying “No” from the start. All this is starting to feel too big and unreal., But Greta is as calm as can be. She takes the speech out of her pocket and looks out over the sea of people. Then she grasps the microphone and starts speaking. “Hi, my name is Greta,” she says in Swedish. “I am going to speak in English now. And I want you to take out your phones and film what I’m saying. Then you can post it on your social media.”, “My name is Greta Thunberg and I am 15 years old. And I have schoolstriked for the climate for the last three weeks. Yesterday was the last day. But…” She pauses. “We will go on with the school strike. Every Friday, as from now, we will sit outside the Swedish parliament until Sweden is in line with the Paris agreement.” The crowd cheers., Greta continues. “I urge all of you to do the same. Sit outside your parliament or local government, wherever you are, until your country is on a safe pathway to a below-two-degree warming target. Time is much shorter than we think. Failure means disaster.”, Her voice is steady and there are no signs of nervousness. She appears to be at ease up there. She even smiles sometimes., “The changes required are enormous and we must all contribute in every part of our everyday life. Especially us in the rich countries, where no nation is doing nearly enough.” , The audience stands up. Shouting, applauding. The ovation doesn’t stop. And Greta is smiling the most beautiful smile I have ever seen her smile. I’m watching everything from a live stream on my phone in the hallway outside the dressing rooms at the Oscarsteatern.

More than 500 properties were flooded and about 25,000 homes left without power. A week later Storm Dennis followed, which in some areas caused more than a month’s rain to fall within 24 hours., Thousands of people had to be moved from their flooded homes, rivers – including the Wye in Hereford – rose to record levels, while the Environment Agency issued a record number of flood warnings and alerts, including more than 600 last weekend. Four people were killed during Storm Dennis., “We are simply not prepared for the flooding coming our way in future,” said Prof Hannah Cloke, of Reading University. “We need to carry out a complete overhaul of our defences and be prepared to spend a lot more on them over a longer period of time.”, So far the government has committed to spending £4bn over the next five years on improving flood defences. But both the amount and timescale were criticised for being insufficient last week., “Extremely wet days during UK winters are currently up by around 15% compared with previous decades,” said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University’s Cabot Institute for the Environment. “Wetter future winters is a consistent projection with some predicting a 30% to 35% increase in rain by 2070. Our government and town planners need to invest significantly in UK flood defences.”, Last week George Eustice, the environment secretary, said he wanted to see more nature-based solutions, such as the construction of dams made of natural materials and the planting of trees in upper catchment areas. These would hold on to water and prevent it from pouring too quickly into rivers and estuaries., But this approach was dismissed as inadequate by Roger Falconer, professor of water management at Cardiff University. “It is like putting a small sticking plaster on a major open wound to control profuse bleeding. It would certainly be insufficient when dealing with the 30% increase in winter rainfall which the Met Office has predicted for some areas.”, Instead, Falconer called for the construction of a large number of flow-through or perforated dams above towns at high risk of flooding. “Such a dam fills during flooding in the upper parts of the river basin and is then emptied, under controlled conditions, after the flood,” Falconer said. “We need many more of these.”, Engineers and hydrologists also pointed out to modifications made to river channels, flood plains, land cover and drainage, and these often have serious impacts on water flow and bedevil attempts to predict how rivers will react to downpours., For example, one recent study of the River Afan in Wales found 259 barriers had been erected along its course over the past 200 years, although only 33 had been officially recorded. Work on pinpointing barriers like these urgently needs to be carried out, scientists have said., “Blame for flooding under these circumstances is misguided and unhelpful, and politicians should be very careful to ensure they understand the facts of flooding before seeking to champion any particular action,” said Prof David Sear, of Southampton University., Bringing a halt to the construction of houses on flood plains has also emerged as a key issue. One in 10 new homes built in England since 2013 has been built on ground at high risk of flooding, official figures show. Prof Robert Wilby, of the University of Loughborough, told the Guardian that the government should review its housebuilding targets in view of the increased risks from floods., This was backed by Mohammad Heidarzadeh, head of coastal engineering at Brunel University. “The UK’s flood defence systems were developed decades ago and are not fit to address the current climate situation,” he said. “While the interval for major floods was 15 to 20 years in the past century, it has shortened to two to five years in the past decade., “The country needs further investment in its flood systems, but such investment should be within a holistic and integrated framework.”uk flood defence plans inadequate warn scientists", "label": 0}, "train-388": {"text": "\nOil and gas industry rewards US lawmakers who oppose environmental protections – study\n, Companies spent $84m on congressional campaigns in 2018, analysis of votes and political contributions shows, \nEmily Holden in Washington, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 15.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2020 16.25 EST\n\n, The oil and gas industry substantially rewards US legislators with campaign donations when they oppose environmental protections, according to a new analysis of congressional votes and political contributions., Oil and gas companies spent $84m on congressional campaigns in 2018. Researchers found a correlation between an increase in anti-environment votes and an increase in contributions. They documented how lawmakers’ scores from the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) dipped and then were followed by campaign funding from the industry., On average, a 10% decrease in the LCV score in an election cycle was associated with an additional $1,700 in campaign money from the corporations the following cycle., The peer-reviewed study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences., The authors also sought to determine whether campaign donations from industry might prompt legislators to vote against environment rules that oil and gas companies saw as a burden. But they concluded there was little or no relationship between campaign contributions in one election cycle and LCV scores in the following period., “Legislators proved that they’re willing to vote against the environment consistently and then they’re rewarded later,” said co-author Matthew Goldberg, a postdoctoral associate with the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “I suppose this is more of an advantage for oil and gas companies because they need to ensure that people are going to vote in their interest., Goldberg said the findings should encourage people to “get the right people in office, because they’re not as susceptible to money changing their votes”., The study analyzed data from 1990 to 2018. In 1990, 63% of oil and gas money went to Republicans, Goldberg noted.

Because councils often work together on emergency recovery efforts some do not meet the threshold. About 1,400 homes have been flooded as a result of Storm Dennis., “Neither the flooding nor our response is bound by artificial boundaries,” the leaders of seven Worcestershire councils have told Jenrick. “Our response was across Worcestershire and our residents want and need equality of treatment.”, As householders, businesses and council workers consider the scale of damage caused by the latest heavy rains, which saw 15 rivers reach their highest level on record, Downing Street defended Boris Johnson’s absence from flooded areas and rejected the suggestion he had visited flooded areas during December’s election simply to win votes., “The PM was receiving regular updates and working with ministers across government to ensure that people received the help that they need,” a No 10 spokesperson said., The environment minister, George Eustice, told parliament £2.6bn was being invested in flood defences to protect homes. “Climate change is making the UK warmer and wetter with more frequent extreme weather events,” he said., £500 hardship grants will be available for flood-hit households, 100% council tax and business rates relief for at least three months and £2,500 business recovery grants for affected firms. Householders and businesses will also be able to apply for up to £5,000 to help make them more resilient to future flooding., But the leader of Herefordshire county council, where the River Wye rose to its highest level in 200 years, warned that a lack of funds meant roads badly damaged by the flooding are likely to remain unfixed., “We don’t have the money to pay for it,” said David Hitchiner. “They are going to have to be left. Eighty per cent of our spending goes on statutory functions. People in central government need to get their heads on and work this out.”, In Shropshire, where temporary flood barriers in the Ironbridge gorge were placed under severe threat, Shaun Davies, leader of Telford and Wrekin council, said: “It is time the government came forward with a permanent solution looking at the gorge in its entirety. We will absolutely be lobbying the government for that investment.”, In parliament on Monday, Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, where two danger to life flood warnings were in place on Monday and roads, schools and colleges were closed, told Jenrick: “We need more money for our local councils.”, There were also fresh questions on Monday about building on flood plains when a council leader in Durham described a plan by her own council to build a new £50m headquarters on land that flooded last week besides the river Wear as “ludicrous”., “It is madness to want to build anything there,” said Elizabeth Scott, a councillor and chairwoman of the city of Durham parish council, which has opposed the project. “The council will argue it is putting in flood defences, but at what cost to the public purse? The frequency of these incidents is increasing and who knows what the future holds.”, The council insists the building will be erected on a raised plateau and the ground floor will be several metres above the level of flooding during storms Ciara and Dennis. The building incorporates underground tanks, whereby in the event of a major flood they will fill with water and slowly release it back into the river as the flood levels recede., In Herefordshire, Hitchiner, said 325 homes were being planned for construction on flood plains, which he added was wrong but a result of government pressure to meet housing targets. , flood stricken areas england call eased access relief funds", "label": 0}, "train-391": {"text": "\nGreenpeace faces hefty fine after admitting defying court order\n, Environmental group’s lawyers said they knew boarding North Sea rig was in contempt of court, \nSeverin Carrell Scotland editor, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 12.09 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2020 14.56 EST\n\n, Greenpeace faces a heavy fine after admitting that its climate activists boarded a North Sea oil rig in defiance of a court order last year., Transocean, the US-based drilling contractor, has asked the court of session in Edinburgh to impose unlimited fines on Greenpeace UK and consider jailing its executive director, John Sauven, for contempt of court., The legal action is the latest challenge by an oil major following Greenpeace’s decision to switch the focus of its climate campaign to the North Sea oil industry in protest at its role in the climate crisis., In December, Shell won a court ruling banning Greenpeace from occupying four of its rigs in the Brent field after Lady Carmichael, a judge in Edinburgh, ruled that the protest group was breaching Shell’s property rights and risking its activists’ safety. , The Transocean case came after Greenpeace activists climbed on to the Paul B Loyd rig while it was at anchor in the Cromarty Firth north of Inverness in June last year. Greenpeace was protesting at its contract to drill new oil wells in the Vorlich field for BP. , The day after the first group of activists boarded the rig on 9 June, Transocean and BP won an interim interdict, or emergency injunction, banning Greenpeace from occupying it or coming within 500 metres of it while at sea., That first group was removed by police on 13 June. The following day, two more activists occupied the rig for less than 24 hours. After the rig left the Cromarty Firth under tow to the Vorlich field, speedboats from the Greenpeace International protest ship Arctic Sunrise briefly breached the 500-metre exclusion zone around it., Lawyers for Greenpeace UK admitted in the court on Monday that they knew both incidents put the organisation in contempt of court., James Mure QC, for Greenpeace, told Lady Wolffe, the judge, they were justified in defying the court order to raise public awareness of the significant impact that North Sea oil production was having on the climate., With Sauven sitting behind him, Mure said there was scientific consensus that drilling for new oil reserves would breach the Paris agreement on capping carbon emissions, and would accelerate climate heating., Before pleading for leniency and an acceptance that Greenpeace was acting in the public interest, Mure cited statements from BP executives including Bob Dudley, the company’s chairman, admitting that the world faced a climate crisis., Greenpeace was upholding a long tradition of civil disobedience, Mure added. “There are few amongst us who are willing to bear witness to the climate crisis in a more challenging way,” he told the court., Wolffe confirmed she had read Greenpeace’s submissions on the climate science and the Paris agreement, and said: “One just has to have regard to the extraordinary weather events on the continent in the last month or two.”, Despite supporting the first emergency injunction, BP has not joined in with Transocean’s decision to sue Greenpeace for contempt – the environmental campaign group believes that shows BP is anxious to avoid unfavourable publicity., Jonathan Barne QC, acting for Transocean, said his client “does not call into question the sincerity of the beliefs or the motives which led to this action, and the pursuer doesn’t call into question Greenpeace’s right to protest”., But by the time the second group of activists had climbed on the rig, Greenpeace “had made their point and made their point well”., Greenpeace “breached the interdict in the full knowledge it was doing so and Greenpeace wore that breach as a badge of honour”, he added. That was a direct challenge to the authority of the court and a restriction of Transocean’s rights to go about its business, and was inherently dangerous, Barne said., Wolffe said she would announce her decision in court on 23 March.greenpeace faces hefty fine after admitting defying court order", "label": 0}, "train-392": {"text": "\nTell us: is your home built in a high flood risk area?\n, If your home is built in a high flood risk area we’d like to hear from you, \nGuardian community team, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 06.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2020 06.33 EST\n\n, If you live in a home that’s been built on high flood risk area, we’d like to hear about your experience.

It is one of North America’s last remaining long-distance terrestrial migration corridors., And it is at risk. This week conservation groups filed a legal petition challenging the Trump administration’s plan to allow 3,500 new gas wells in south-western Wyoming that would block the route., The petition alleges that the government approved the wells without properly analyzing the potential harm to pronghorn and the greater sage grouse, a chicken-like bird that requires vast, intact landscapes for habitat, from well pads, roads, pipelines and other infrastructure. The frack-field expansion would prevent access to winter ranges that pronghorn need to survive., Migration memory is passed from parent to offspring among ungulates, said the conservationist Linda Baker, the director of the Upper Green River Alliance. “If we cut off their migration route, that memory is lost and not likely to be regained in the life of a pronghorn. This area is a high cold desert, so they survive on sagebrush. If they can’t get to traditional winter ranges on these pathways, they won’t survive.”, The migrating animals belong to the the Sublette herd, which has already declined by 40% in the past decade. About 300 animals from this herd live in a summer range in Grand Teton national park in north-western Wyoming and travel the Path of the Pronghorn to their winter range in the Upper Green River Valley in south-east Wyoming., The northern portion of their route is protected as the nation’s first national pronghorn migration corridor. Oil and gas leasing and development is closed, wildlife overpasses and underpasses have been installed along major roadways, and millions of dollars in wildlife-friendly fencing have replaced barbed wire fences that prevented pronghorn passage., But the southern portion, where the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) permitted Jonah Energy to build the 3,500 new wells, enjoys no such protection. In fact, the migration corridor on this end has already been narrowed by two existing neighboring gasfields., Studies show pronghorn do not deviate from their ancient routes, so blocking access to these  southerly habitats would probably destroy the park’s entire pronghorn herd and further reduce the Sublette pronghorn population. , “We’re very concerned about what this could do for the pronghorn of Grand Teton national park,” said Kelly Fuller, the energy and mining campaign director at Western Watersheds Project. “BLM never analyzed these impacts, even though they knew this could happen. They never analyzed what would happen to the park if it lost its pronghorn, or what would happen to communities that promote pronghorn migration for tourism.”, The BLM is currently reviewing the legal petition, but it told the Guardian that it believed the energy permits complied with rules regulating wildlife and conservation., Unlike birds that have individual stopover locations along migratory routes, entire regional landscapes must be managed in order to conserve ungulate migrations so that animals can find mates, food and seasonal habitats., Conservationists decry the fossil-fuel permits as short-sighted., “If this corridor is destroyed by natural gasfields, the people that come to Grand Teton to see these amazing animals will no longer be able to see them,” said Baker. “It’s just not acceptable to let a beautiful species like this go extinct in one of our most iconic national parks.”pronghorn migration gas wells", "label": 0}, "train-394": {"text": "\nBohai Bay: the Chinese region disappearing inch by inch – in pictures\n, Bohai Bay: the Chinese region disappearing inch by inch – in pictures, Farmland, abandoned seaside resorts and salt fields are slowly being claimed by the rising waters, with 100 million people predicted to be affected in China by 2050, All photographs by Sean Gallagher for the Guardian, \nSean Gallagher, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n, Photograph: Sean Gallagher/The Guardian, Photograph: Sean Gallagher/The Guardian, Photograph: Sean Gallagher/The Guardianbohai bay the chinese region disappearing inch by inch in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-395": {"text": "\nWe have a chance to halt biodiversity loss. The stakes have never been higher\n, Negotiations over a 10-year agenda for nature are about to begin. Our ecological future depends on the engagement of every global citizen, Basile van Havre and Francis Ogwal, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 01.30 EST\n\n, The year 2020 has been designated a “super year for nature”, when the global community will rededicate itself to halting biodiversity loss with a 10-year action agenda, scheduled for agreement at the conference of the parties to the UN Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) in Kunming in China in October., On 13 January we published an initial “zero” draft of an action framework, which will be considered at negotiations being held in Rome from 24 February., This first draft is based on extensive consultations, advice from governments, scientists, indigenous peoples, NGOs and others, gathered through dozens of meetings and hundreds of written submissions., In October this year, hundreds of biodiversity experts and government ministers are expected to descend on the Chinese city of Kunming, Yunnan, to adopt the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. The accord has been touted as the \"Paris agreement\" for nature, aiming to stop and reverse rampant biodiversity loss around the world., Why is it a big deal?In 2017, scientists warned that humans are causing the sixth mass extinction in the Earth's history. Overpopulation and overconsumption are driving a crisis that threatens the future of our species and life-sustaining ecosystems. , Are only governments worried? No. At the 2020 World Economic Forum, business leaders warned biodiversity loss was the third biggest risk to the world in terms of likelihood and severity, ahead of infectious diseases, terror attacks and interstate conflict.  , What might the Kunming agreement look like? In January, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity published a 20-point draft of the agreement. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, introduce controls on invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. Critics, however, say this does not go nearly far enough. , Is this agreement part of a long term plan?Yes. The UN has an overarching plan that humanity should be living in harmony with nature by 2050. The 2030 goals relate to that ambition in five ways: ensure no net losses in the integrity and size of freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems by the end of this decade; reduce the number of species threatened with extinction; enhance genetic diversity; achieve targets of the Paris Agreement, and share the benefits of genetic resources and traditional knowledge. , It was also developed directly in response to the landmark 2019 global assessment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which warned of a million plant and animal species threatened by extinction., Other elements that helped shape this draft include:, A global population of 7.6 billion today, expected to reach 8.6 billion by 2030 and 9.8 billion by 2050, with 68% of us living in urban areas., Recognition of the direct links between climate change and biodiversity loss: we need to address both in order to maintain nature and our wellbeing. We must also be careful not to address climate change in ways that may harm biodiversity and vice versa., To be successful, the new plan needs to engage every element of our societies, going well beyond environmental agencies to whole-government and whole-society approaches., Success will also depend on learning from past experiences, successes and challenges., A fully open and transparent negotiation process is a key characteristic of the CBD: all discussions are open and all drafts are made public. This is a powerful feature and a way to build support and engagement that will be essential at the implementation stage., The proposed framework recognises that action globally, regionally, nationally, and locally is required to transform economic, social and financial systems in order to stabilise biodiversity loss and allow ecosystems to recover. Governments and societies need to determine priorities and allocate financial and other resources, internalise the value of nature, and recognise the cost of inaction. Only then can we achieve the shared vision of “living in harmony with nature by 2050”, agreed by world governments 10 years ago., This plan acknowledges the need to recognise gender equality, women’s empowerment, youth, and the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities. It also recognises that implementation will require the partnership of many organisations – global, national and local, taking a rights-based approach – as well as the principle of intergenerational equity., Achieving our goal requires addressing the five foremost drivers of biodiversity loss: changes in land and sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species., The Rome discussions will be followed by further consultation with scientific and administrative advisers and a second negotiation session in late July in Cali, Colombia, the last meeting before the global community meets in Kunming., The challenge is how we will get to this brighter future from today’s uncertain world. Every government is needed, every organisation, and every citizen. Not only should no one be left behind, everyone should be fully engaged., We need open minds on all sides to a vision of socio-economic development achieved through sustainability, to convince those who can to help those in need, to adjust from an unsustainable paradigm of vested interests to investing in change., There are positive signs from governments, from civil society and from business that the changes needed can be made, as indeed they must.

To the east a blur of lighter cloud stirred the sky, establishing the familiar line of the horizon. As the light grew, the blackbirds’ song, augmented now by those of robins, became more urgent – there was a growing sense that the weather was changing. By the time the sky had lightened to a uniformly grey dome, the birds were braced against the buffeting of the increasingly strong wind as it strained and roared around the branches., Rain followed. Starting as nothing more than a thick mist that caught on the strands of wool along the fence, it escalated quickly. By late morning, the line of hills across the valley had all but disappeared behind the driving rain squalls and the wind was close to gale force. The sound of boughs moving in the surrounding woodland flowed and ebbed in a manner uncannily like broken surf approaching a beach., Sudden, intense bursts of hail seemed to ambush me as I walked down the lane.

Gathering in the copse at the end of the lane, they chattered loudly, if not quite amicably, the noise peaking as several hundred others joined them on the crowded perch., This is a regular stop on their route to the warmer urban roosts of the seafront, and once the whole mass of the flock was assembled, first one group then another rose into the evening sky – with a whirl of plumage followed by a sudden quiet.

Pollution from agriculture fell even further – 4.1m tonnes, or 5.8% – due to the impact on livestock of the historic eastern seaboard drought and north Queensland floods., But fugitive emissions, released during coal and gas extraction, were estimated to have jumped 6% (3.3m tonnes). Pollution from stationary energy – which includes the manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors – was up 2.6% (2.6m tonnes)., The biggest leap was in the surging liquefied natural gas export industry, now worth $50bn after a wave of investment, particularly in Western Australia. LNG emissions were up 16.9% (6.3m tonnes)., As Guardian Australia has reported, the rise in industrial pollution has occurred as the government has allowed big polluters to increase emissions limits under a scheme known as the “safeguard mechanism”, which was promised in 2015 to prevent rises above business-as-usual levels., National emissions across the year were estimated to be 530.8m tonnes, nearly 1% lower than they were in 2000. The government’s 2020 target over that timeframe is a 5% cut., Emissions are down about 1.3% since the Coalition was elected in 2013, but just 0.4% since 2014, the year the national carbon price was repealed and replaced by then prime minister Tony Abbott with the emissions reduction fund. Climate pollution fell about 14% when Labor was in power under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard., The data was released in the wake of the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, recommitting the party to a target of Australia having net zero emissions by 2050. It has not yet explained how it would get there., Every Australian state, the Business Council of Australia and more than 70 countries have supported a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Asked on Monday if the federal government would make the same commitment, the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, said the world had agreed “to get to net zero emissions in the second half the century” under the Paris climate agreement but the Coalition would not adopt a target that was unfunded or not backed by a plan., The government is expected to soon release a “technology investment roadmap”, but has confirmed few details. It has also received a report from a panel led by the businessman Grant King, which was last year asked to advise on new ways to cut emissions. “We’ve got to do our bit, and that’s why we’ll be focusing on technology,” Taylor said on Monday., In a statement on the new emissions data, Taylor emphasised emissions were down 13% since 2005, the year against which Australia’s Paris target for 2030 (a 26-28% cut) is measured., Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the fall in emissions was “little more than a rounding error”, and the government’s policies were “hopelessly inadequate”., “There was no reduction in emissions in the quarter to September 2019 and annual emissions only reduced by a pitiful 0.3%,” he said. “Scott Morrison is failing to protect Australians from the dangerous realities of climate change.”, Taylor said the Australian economy was “steadily decarbonising” but growth in exports was putting upward pressure on emissions. In particular, he said, LNG exports were reducing global emissions “by displacing more emissions-intensive fuels overseas”., Guardian Australia last year asked for the evidence that Australian LNG was displacing coal-fired power in Asia to the extent the government has claimed. It was not made available. A government report at the time suggested gas would be increasingly competing with zero-emissions nuclear and renewable energy in Japan, Australia’s biggest LNG market., Taylor said emissions from export industries had increased 54% since 2005 levels, but per capita pollution and the emissions intensity of the economy – the amount released relative to production – were at the lowest levels in nearly three decades., “The value of our exports has increased by $83bn since September 2013, reflecting the Coalition government’s good economic management,” Taylor said.australia carbon emissions fall industrial pollution surges electricity agriculture lng", "label": 0}, "train-398": {"text": "\nVictoria to introduce container deposit scheme to tackle recycling crisis\n, State trails the rest of the country in offering such a program but it will be part of ‘massive overhaul of recycling industry’, Australian Associated Press, \n\nSun 23 Feb 2020 19.03 EST\n\n, Victoria is set to get a container deposit scheme to tackle its recycling and waste crisis, just months after the state government rejected the idea., It is the only Australian jurisdiction not to offer such a program and has resisted calls by the public, the opposition and the Greens to implement one., The premier, Daniel Andrews, posted to his Facebook account on Monday morning that it would be introduced as part of a “massive overhaul of our state’s recycling industry”., The environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the scheme would be in place by 2023., “This will reduce the amount of plastic and waste that goes to landfill,” she said, also on Facebook. “It will give a second, third and fourth life to beverage containers.

It is also a featherweight, a maximum of 15g, the same as a 50p coin., All British bats are fragile-looking creatures, most often seen by humans on warm summer evenings at dusk, although they are often unnoticed when out hunting. They even emerge in the winter if it is warm enough., Now that bat detectorists know this species of pipistrelle is resident in the UK, sightings are being reported not just in the south-east of England but in Anglesey, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Cornwall., In the summer breeding season males have territories, the successful ones have a harem of up to 10 females, while others manage only two or three., Perhaps the most extraordinary feature is that they migrate across the North Sea.

Both cases remain unsolved., Costa Rica, an eco-tourism hub with five million inhabitants, is widely considered the region’s most equitable and law abiding country., But in recent years, the Bribri and Brörán people have been subject to a string of violent attacks, racist harassment and trumped-up retaliatory lawsuits with almost total impunity. In 2013 Rivera survived a brutal beating while trying to stop illegal loggers. The alleged perpetrator was set free after being ordered not to return to Térraba for six months., As a result, in 2015 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued precautionary measures, calling on Costa Rican authorities to protect the lives and physical integrity of the Bribri and Brörán people. Rivera, Delgado and Ortiz were ostensibly recipients of these safety measures when attacked., Amid growing international condemnation about the impunity, the government has pledged to investigate the growing list of crimes but denies responsibility for the spate of violence. President Carlos Alvarado condemned the murder on Twitter, and confirmed that one man had been detained., “Early warnings about the growing tensions in Térraba were once again met with an ineffective response by the state,” said Vanessa Jiménez, a lawyer with the not-for-profit organization Forest Peoples Programme who works with the indigenous communities. “The government either can’t or won’t protect the Bribri and Brörán from violence.”, Latin America is the most dangerous continent in the world to defend land rights and natural resources, and indigenous communities often bear the brunt of the violence., Costa Rica has eight indigenous ethnic groups totalling 105,00 people who represent approximately 2.4% of the total population. There are 24 legally recognised indigenous territories, which are exclusively for communities with historical ties to the land, according to the 1977 Indigenous Act., But the law has never been implemented., As a result, the Bribri and Brörán people in the Puntarenas province, situated south-east of the capital San José, have taken matters into their own hands in recent years and retaken possession of some land through unauthorized occupations., Despite some success, about 80% of half of the Brörán territory and almost half of Bribri territory remain occupied by non-indigenous families and farmers, who claim that their property and inheritance rights are being violated., Grettel Navas, an indigenous Bröran who works at the Barcelona-based ENVJustice Project documenting environmental and land conflicts around the world, said: “Costa Rica enjoys an international image of a peaceful country, but this peace is not embracing all of us in the same way.

We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakeable. Then we take her milk that’s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.”, Veganism continues to grow in popularity in the UK, with supermarkets clearing shelf space for plant-based ready meals, and meat-free dining in restaurants and pubs now commonplace., Other celebrities who have spoken about the health benefits of plant-based diets are Benedict Cumberbatch, Ellie Goulding and Beyoncé, with their support credited with aiding a rise in veganism’s popularity., Batters said she was not saying “veganism is wrong”, but argued that the debate around animal products had become so binary that meat was being put in the same category as tobacco., “I remember the interview I did with Evan Davis on PM to talk about the government’s new food strategy and he said: ‘Is eating meat the new smoking?’ He compared us with the tobacco industry and you think, ‘Whoa, just think about all of this’.”, But the Vegan Society questioned whether its members were really so influential, pointing out that the total number of vegans in the UK was still only 600,000, and saying: “The fact is 99% of the population are still eating animal products. There might be a lot more meat reducers, but this is not an industry that has been threatened by veganism.”,  Dawn Carr, the director of vegan corporate projects at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), said farmers were not the only ones feeling anxious., “We can’t turn a blind eye to the visible fear and distress shown by animals raised for their flesh, milk and eggs,” she said. “They have no choice, but farmers do: instead of sending sentient animals to slaughter, they can sow oats or soya beans or grow vegetables, grains, nuts or fruits instead, depending on the quality of their land.”, Batters called for kindness to be shown to farmers and an understanding that they were “human” too. “It’s very polarised and it’s doing enormous damage to the mental health of livestock farmers,” she said., “It’s just about instilling this philosophy and being kind and farmers need – we all need – to think that too … in this world of social media, we just need to take a step back sometimes.”celebrities promoting veganism damages farmers mental health says nfu river phoenix", "label": 0}, "train-402": {"text": "\nTell us: Are you affected by rising flood waters on the River Severn?\n, If you live along the River Severn and your home or business has been affected by rising river levels, we’d like to hear from you , \nGuardian community team, \n\nTue 25 Feb 2020 12.43 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2020 06.36 EST\n\n, Water levels on the River Severn are expected to rise further on Wednesday., There are two severe ‘danger to life’ flood warnings in place at Shrewsbury and Ironbridge in Shropshire.

It also cited a renewed focus on “resilience” in the face of natural disasters., A national road maintenance strategy is also newly listed as a high priority, while new priorities include an Indigenous art and cultural facilities program, bolstering mobile telecommunications coverage in regional and remote areas, Sydney-Canberra rail connectivity and an east coast deepwater container port facility., This year’s list drew on 249 submissions to make recommendations for a $58bn infrastructure pipeline of nationally significant projects, each supported by a business case and worth more than $30m a year to the Australian economy. , It also has a list of desired “initiatives”, or potential infrastructure solutions to unsolved problems, which includes strategies to deal with environmental issues., Although the list was made and approved in December, Infrastructure Australia’s chief executive, Romilly Madew, said that the focus on resilience would help “build infrastructure back better” after the summer’s bushfires and floods., “We’re acknowledging that these weather events are having an impact on our infrastructure and it’s really important that everyone take that into account,” she said., Infrastructure Australia listed coastal inundation as a high priority initiative, citing the fact that a flood of up to 1 metre can cause damage of between $60,000 and $80,000 to individual households., Madew said half of Australia’s coastline was vulnerable to rising sea levels, which could have widespread impacts on telecommunications, road, rail, housing and social infrastructure. She cited recent floods in New South Wales, which hit the northern beaches in Sydney and cut off services such as a childcare centre in Stockton, Newcastle., The report suggested protecting against coastal inundation using infrastructure such as seawalls and buffer zones, and noted that a policy response should consider “actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and planning controls for vulnerable areas”., Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning, Infrastructure Australia listed both town and city water security and a national water strategy as high priority initiatives, citing possible “severe urban water shortages or restrictions” and regional towns reliant on a single supply source as causes for concern., Madew said that water was a nationally significant issue in part because of “compounding factors” such as drought, but Infrastructure Australia wanted a national plan “to keep it on people’s radar” so resilience was improved for the next drought., Infrastructure Australia also called for a national waste and recycling management strategy to boost Australia’s recycling rate from its current 55% to the target of 70% set out in the 2014-21 waste avoidance and resource recovery strategy., Regional Australia also emerged as a focus of this edition of the infrastructure priority list, with a call to improve mobile telecommunications coverage in remote areas and improve regional road safety., “Staying connected requires not only safe and efficient transport options, but also ensuring our towns and regional communities have the same access to telecommunications as the rest of Australia,” Madew said., “This is to also provide people with reliable access to electronic payment systems, emergency alerts, technology innovations and other critical services.”, Other high priority initiatives that remain on the list from previous years include preservation of a corridor for proposed east coast high speed rail, better connections to improve reliability in the national electricity market, more remote housing and a national electric vehicle fast-charging network., Infrastructure Australia listed an Indigenous art and cultural facilities program as a priority in the category of “social infrastructure”, noting the high demand for domestic and international cultural tourism and the role of arts and culture in the economic empowerment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples., Other newly listed priority initiatives were:, In NSW: the John Hunter health and innovation precinct; Great Western highway improvements between Katoomba and Lithgow; Princes Highway upgrade from Nowra to the Victorian border; and South Creek integrated land use and water cycle management, In Victoria: Cycling access to Melbourne CBD; and Frankston public transport connectivity, In Queensland: national land transport network maintenance, a high priority; and the inland road network upgrade, In Western Australia: regional and rural road network improvements and Perth water security, both high priorities; Great Northern Highway improvements from Broome to Kununurra; Wheatbelt secondary freight network improvements; South Coast Highway improvements from Albany to Esperance; South West Interconnected Systems transformation; a liquefied natural gas research facility; and Port Hedland port capacity., Madew said it became “really clear in the bushfires that the Princes Highway’s connectivity is crucially important” and it had been “constrained” as residents sought to evacuate the NSW south coast., The same would apply to the proposed upgrade of the Great Western highway, she said, which was crucially important for evacuations but had been blocked on and off for weeks due to fires., Madew has been appointed to the expert advisory panel for the Csiro’s review on climate and disaster resilience, lead by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel.environmental concerns get top billing in infrastructure australia priority list for first time", "label": 0}, "train-404": {"text": "\nAre you taking part in the youth climate protest in Bristol?\n, We’d like to hear from those who’re hoping to join Greta Thunberg at the youth climate strike in Bristol on Friday , \nGuardian community team, \n\nTue 25 Feb 2020 11.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 27 Feb 2020 06.37 EST\n\n, Greta Thunberg will take part in a youth climate protest in Bristol.

The research, led by the University of York, shows king scallop density is four times higher than in 2013, carbon-absorbing weeds have returned to the seabed, and the area is now a nursery for juvenile fish, especially cod. The lobsters in the zone produce six times more eggs than outside it., “The seabed habitats are springing up,” says Howard Wood, co-founder of the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (Coast). “Without destructive forms of fishing, this amazing, complex seabed allows more species to inhabit, hide and feed. You can see what happens when nature is allowed to thrive.”, Wood, a diver who was awarded an OBE for services to the environment, led the successful lobbying for no-take zones along with fellow local resident Don MacNeish, who witnessed their transformative effect in New Zealand. Now they are calling for Holyrood and Westminster to sanction more no-take zones around the UK., Any environment can benefit from better protection, and every community has the right to a better environment if they want one, In contrast to humans, who become less fertile as they grow older, many species of fish spend more of their energy producing eggs as they age. This is one reason proponents say no-take zones – also known as highly protected marine areas (HPMAs) – are so crucial to allowing species repopulation., There are currently four such zones in the UK: in the Medway estuary, at Flamborough Head on the north Yorkshire coast, and near Lundy island, Devon – which has seen a remarkable rise in the lobster population., The UK government is currently examining whether to introduce no-take zones in vulnerable English sea areas, with a review due to be published this spring. There are already about 350 marine protection areas, but as they allow fishing, many observers think they do little to improve degraded ecosystems., “We have thousands of square kilometres of ‘paper parks’, which give the appearance of protection but do little in practice,” says Jean-Luc Solandt of the Marine Conservation Society. “It is the unfortunate case that the government is doing very little to protect our seas.”, Trawling, for instance, is banned in MPAs, but there are many reports that this is not effectively enforced. “People are fishing with impunity and we find it flabbergasting that the protected areas are not actually protected,” says Solandt., Last month, marine conservation charity Open Seas accused the Scottish government of “sitting on its hands in the wake of repeated instances of illegal scallop dredging” in MPA’s., More than 98% of British scallops – the majority of which are exported to Europe – are caught using dredges that unearth the molluscs from the seabed; smashing sea urchins, tearing limbs off starfish and often leaving a trail of collateral damage, though the proportion caught in protected areas is unclear. , But the £120m sector employs about 600 people directly, and another 750 in processing jobs, meaning any further changes would inevitably put some people out of work., A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs blamed the EU for the failures in marine conservation. “Currently the Common Fisheries Policy restricts our ability to implement tougher protections but leaving the EU and taking back control of our waters as an independent coastal state gives us the opportunity to introduce stronger measures,” she says., “Targeted HPMAs could complement the existing network of MPAs and allow vulnerable marine wildlife to fully recover, free from all damaging human activities, with the aim of leaving nature in a better state than we found it.”, In New Zealand, Australia, the US and elsewhere, large parts of the sea are subject to comprehensive fishing bans., Such zones should be expanded to at least one-quarter of all UK waters, say conservationists. This would allow stocks of fish such as North Sea cod – which have fallen by almost a third since 2015 – to replenish., The National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations argued that no-take zones were not needed, as current protections were sufficient. “Contrary to claims that they are ‘paper parks’, once steps have been completed to put in place appropriate management, there is little doubt that MPAs will provide ample levels of protection,” assistant chief executive Dale Rodmell says., He says it will not matter how many crabs and lobsters live in the sea if coastal communities cannot make a living from them., But it is precisely the interests of the community that Wood has in mind. “Coast’s most important message is that any environment can benefit from better protection, and every community has the right to a better environment if they want one,” he says., “If that is embraced on a global scale then we truly will see a sea change in the health of our seas.”how no take zones revived one devastated scottish fishery isle of arran", "label": 0}, "train-406": {"text": "The end of farming?, \nThe end of farming?\n, For decades, the way we farm has been degrading land and destroying wildlife. Now there’s a revolution coming – but is it going to create more problems than it solves? By  Christopher de Bellaigue, \n\nTue 25 Feb 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 13 Mar 2020 08.00 EDT\n\n, In the last years of the 20th century, Glenfeshie, a 17,000-hectare estate in the Scottish Highlands, was in steep decline. Decades of overgrazing by deer had reduced its hillsides to clipped lifelessness. Denied the protection afforded by tree roots, the banks of the River Feshie were losing soil each time it flooded, the water depositing silt downstream. Those few Scots pines that had survived the browsing of the deer were nearing the end of their lives; soon there would be no seed source for the next generation., Between 1997 and 2006, ownership of Glenfeshie passed between three Danish businessmen – and with it a self-destructive business model. Only by maintaining very high numbers of livestock could the flow of fee-paying deerstalkers armed with rifles be ensured, but because of the rising cost of gamekeepers and estate upkeep, Glenfeshie’s sporting operations were still making a loss. All the while, the pine martens, mountain hares and hen harriers for which the Highlands are a natural habitat were being crowded out by the deer on which the model depended., In 2006, the billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, the last and richest of the three Danes, whose fashion empire includes the online retail giant Asos, bought Glenfeshie. Urged on by his man on the ground, a former land agent called Thomas MacDonell, he intensified efforts that had started under his predecessor to bring down deer numbers, with a view to allowing the estate’s woodland to recover and biodiversity to return., Glenfeshie is the biggest of the 12 Scottish estates that Povlsen and his wife Anne began acquiring and rewilding in 1996 – in the process spending a total of £70m and becoming the country’s largest private landowners. Although the term “rewilding” – meaning an approach to conservation that allows nature a free rein – has been in currency since 1990, many traditional landowners and gamekeepers continue to spurn both the term and the idea behind it. In the Highlands, rewilding implies that the concept of the country estate as a setting for people of quality to shoot game has had its time. Never very profitable – the Highlands were where rich people came to spend money they had made elsewhere – in recent decades, the sporting estates have become still less viable. As one veteran gamekeeper told me, very few of them actually make money., By 2013, MacDonell and his team had culled 8,000 deer at Glenfeshie, and his local opponents, among them a neighbouring deerstalking enterprise, had camped on the moral high ground. “When they shoot deer they call it sport,” MacDonell said wryly when I visited him last September, “and when we shoot deer they call it slaughter. Also, they claimed it would take hundreds of years for the woodland to regenerate.”, We were standing on a track overlooking the River Feshie. On either side, young Scots pines displayed bright green needles against the glowing heather. Among the pines grew rowans hung with scarlet berries, and bilberry bushes whose leaves would be fair game for white moth caterpillars in spring. There were more new trees on the far side of the Feshie, binding the banks and spreading up the hillside. MacDonell smiled. “As you can see, our opponents were wrong.”, Over the past 20 years or so, from South America to the Danube basin, ad hoc coalitions of politicians, activists and conscience-stricken billionaires (whose core activities, such as Povlsen’s clothing business, are often less than environmentally friendly), have rewilded millions of acres of mostly failed agricultural and grazing land. Their guiding philosophy – that we should leave the land alone – upends the long dominant view that land should be cleared, ploughed and wrung ever more efficiently for food., Because many of the practitioners are billionaires, and because the landscapes they have returned to nature are (no matter who owns them on paper) our cherished inheritance, and because of a deeply held tradition of depending on the land for food, rewilding attracts controversy. But it is based on a longer view of the planet’s health, which dictates that we use the land not only to feed ourselves in a more environmentally sustainable way, but also to capture greenhouse gases, save endangered species and offer ourselves an occasional break from traffic and hand-sanitisers – that is, to leave town and enjoy the works of nature., The regeneration of Glenfeshie is such a work. Across the hills that divide the Feshie’s catchment from that of the neighbouring river, the Tromie, MacDonell and his team have planted hundreds of thousands of pines, birches, willows and other native trees over the past decade. A few years from now, these stems will develop into a barrier against erosion, a carbon sink and a habitat for distinctive Highland birds such as the capercaillie and ptarmigan. Birds and the wind distribute seeds, while the estate’s deer, whose concentration has been brought down from 40 per sq km to one, are no longer numerous enough to eat all the young shoots. The increased vegetation also provides food for the pine martens, red squirrels and mountain hares that MacDonell is seeing in rising numbers, while the population of endangered birds such as crossbills and crested tits has also risen., For whose benefit? The Povlsens’ Scottish operations currently make an annual loss of £3m, but it is hoped that they will turn a profit by 2027, thanks to clients paying to stay in luxurious accommodation, enjoy exquisitely underdone venison and wander the restored landscapes. When rewilding plans were first revealed, critics of Scotland’s concentrated land ownership – half of the Scottish countryside is owned by around 450 people – expressed fears that Glenfeshie might become a reservation for the rich, but these have been partially allayed by letting ordinary hikers walk across the glens for free., If rewilding seems like a rich person’s indulgence, this is because its economic viability is unproven. It is also a misnomer, for whether by getting rid of tens of thousands of sheep in Patagonia or introducing a living species as a surrogate for an extinct one – Sayaguesa cattle in place of aurochs in Croatia’s Velebit Mountains, for instance – rewilding requires more human intervention than its name suggests. The tourism it offers is limited; a rewilded area cannot accommodate many people without undermining its own existence. By diverting investment towards repairing landscapes and contributing to the public weal, rewilders are taking money away from conventional economic activities. And this is where its impact will be felt in British farming. Barely a decade ago, the notion that land should be managed in order to ensure planetary wellbeing had few takers among farmers whose raison d’etre was to fill human bellies at the lowest possible cost. But this is the proposition that is now poised to determine the future of farming., Farmers account for just 1.5% of the British population, but the size of their domain – 71% of the country’s surface area is classified as farmland – has given them power over the public imagination, reinforced by children’s books depicting resourceful hens and humorous porkers. Over time, this image of Britain – green, giving and blossomy, an Eden to which city-dwellers joyfully flee in moments of leisure – came to inform the country’s view of itself., Memories of resilience in adversity were inevitably a factor in the growth of intensive farming. When the country was blockaded during the second world war and the nation’s farmers were told to convert scrub and pasture to sown fields, arable land doubled. In peacetime, the patriotic drive for self-sufficiency continued, as the population soared and farmers cleared more land in order to produce more food. Between 1946 and 1963, an average of 3,000 miles of hedgerows were stripped out each year., After Britain joined the European Community in 1973, its farmers received subsidies that rewarded production and – when that led to wasteful surpluses – simply for holding farmland. In 2017, some £2.73bn was disbursed in this way. For decades, farmers justified their subsidies by citing the continuing need for British self-sufficiency in food production, despite the fact that in many cases they were only solvent thanks to European subsidies. During that time, there was still only minimal awareness that the relentless drive for higher yields through intensive methods might be bad for the environment. The few farmers who questioned the prevailing wisdom faced ostracism by their peers., So Charles Burrell discovered in 2000, when he declared defeat after a decade and a half of intensive farming at Knepp, his 1,400-hectare estate in the south of England. Burrell had invested in automatic feeding systems, state-of-the-art combine harvesters and gallons of fertilisers and pesticides in order to coax more milk from his cows and higher yields from the stodgy Sussex clay. But for 13 of his 15 years in charge, Burrell sank more money into the farm than he received in revenues, and the estate was £1.5m overdrawn. In February 2000, he told his employees that he was coming out of farming., “The farm workers … left the office grimly shaking their heads,” his wife, Isabella Tree, recalled in Wilding, the book she wrote about the couple’s experiences. But if liquidation was shocking, Burrell’s decision to seek public money to turn his farm into a “biodiverse wilderness”, and his aim to turn a profit through tourism and organic meat, seemed downright perverse., In 2001, starting with a small section of the estate and gradually expanding as funding became available, Burrell stopped ploughing the land and spraying it with chemicals. Removing internal fences allowed the wild Exmoor ponies and Tamworth pigs he introduced to browse and rootle over large distances, their disruptions creating habitats for other animals and plants. Dung beetles dived into delicious organic cowpats left by longhorn cattle that hadn’t been fed wormers and parasiticides; voles colonised the roots of a dead oak that under the previous regime would have been felled in the interests of tidiness. The summer of 2002 revealed wildflowers with delightful names such as bird’s-foot trefoil and lady’s bedstraw that hadn’t been seen in such numbers for a generation, along with a profusion of insects, which produced a continuous thrum – “something”, in Tree’s words, “we hadn’t even known we’d been missing”., Much bigger and more ambitious rewilding schemes than Knepp are currently underway across Europe. But whatever the challenges that face international conservationists who are restoring the largely abandoned Coa Valley of northern Portugal, or those at work in Swedish Lapland (population: 1,000), mass hostility from the locals isn’t one of them. Rewilding in the densely populated Sussex Weald was a tougher sell., In August 2003, Burrell invited local farmers to Knepp with the aim of converting them to the project. As he laid out his vision of fields and hedges devolving into scrub and wetland, his audience erupted with anger. “It wasn’t simply that our neighbours (including some other members of the family) thought this wasn’t right for them,” Tree wrote. “It was more visceral … an affront to the efforts of every self-respecting farmer, an immoral waste of land, an assault on Britishness itself.”, By 2008, Knepp was suffused by weeds such as ragwort, whose vivid yellow flowers are great for pollinators but can kill livestock in the rare event that they are eaten in large amounts. In a letter to the West Sussex County Times, a critic resorted to doggerel to denounce Knepp’s “ragwort shame, spread like the plague, and who’s to blame?”, When I visited Knepp after heavy rain last autumn, what had been arable fields were a sodden mishmash of young trees, billowing hedges and fleabane stalks, naturally occurring growths that have enhanced Knepp’s capacity for carbon capture. In 2011, Burrell had deliberately collapsed the banks of the River Adur where it runs through his property in order to create the kind of accommodating plain that floods harmlessly after heavy rain., Burrell’s flood-plain and the ramblers’ paths that criss-cross the estate constitute what the government defines as “public goods”: services provided to society without material profit. They have helped quiet much of the local opposition to Knepp’s rewilding. Meanwhile, wildlife tourism has turned Knepp into a successful business that employs more people than it did when it was a farm. Springtime overnighters snuggling down in a luxury treehouse after a soak in the open-air, wood-fired Swedish Hikki bathtub may hear nightingales serenading their consorts; they can take home organic Knepp chops to remember the free-running Tamworths by. Tree’s book Wilding has sold so well that its author recently appeared on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs, an indication of impending national treasure status., Burrell is nowadays asked about his methods by farmers from around the country. But Knepp is not easy to emulate; its success lies partly in its rarity and its aristocratic charm – Burrell is a baronet who lives in a rinky-dink castle. Nor are the farmers who consult him necessarily converts to rewilding. As Burrell himself says: “These guys may not like it, but they don’t know what the future holds and are being forced to engage.”, At present, in addition to the EU subsidy they receive for holding agricultural land, farmers who provide public goods, such as fostering wildflowers and mitigating flood risk, can claim EU environmental subsidies. But take-up has been patchy; between 2014 and 2017, environmental disbursals fell from £489m to £399m, a reflection of what farmers call the government’s overly prescriptive approach., The brutal fact is that government policy is about to get a lot more prescriptive. With Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the government is scrapping the subsidy system which has kept British farming in stasis for years – and on which the livelihoods of many thousands depend. Under the agriculture bill currently before parliament, subsidies will be redirected at public goods alone. If a farmer does not provide such services, they will have to live off sales of their produce. This may not be a problem for the UK’s bigger farming companies, but impossible for many of the smaller family-owned enterprises whose annual subsidy is currently all that keeps them from insolvency., Hence the queue of worried farmers outside Burrell’s door. Knepp may hold the secret to rehabilitating the tarnished name of British farming. The more candid of the country’s farmers admit that they have suffered a calamitous fall in public esteem. From being the devoted fillers of the nation’s larders and the custodians of rural heritage, farmers, as one lamented to me, are increasingly seen as people who “take public money while raping the land”., Intensive arable farming is designed to raise yields and eliminate pests and disease. The more fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are used, the bigger the harvests. Back in the chemical-free, weed-infested 1940s, Charles Burrell’s great-grandfather was lucky if he got two tonnes of wheat per hectare. Nowadays, farmers using high-yielding varieties would expect to harvest 10 tonnes of wheat per hectare, usually after applying pesticides, ammonium nitrate fertiliser, and a sprinkling of Roundup – a weedkiller found to have caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma among farmers. Overlooking their carcinogenic properties, the right chemicals – and the right weather – bring amazing results. In 2015, a farmer from Northumberland posted a yield of 16.52 tonnes per hectare, winning him a place in the Guinness Book of Records., For all the role that chemicals have played in improving yields, creating a loyal customer base among many of Britain’s 17,000-odd farms, there is a growing appreciation of the long-term environmental damage they cause. With repeated application over several years, chemicals kill the tiny mycorrhizal fungi that supply roots with water and nutrients, as well as earthworms that provide aeration and improve drainage., Overuse of these chemicals, along with the mania for stripping out hedgerows and scrub that provide food and shelter for many animals, has led to a calamitous loss of wildlife. More than 40% of species in Britain have been declining since 1970, while one in every seven of its wildlife species faces extinction, a much worse record than the world average., Then there is the contribution that farming makes to climate change. British agriculture is responsible for 10% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through methane from cows and sheep, nitrous oxides that are produced by fertilisers, and CO2 that comes off the land when carbon-rich organic matter in the soil oxidises during ploughing., Guided by Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist who advises the government on farming policy, the political establishment has become decidedly sceptical of the old benign image of British farming. Last year, Helm called for the “full scale of the disaster of British agriculture” to be recognised, adding that “no other economic activity combines such a perverse set of incentives, or produces so little value for its true costs”., Even sheep-farming, celebrated by William Wordsworth as a symbol of rural plenitude, is nowadays described as an ecological disaster by writers and activists such as George Monbiot, who argues that the only hope for Britain’s “sheep-wrecked” hills is to reforest them and get rid of ruminants altogether., Converts to the new scepticism include Michael Gove, who, as environment secretary in Theresa May’s government, had a big hand in drafting the agriculture bill currently being scrutinised by MPs. Even the National Farmers Union has committed its members to going carbon-neutral by 2040 – though that goal may only be attainable through as yet undeveloped carbon capture technologies., The agriculture bill sits snugly alongside the government’s environment bill, another Gove baby, which had its first parliamentary reading in January and will enshrine the so-called “polluter pays” principle, according to which dirty industries are penalised at source. No longer can farmers who use chemicals that run into rivers expect water companies and the fishing industry to pick up the bill. Instead, the use of chemicals will be priced according to the greenhouse gases that are emitted while making them and the cost of clearing up the mess they cause – though the vexed question of exactly how the costs will be spread has yet to be resolved., The change that is coming over farming can be summarised in simple economic terms. Intensive agriculture prioritises a bumper harvest – the annual dividend – while the new approach emphasises the preservation of the initial capital – the land itself. For a glimpse of how this new investment priority will affect British farming, it suffices to visit those progressives who have already, to varying degrees, made it their own., One afternoon last September, John and Paul Cherry invited me on to their Hertfordshire farm to show how to regenerate damaged soil. Until 10 years ago, each autumn the brothers would laboriously turn over lifeless slabs of clay, which needed to be pulverised with a power harrow before sowing could begin. Then they would douse the land with chemicals to coax forth an unwilling wheat crop. “It was as if we were in a battle with nature,” Paul said., In the 1990s, following innovators in the US midwest, a handful of British farmers went organic or stopped ploughing the soil to make a seed bed (so-called “no-tillers”). In 2010, the Cherrys followed suit, planting cover crops such as clover to reduce soil erosion and lock in carbon over the winter, and cutting their use of chemicals. “That brought us much closer to what nature would have us do,” said John as he poured some crumbling, friable soil reverentially into my hand, pausing to point out some “lovely” wormholes. “It’s a miniature rainforest,” he went on, “with more living things in it than there are people on the planet, full of bacteria and protozoa that are feasting off each other and interacting with the roots of the plant.”, After hearing about soil health from the Cherrys, I travelled north to the Fens, about 400,000 hectares of low-lying coastal plain in the east of England, which produces more than 7% of the country’s agricultural produce on less than 4% of its agricultural land. This flat, largely treeless landscape, much of which was reclaimed from the sea in the 18th and 19th centuries and is now protected by a stupendous system of dykes, cuts, drains and washes, is home to a farmer named Tom Clarke., Standing on black, peaty ground in the shadow of Ely Cathedral, Clarke pointed out his neighbour’s field, which had been ploughed and was bare up to the dyke that divides the two properties. Clarke’s side, by contrast, featured a 10-metre margin of fodder radishes and wildflowers, a combination that provides pollen for bees and seeds for the grey partridges and corn buntings whose food sources have been depleted by intensive farming. When Clarke was a child, his father farmed the same land using intensive methods. Back then, almost the only wildlife to be seen was “thousands of rabbits.”, From Ely, I drove south-east to a farm in Suffolk where Brian and Patrick Barker showed me how they are preparing for the introduction of the “polluter pays” laws. One of the cousins’ fields had been split into two strips, the first left bare after harvest, the second planted with phacelia, rye and radish. Over the winter, these “catch-crops” are left in the ground, where they capture the residual potash and nitrates from last year’s crop in their roots and stop them polluting nearby streams. At the end of the trial period, a comparison will be done between run-off from the two strips, and the catch-crops’ efficacy will be measured. Under the government’s new subsidy regime, environmentalism and economics will – in theory – perfectly align., The Barkers have started bringing livestock on to their fields to provide natural fertiliser – a nod to the old practice of “mixed” farming, whereby farmers grew crops and kept livestock, which went out with intensive methods. Brian told me that he had listened to Isabella Tree’s book Wilding twice while he was manoeuvring his combine harvester around the fields. He found it interesting, “but if everywhere was Knepp we’d have a lot of wildlife and not a lot else”., Every British farmer I spoke to while researching this article has an opinion on what the Burrells have done at Knepp, even if it is to damn the enterprise as tokenistic and unproductive. Environmentally friendly regeneration still has formidable opponents, among them old-school intensive farmers and the agribusinesses that make seeds and chemicals, as well as some plant scientists. In their view, a single unpalatable truth trumps any number of bees and buntings – and that is the looming global dearth of food., In 2009, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation warned that the global population would increase by 34% by 2050, to 9.1 billion. It added that “in order to feed this larger, more urban and richer population, food production … must increase by 70%”. In the light of the UN’s predictions, advocates of business-as-usual argue that the redirection of farmland towards public goods will lead to a massive shortfall in production, and that the solution is to grow more food., For Bill Clark, the technical director of the National Institute of Plant Botany (Niab), a research institute funded by some of Britain’s biggest farming enterprises, this means increasing yields. Clark regards the dispute over whether soil should be productive or healthy as a distraction from the basic choice between being able to feed people or not. “If yields don’t rise,” he told me at Niab’s headquarters in Cambridge, “people in north Africa” – a major export market for European farmers – “won’t simply be unable to afford the wheat they need in order to live: there will be no wheat.”, To Clark’s dismay, precisely at the point when Britain and the rest of Europe need a productivity spurt in order to export more to the world, yields have plateaued, thanks to what Clark called the “irrational dogma which says that technology is bad”., Clark is a believer in the power of science to improve the human lot. In his view we have become so blase about technological advance that we overlook the fact that science has saved countless people from starvation. He spoke with reverence of the revolution that highly fertile Japanese wheat wrought when it was crossed with European varieties in the 50s: “The plant halved in size but yields doubled.” Visit one of Niab’s walk-in growth chambers and you’ll see the newest miracle: wheat developed by using a gene from oats that confers immunity to the root disease known as take-all. The new strain can be sown in successive years on the same field without falling foul of the disease (conventional practice dictates that the way to avoid take-all is to plant wheat in rotation with different crops, which naturally lowers aggregate wheat production)., But Niab’s yield-enhancer cannot be marketed because of the EU’s hostility to genetically modified (GM) crops – a hostility that extends to an increasing number of chemicals including neonicitonoid insecticides. As a result of an EU ban of neonicitonoids, rapeseed yields crashed . “And if you were to take fungicides out of the equation,” Clark told me, “as campaigners are demanding, wheat yields would probably drop by 20-30%. Is that what people really want?”, It is possible that there is one particular sector of farmers who will not be overly affected by the new agriculture bill. Where economies of size combine with naturally fertile soil that hasn’t yet been destroyed by chemicals, intensive farming continues to be remunerative., Michael Sly’s family has been farming around the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, since the civil war, buying and selling land until Park Farm – as the Sly establishment is called – reached its present size of 1,600 hectares. Whether it is the annual service of thanksgiving he organises at harvest festival, the thousands who visit Park Farm on “open farm” weekend in June, or his chairmanship of the local history society, Sly enjoys the status of – his words – “a big commercial arable farmer”. And while he is proud of the margins he has set aside for bees and birds, Sly’s mission isn’t environmental services. It’s growing food., Sly’s professional vision is defined by his huge fields of sugar beet that stretch towards the horizon, his state-of-the-art tractors, seed drills and combine harvesters, each of which is worth “multiple tens of thousands of pounds”, and his contracts to supply premium grade wheat for national brands such as Weetabix and Mini-Cheddars. He regards wilding as relevant only to “a certain percentage of affluent society”, and his shiny new 2,000-tonne store – which bulged with grains when I visited – is a hymn to the mass market., Sly refuses to commit to techniques such as cover cropping or no-tillage that might reduce yields, and whose commercial viability is unproven. (For all the worms wriggling in their soils, the Cherry brothers’ farming operation is loss-making, and will probably remain so until subsidy reforms kick in.) Sly’s worry is that once Britain has left the EU, the government will remove tariffs on imported produce grown using neonicotinoids or GM, undercutting British farmers. (Britain already imports half its food. When UK oilseed rape yields plummeted following the neonicotinoid insecticide ban, the shortfall was made up by importing Canadian rapeseed oil that had been produced using the same insecticides.), Increased imports would endorse Sly’s deeper apprehension that the government is preparing to surrender entirely to the current “evangelism” for public goods that don’t fill bellies. With the country in the process of exiting the EU, which currently supplies 30% of the country’s agricultural needs, Sly does not hide his exasperation at the scant attention being paid to food security, the proud and – at present – impossible idea of the country feeding itself if there is a global shortage of food. “If Britain wants to carry on producing certain foods,” he said, “the system that is being proposed won’t be compatible with that goal. You have to ask yourself whether you want low-input, low-output farmers or high-input, high-output farmers. There’s no in-between.”, The obvious way to mitigate the shortages of food that the UN anticipates is to throw less away. After decades of plenty in some parts of the world, about one-third of the food that is produced each year, or about 1.3bn tonnes, goes to waste. The proportion of the budget of the average British household that goes on food has come down from more than 30% in the 60s to below 10% today. (After Singapore and the US, Britain has the cheapest food “basket” of any country.) It is little wonder that a commodity that people buy so casually, and with such little regard for the natural resources and human ingenuity that have gone into its production, should be discarded in such quantities., If there is no discernible panic among your fellow shoppers in the supermarket, this is because the prospect of shortages seems so remote from today’s glut. Isabella Tree contrasts the calls of “retailers, agribusiness and farmers’ unions” for the production of more food with “the experiences of farmers like ourselves, driven out of business by … low commodity prices resulting from subsidies and over-production”. Governments of neither left or right dare contemplate measures, such as imposing VAT on food, that would encourage thrift., While the debate continues over the use of advanced genetic and chemical crop-enhancers, technology is opening a whole new direction for food production, which will take farming away from the farm. Robotics and drones are reducing the need for humans to be on the land, while vertical farming, in which vegetables can be grown in sunless warehouses using LED lighting, gene editing and metagenics – the engineering of specific enzymes or proteins – are coming up with new definitions of food. According to a recent report by the thinktank RethinkX, within 15 years the rise of cell-based meat, which is made of animal cells grown in a bioreactor, will bankrupt the US’s huge beef industry, at the same time removing the need to grow soya and maize for feed. By 2035, the report predicts, an area a quarter of the size of the continental US “will be freed for other uses”., Although South American countries such as Brazil and Paraguay are expected to add 11m hectares to the global agricultural inventory between 2018 and 2027, in part by destroying the rainforests, agriculture’s footprint in the developed world is already decreasing, with “more land now being abandoned from agriculture than converted to it”, according to a recent study by the University of Minnesota. Already, as parliament has heard, a lot of British hill farmers are not being replaced when they retire. As a child in London, I heard my mother’s stories of growing up as the daughter of farmers on the Canadian Prairies. There was no Roundup weedkiller, though I’m sure my mother and her siblings, bent double to pick weeds from a field of mustard, would have appreciated it. For my own children, urbanites to their bones, their grandmother’s upbringing must be hard to conceive. Farming is retreating even from the imaginative capacity of most Britons., That many farmers confess to being confused and worried about their future is hardly surprising. The new measures will have a seven-year phasing-in period, at the end of which some of the small farmers who have been unable to adapt will go bust. What is to stop their land being swallowed up by big intensive farmers who don’t rely on subsidies? Others, rather than manoeuvre themselves through the hoops erected by public goods, may decide to turn their land over to enterprises less favourable to dormice and goldfinches: go-karting, motorbike scrambling or parcel distribution., A sentiment I heard repeatedly runs like this: farmers will do whatever society wants them to do, but the sums (ie, the subsidies, or market forces) have to be right., Even if the claims contained in the RethinkX report are overblown, a transformation of the kind it outlines seems not only possible but desirable. When I met him last autumn in a converted warehouse, now a restaurant, in London’s Kings Cross, Tony Juniper, the government’s chief adviser on the natural environment and a former head of Friends of the Earth, described a future in which the cost of LED bulbs is more significant to farmers than a late frost, and Londoners think nothing of weekending among lynxes and beavers in a rewilded green belt., Britain’s farming community is a tiny minority whose public influence is in terminal decline, and is destined to shrink further as technology requires fewer and fewer people to muddy themselves for a living. “The killer irony” of the revolution in farming, said Juniper, in a building that used to receive sack upon sack of golden English wheat, “is that farmers may not be around to see it.”, • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.the end of farming rewilding intensive agriculture food safety", "label": 0}, "train-407": {"text": "\nCountry diary: the lair of the blue-grey worm\n, Short Wood, Northamptonshire: Britain’s most colourful earthworm is most often seen in water-logged conditions, \nMatt Shardlow, \n\nTue 25 Feb 2020 00.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2020 05.58 EST\n\n, The wind roared through the trees last night and rain fell hard. Now, along the crest of the hill above Glapthorn village, within the shelter of Short Wood, it’s not muddy underfoot, it’s watery., Turning logs is a common pursuit of certain natural historian types, myself included. But today the sport is marred, as rolling a mossy log merely allows a puddle to rapidly flow into the newly exposed depression., The technique does reveal one very interesting animal: a favourite of mine, a blue-grey worm (Octolasion cyaneum). This is a substantially sized earthworm, although never as massive as a fully grown lobworm (Lumbricus terrestris). Blue-greys are most commonly observed in waterlogged conditions when, even in daylight, they will leave their shallow burrows and seek higher ground. The blue-grey is our most colourful earthworm: the pale pink head grades into a lilac body and the tip of the tail is abruptly primrose yellow – the easy diagnostic feature., Adult worms, such as this one, also sport a peach-coloured saddle. This band contains male and female sexual organs, but there is a twist: every blue-grey worm is a clone of its parent, there is no DNA-mixing stage at all, so those sexual organs are unrequited vestiges from a long-distant ancestor., Splashing along the ride, I spot several more blue-greys of various sizes, snaking slowly through the fallen leaves. The diversity of clone lines is exceptionally low; it is almost certain that all the blue-grey worms in the wood will be genetically identical., The wind grows in prominence as I approach the western end of the woodland. Great gusts break on to the wood, whence they transform into packs of writhing invisible Chinese dragons that bowl through the trees, twisting the slender ash boughs and tossing the oak branches hither and thither. Then the rain comes in big drops, but not for long. It turns out to be the storm’s parting shot, as minutes later the firmament – formerly unbroken grey clouds – has transformed into blue sky, the wind drops and the low sun sparkles across the wet ground.country diary the lair of the blue grey worm", "label": 0}, "train-408": {"text": "\nCoronavirus closures reveal vast scale of China’s secretive wildlife farm industry\n, \nCoronavirus closures reveal vast scale of China’s secretive wildlife farm industry\n, Peacocks, porcupines and pangolins among species bred on 20,000 farms closed in wake of virus, \nMichael Standaert in Shenzhen, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 22.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 06.58 EDT\n\n, Nearly 20,000 wildlife farms raising species including peacocks, civet cats, porcupines, ostriches, wild geese and boar have been shut down across China in the wake of the coronavirus, in a move that has exposed the hitherto unknown size of the industry., Until a few weeks ago wildlife farming was still being promoted by government agencies as an easy way for rural Chinese people to get rich., But the Covid-19 outbreak, which has now led to 2,666 deaths and over 77,700 known infections, is thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan in early December, prompting a massive rethink by authorities on how to manage the trade., China issued a temporary ban on wildlife trade to curb the spread of the virus at the end of January and began a widespread crackdown on breeding facilities in early February., The country’s top legislative officials are now rushing to amend the country’s wildlife protection law and possibly restructure regulations on the use of wildlife for food and traditional Chinese medicine., The current version of the law is seen as problematic by wildlife conservation groups because it focuses on utilisation of wildlife rather than its protection., “The coronavirus epidemic is swiftly pushing China to reevaluate its relationship with wildlife,” Steve Blake, chief representative of WildAid in Beijing, told the Guardian. “There is a high level of risk from this scale of breeding operations both to human health and to the impacts on populations of these animals in the wild.”, The National People’s Congress released new measures on Monday restricting wildlife trade, banning consumption of bushmeat and sales of wildlife for meat consumption at wet markets between now and the time the Wildlife Protection Law can be amended and adopted. Untouched however, are breeding operations for traditional Chinese medicine, fur and leather, lucrative markets known to drive illegal poaching of animals including tigers and pangolins., For the past few years China’s leadership has pushed the idea that “wildlife domestication” should be a key part of rural development, eco-tourism and poverty alleviation. A 2017 report by the Chinese Academy of Engineering on the development of the wildlife farming industry valued the wildlife-farming industry those operations at 520bn yuan, or £57bn., Just weeks before the outbreak, China’s State Forestry and Grassland Administration (SFGA) was still actively encouraging citizens to get into farming wildlife such as civet cats – a species pinpointed as a carrier of Sars, a disease similar to Covid-19. The SFGA regulates both farming and trade in terrestrial wildlife, and quotas of wildlife products – such as pangolin scales – allowed to be used by the Chinese medicine industry., “Why are civet cats still encouraged to be eaten after the Sars outbreak in 2003? It’s because the hunters, operators, practitioners need that. How can they achieve that? They urged the government to support them under the pretext of economic development,” Jinfeng Zhou, secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF), told the Guardian., On state TV the popular series Secrets of Getting Rich, which has aired since 2001, often touts these kinds of breeding operations – bamboo rats, snakes, toads, porcupines and squirrels have all had starring roles., But little was known about the scale of the wildlife farm industry before the coronavirus outbreak, with licensing mainly regulated by provincial and local-level forestry bureaus that do not divulge full information about the breeding operations under their watch. A report from state-run Xinhua news agency on 17 February revealed that from 2005–2013 the forestry administration only issued 3,725 breeding and operation licenses at the national level., But since the outbreak at least 19,000 farms have been shut down around the country, including about 4,600 in Jilin province, a major centre for traditional Chinese medicine. About 3,900 wildlife-farming operations were shuttered in Hunan province, 2,900 in Sichuan, 2,300 in Yunnan, 2,000 in Liaoning, and 1,000 in Shaanxi., There is little detail available about the animals farmed across China, but local press reports mention civet cats, bamboo rats, ostriches, wild boar, sika deer, foxes, ostriches, blue peacocks, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, wild geese, mallard ducks, red-billed geese, pigeons, and ring-necked pheasants., Neither do reports offer much detail about the shutdowns and what is happening to the animals, although Blake said he does not think animals are being culled, due to issues over compensation., Chen Hong, a peacock farmer in Liuyang, Hunan, said she is concerned about her losses and whether she will get compensation after her operations were suspended on 24 January., “We now aren’t allowed to sell the animals, transport them, or let anyone near them, and we have to sanitise the facility once every day,” Chen said. “Usually this time of year would see our farm bustling with clients and visitors. We haven’t received notice on what to do yet, and the peacocks are still here, and we probably won’t know what to do with them until after the outbreak is contained., “We’re very worried about the farm’s future,” she added. “The shutdown has resulted in a loss of 400,000–500,000 yuan (£44,000–55,000) in sales, and if they decide to put an outright ban on raising peacocks, we’ll lose even more, at least a million yuan(£110,000).”, On a visit to Shaoguan, Guangdong province, last year, the Guardian and staff from CBCGDF saw a caged facility previously used for attempted breeding of the notoriously hard-to-breed pangolin., While there were no longer pangolin at the site, several locals near the facility confirmed the species had been raised there, along with monkeys and other wildlife., Besides being used for Chinese medicine, much of the meat from the wildlife trade is sold through online platforms or to “wet markets” like the one where the Covid-19 outbreak is thought to have started in Wuhan., “All animals or their body parts for human consumption are supposed to go through food and health checks, but I don’t think the sellers ever bothered,” said Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and an expert on animal protection in China. “Most of them have been sold without such health checks.”, There have been calls for a deep regulatory overhaul to remove the conflicting duties of the forestry administration, and for a shift in government mindset away from promoting the utilisation of wildlife and towards its protection., “The ‘referee-player’ combination needs to be addressed and is the toughest challenge,” Li Shuo, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia told the Guardian. “This goes back to the institutional identity of the SFGA which was established to oversee timber production. Protection was an afterthought.”, Proposals include fully banning trade in wildlife that is protected or endangered within and outside of China, plus bans on raising and selling meat from known carriers of diseases that can impact humans such as civets, bats and rodents., There are concerns that in trying to prevent outbreaks authorities may go too far in the culling of wild animals that can carry disease., “Some law professors have suggested ‘ecological killing’ of disease-transmitting wild animals, such as pangolins, hedgehogs, bats, snakes, and some insects,” Zhou said. “We believe lawmakers need to learn more about biodiversity before advising on the revisions to the law, or they’ll bring disaster.”, Additional research and reporting assistance provided by Jonathan Zhong.coronavirus closures reveal vast scale of chinas secretive wildlife farm industry", "label": 0}, "train-409": {"text": "\nWaste crisis: Victoria offers businesses $96.5m to process recycling\n, Premier says overhaul will ‘take responsibility for our waste’ and help fix longstanding problems , Staff and agencies, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 22.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2020 04.46 EST\n\n, The Victorian government will double its $28m in grants for businesses to sort and process recycling as part of a $96.5m package to fix the state’s waste industry., Another $30m will be opened up for grants for technology to create new products from recyclable materials such as glass, plastic, organics, electronic waste, concrete, brick and rubber., A further $10m will be offered to businesses to recycle more in their daily operations, and $10m will go towards waste-for-energy initiatives for processors of waste that can’t be recycled., More than $11m will be opened up for expressions of interest for treatment of hazardous waste to prevent further stockpiles from rogue operators across the state. And a $7m business innovation centre will work on waste solutions research, bringing together industry, universities and councils to develop new technologies., The premier, Daniel Andrews, said the package was “the biggest transformation of our recycling system that our state has ever seen”., “It is absolutely necessary given that China and other countries have made it very clear that we have to take responsibility for our waste and not simply ship it to the other side of the world.”, A day earlier, the state government announced a container deposit scheme by 2023, to bring Victoria into line with the rest of the nation., Victorian households will also have to sort their waste into four bins as part of the overhaul, separating glass from other recyclables., The new funding was welcomed by the chief executive of the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia, Gayle Sloan, who said the infrastructure investment was key to expanding domestic markets for recycled products., “By committing funding the Victorian government gives industry confidence that they are at the table with us, working with us to solve these challenges,” Sloan said in a statement. “Our essential industry alone cannot solve these recent challenges – it is a shared responsibility that requires all parts of the supply chain including government and the community to work together to solve”., The managing director of Coca-Cola Amatil in Australia, Peter West, also supported the announcement, saying the company now produced 70% of its bottles from 100% recycled material. , “We want a local industry,” West said. “The material we have is a good first step, which is 16,000 tonnes of material that comes from Taiwan. , “We want that to be local product … We couldn’t even source that material in Australia today.”waste crisis victoria offers businesses 965m to process recycling", "label": 0}, "train-410": {"text": "\nGreat Australian Bight: Equinor abandons plans to drill for oil\n, Norwegian oil company announces it has scrapped its $200m plan to deepwater drill in Great Australian Bight Marine Park, \nAdam Morton Environment editor, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 19.12 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2020 21.06 EST\n\n, Norwegian oil giant Equinor has abandoned plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight, declaring the controversial project did not make commercial sense., The company said on Tuesday it had told federal, South Australian and local authorities it had decided to scrap the $200m project to deepwater drill in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park., It is the third major oil company to abandon plans to drill in the bight, following BP and Chevron., “Following a holistic review of its exploration portfolio, Equinor has concluded that the project’s potential is not commercially competitive compared with other exploration opportunities in the company,’’ the company’s country manager for Australia, Jone Stangeland, said in a statement., The decision is a significant win for environment groups and other opponents of the project, including Indigenous elders and local councils. The proposal sparked protests supported by tens of thousands of people opposed to fossil fuel extraction in a marine wilderness area., Equinor’s announcement comes shortly after the proposed Stromlo-1 well site, in water more than 2.2km deep and nearly 400km off the South Australian coast, was granted environmental approval by the federal offshore petroleum regulator. The Wilderness Society launched legal action challenging the decision last month, arguing opponents had not been properly consulted., Peter Owen, the Wilderness Society’s South Australian director, welcomed Equinor’s decision to “responsibly withdraw” from the project., “It’s been a while coming, but the right decision is the right decision, and we have no doubt that the hundreds of thousands of people that have supported the campaign to fight for the Bight will be both delighted and relieved to hear this news,” he said., Owen called on the Morrison government to “listen to the people and permanently protect the unique waters of the Great Australian Bight from drilling for good”., The federal minister for resources, Keith Pitt, said the government was disappointed about Equinor’s decision, but pleased the company had made clear it would still be part of the oil and gas industry in Australia. It said the decision would be “particularly hard for South Australia”., He said the government remained committed to “encouraging the safe development of Australia’s offshore petroleum resources. “The Bight basin remains one of Australia’s frontier basins and any proposals for new oil and gas fields in this area will be assessed fairly and independently,” he said., Equinor was granted a petroleum title over areas in the Bight in 2011. In December, it cleared the second of four regulatory hurdles it needed to pass before it could start drilling, when the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, known as Nopsema, granted its environmental approval., The company described the decision as an important milestone that followed more than 400 meetings with community and other organisations. Environmentalists, local councils and elders of the traditional owners of the Bight, the Mirning people, denied they had been properly consulted and vowed to continue to fight the project., Industry body the Australian Petroleum and Production and Exploration Association said the company’s decision to drop the project was disappointing for South Australians, who would have benefited economically, and for the “wider Australian community”, which needed new energy supplies., Matthew Doman, the association’s chief executive, said: “The proposed exploration activity had been subject to an extreme campaign of false and exaggerated claims that deliberately overstated the risks and ignored the potential benefits.”, Greenpeace Australia Pacific’s chief executive, David Ritter, said the decision was an “incredible win for people power and nature”. He said it followed years of relentless campaigning by coastal communities, Indigenous traditional owners, surfers, the seafood industry, tourism operators and local businesses., “Never doubt the power and determination of the Australian people,” Ritter said., Sarah Hanson Young, the Greens environment spokeswoman and a South Australian senator, called on other parties to back Greens’ legislation that would put the Bight forward for world heritage protection., “Opening a new fossil fuel basin in the middle of our ocean was always madness,” she said. Moving to net zero emissions by 2050 means we must reduce pollution now, not give the green light to new polluting projects.”, Noah Schultz-Byard, South Australian director of the Australia Institute, said polling suggested an overwhelming majority of people would support world heritage listing for the Bight., Stangeland said Equinor said it still held an offshore exploration permit in Western Australia and would maintain “other ongoing interests and activities in Australia”.great australian bight equinor abandons plans to drill for oil", "label": 0}, "train-411": {"text": "\nNewly waterproofed Arctic seed vault hits 1m samples\n, Rapid climate change forced urgent upgrade of ‘failsafe’ doomsday storage facility, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 19.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2020 19.05 EST\n\n, The Arctic global seed vault has reached the milestone of having 1m varieties stored in its deep freeze. The new deposits are being made after unexpected flooding of its entrance tunnel in 2017 prompted an upgrade., Seeds from 60,000 crop varieties from across the world are being placed in the vault to back up those held in other seed banks., The €9m (£7.5m) underground facility in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard opened in 2008 as a “failsafe” store. But the unexpectedly rapid pace of global heating led to melting of the permafrost that had encased it., Now, a €20m refurbishment by the Norwegian government means the vault is secure for the future and “absolutely watertight”, according to officials., The destruction of nature means vital diversity of crops and their wild relatives are being lost, at a time when the impact of the climate emergency means new varieties are needed to cope with changing weather and pests. Seed banks can also be destroyed by power loss and war, as happened in Aleppo, Syria, making the Svalbard vault crucial., Tuesday’s deposits, from 36 institutions, are the most diverse and include seeds of 27 wild plants from Prince Charles’s Highgrove estateas well as seeds of the candy roaster squash, which are being deposited by the Cherokee Nation in the US., Wild emmer wheat, known as the “mother of wheat” when it was discovered in 1906, is being deposited by Haifa University in Israel, alongside potato varieties from Peru and other crops from Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar and New Zealand. Each sample contains roughly 500 seeds., The Svalbard vault, which is carved into solid rock, houses samples of about 1,050,000 crop varieties from 5,000 species. This represents two-fifths of the estimated 2.4m varieties in the world, and the vault has plenty of room to accommodate them., “Crop diversity is an essential basis of food production,” said Hannes Dempewolf, a scientist at Crop Trust, which operates the vault alongside the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre. “And the Svalbard vault is the essential backup facility for seed banks around the world, safeguarding the biodiversity they hold.”, Many crop varieties have been lost, including 93% of fruit and vegetable varieties in the US., “The issue of some water intrusion in the entrance tunnel was certainly not foreseen during construction,” Dempewolf said. “No one thought summers would be so warm., Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s, The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.”, Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.”, Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases., A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases., An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”., The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”, A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states., Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions., Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research., Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”., At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”, Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”, The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC., The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray., A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century., The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry., Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president., Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming., Jonathan Watts, “A major upgrade was the only right thing to do and the Norwegian government has certainly put the resources up to make sure that it is absolutely watertight now.”, Hege Njaa Aschim, a spokeswoman for the government, which owns the vault, said: “The entrance tunnel and the upgrade will secure the seed vault for the future.”, In 2017, she told the Guardian: “A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel … The vault was supposed to operate without the help of humans.” No water reached the seed vaults., The 130-metre entrance tunnel has been fully waterproofed and the cooling equipment that keeps the vault at -18C moved to a new service building, so heat from the machinery can be released outside. The vault is 130 metres above sea level and designed for a “virtually infinite lifetime”., “It is always dangerous to talk about something being completely failsafe and impregnable,” Dempewolf said. “In 20, 30, 40 years down the line, we will continue to monitor the situation to see whether any other upgrades are necessary.”newly waterproofed arctic seed vault 1m samples climate change", "label": 0}, "train-412": {"text": "\nFarmers pile pressure on UK government over chlorinated chicken\n, Calls for food standards to be enshrined in law to avoid post-Brexit ‘betrayal’ of consumers, \nFiona Harvey and \nLisa O'Carroll, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 19.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 25 Feb 2020 08.21 EST\n\n, Farmers have hit back at suggestions the government will allow imports of chlorinated chicken and other low-standard farm produce in trade talks with the US, escalating the row over post-Brexit food standards., Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, will call for rules on minimum standards for imports to be enshrined in law, and insist that other countries must trade with the UK “on our terms”, rather than seek to water down food rules., “We must not tie the hands of British farmers to the highest rung of the standards ladder while waving through food imports which may not even reach the bottom rung,” Batters will tell the NFU’s annual conference on Tuesday., “If the government is serious about animal welfare and environmental protection, and doing more than any previous government, it must put legislation in the agriculture bill.”, Farmers were told last month by Theresa Villiers, the former secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, that chlorinated chicken – which the US wants to be allowed to export to the UK, where it is currently banned on health grounds – would be excluded from any trade talks., Farmers fear they will face a flood of cheap imports undercutting high-standard British produce, and the potential for the EU to ban UK-produced food if standards were relaxed., But the government refused to enshrine Villiers’ promises into the agricultural bill going through parliament, and she was sacked in the reshuffle. At the weekend, the new environment secretary, George Eustice, refused to repeat her assurances, reigniting the row and infuriating farmers., Batters will present the dispute as an issue of public safety. “What is government waiting for?” she will ask. “What is more important to our economy, our health and our environment than the very food we eat?”, She will call for ministers to “show global leadership, insist that UK farms standards are the benchmark for climate-friendly farming around the world, and that whoever wants to trade with us trades on our terms. We must not allow those standards to be undermined by imports of goods which would be illegal for our farmers to produce here.”, Chlorinated chicken has grabbed the headlines but other practices pose a greater potential threat to human health. Within the EU, the use of antibiotics on farm animals falls under strict guidelines, which many other countries lack. Profligate use of antibiotics for meat production is linked to the evolution of superbugs, raising the spectre of a health “apocalypse” that could mean even routine operations become life-threatening., Batters will say: “In Japan, Australia, China, Canada, Brazil, Malaysia and India, the use of antibiotics is permitted for growth promotion. This isn’t just about chlorinated chicken. This is about a wider principle.”, Kath Dalmeny, the chief executive of the Sustain alliance for better food and farming, accused the government of betraying consumers. “Just last year George Eustice said US imports would have to conform to ‘British law and British standards’ or the US could ‘kiss goodbye to any trade deal and join the back of the queue’,” she said., “Now, it seems he is prepared to bend over backwards to make the case for the US and their hormone-injected, acid-washed, antibiotic-intensive, low-welfare chicken. This is an outrageous betrayal of the British people and deeply worrying for our farmers. The government should be leading the way in high-quality, high-welfare food, not softening up the public to make low-grade food more palatable.”, A government spokesperson said: “We have repeatedly been clear that we will uphold our high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards outside the EU. The government will stand firm in trade negotiations to ensure our future trade deals live up to the values of farmers and consumers across the UK.”, Eustice is expected to use his speech to the conference on Wednesday morning to launch a consultation on the future of farm subsidies after the UK leaves the EU., “We can all agree that we want British farming to be sustainable in the truest sense of the word, an industry which is profitable, competitive and productive while feeding the nation and taking care of our landscapes too,” he will say., In the agriculture bill progressing through parliament, farmers have been promised a new system of environmental land management contracts, which will reward them for measures to protect public goods, such as water and air quality, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and preserving wildlife and nature., However, campaigners are concerned it contains many loopholes, which will reduce the environmental protections currently in operation under EU regulations., Farmers and land managers will have 10 weeks to respond to the government’s proposals.farmers pile pressure on uk government over chlorinated chicken", "label": 0}, "train-413": {"text": "\nUK lags behind in €124bn European low-carbon investment table\n, Britain contributed only 3% of continent’s 2019 green spending, report says, \nJillian Ambrose Energy correspondent, \n\nMon 24 Feb 2020 19.01 EST\n\n, British companies are lagging far behind their European neighbours in low-carbon investment after contributing only 3% of the continent’s €124bn (£104.2bn) green spending last year., A report has revealed that German-listed companies invested 11 times more in low-carbon investments such as electric vehicles, renewable energy and smart energy grids than UK firms., London-listed companies spent €4bn on green research and technologies compared with €44.4bn from German groups, including the carmaker Volkswagen, which invested more than a third of Europe’s total low-carbon spending in 2019., The report, from the climate disclosure organisation CDP, said Germany, Spain and Italy topped the company league table for low-carbon investment last year while the UK finished sixth, below France and Denmark., The report, which was co-authored by the global management consulting firm Oliver Wyman, reflected well on countries that are home to major manufacturers and utilities that have made heavy investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy projects in the last year., By contrast, UK companies did not fare as well in the investment rankings because much of the country’s green infrastructure spending is outsourced to foreign companies, including Spain’s Iberdrola, the owner of Scottish Power, and the Danish wind power giant Ørsted., The report warned that despite the €124bn investment in green solutions across the continent, low-carbon spending will need to double if Europe hopes to meet its climate targets., On average, companies included in the report dedicated about 12% of their annual spending to low-carbon technologies but this will need to rise to 25% to help create a carbon-neutral Europe., UK and EU leaders have agreed to be climate neutral, or “net zero”, by 2050 in a bid to keep global temperatures from climbing to levels that could lead to catastrophic climate chaos., Steven Tebbe, the managing director of CDP in Europe, said achieving this goal means that Europe’s economy needs to cut its emissions at the rate of nearly 8%, which requires “a fundamental transformation of our economic business model”., He said: “The investment decisions taken by European companies and their owners will make or break whether we are successful – and they need to double down.” , The report found that almost 900 listed European companies invested a total of €59bn in new low-carbon capital investments and €65bn in research and development last year., The biggest areas of new investment were in research and development of electric vehicle technologies, which reached €43bn across Europe, and capital investment in renewable energy, which reached €16bn. Investment in energy grid infrastructure and smart energy technology climbed to €15bn and €8bn respectively., “Across many types of investment, the business case for transitioning businesses on to a low-carbon pathway is clear and the opportunities vast,” Tebbe said., The CDP estimates that the potential value of Europe’s new low-carbon business opportunities could reach €1.22tn – more than six times the €192bn of green investment required to realise this financial benefit., “But overall current investment levels are still short of putting European firms on track for net zero emissions,” he said., “For industries where decarbonisation is more challenging, there is a serious need for financial markets and policymakers to create better conditions for low-carbon investment and deliver stronger incentives to drive investment into breakthrough technologies, where capital expenditure is often high and returns long-term.” uk lags behind in 124bn european low carbon investment table", "label": 0}, "train-414": {"text": "\nClimate crisis cutting short Australia's winters and extending summers\n, New report from Australia Institute says trend will bring with it longer and hotter bushfires, more heatwaves and crop damage , \nLuke Henriques-Gomes, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 15.54 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 1 Mar 2020 17.49 EST\n\n, Australia’s summers are getting longer and winters have become shorter as a result of global heating, according to a new report from the Australia Institute., The discussion paper, to be released on Monday, said that trend was “highly likely” to continue and would bring with it longer and hotter bushfire seasons, more heatwaves, while agricultural crops will be damaged, livestock will suffer and entire ecosystems will be placed at risk., “If it feels like Australian summers are getting longer and hotter, that is probably because they are,” the report said. “The summers many Australians grew up with no longer exist.”, The researchers Tom Swann and Mark Ogge examined Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) temperature data from 70 weather stations across the country to compare daily average temperatures over the past two decades with an earlier mid-20th century benchmark., They found that between 1999 and 2018 Australia experienced summer temperatures for a full 31 days longer, compared to a benchmark between 1950 and 1969, while winter temperatures lasted 23 fewer days over the same comparative periods., Over the past two decades, summer was on average a month longer than it was in the mid-20th century. The report said temperatures that “marked the start of summer now come around two weeks earlier”, and “temperatures that marked the end of summer now come around two weeks later”., Last month, the Bureau of Meteorology confirmed 2019 was Australia’s hottest year on record, although the Australia Institute report was unable to include 2019 data in its analysis., The researchers also narrowed in on temperatures over the past five years, measured against that same 1950-1969 benchmark, and found that summers were now on average close to 50% longer. “These most recent summers were twice as long as the most recent winters,” the report added., Examining the data, the discussion paper said that while in “every capital city, summers have grown longer and winters have grown shorter”, there was evidence of even larger changes in regional areas., For example, the report said that summers were 48 days or seven weeks longer in Port Macquarie, and that the length of winter had halved in seven areas across the country., Meanwhile, summers were now 38 days longer in Melbourne, 36 days longer in Adelaide, and 35 days longer in Hobart and Perth. In Sydney, summer was now 118 days, 28 days longer than it had been on average in the mid-20th century., Although they say that “caution is needed extrapolating to the future from past observations, especially over short time frames”, the researchers said it is “highly likely over the medium and longer them that summers will continue to get longer and hotter”., “These trends are likely to continue indefinitely unless greenhouse gas emissions are decisively reduced, ultimately to net-zero,” the report said., Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said longer summers and shorter winters would leave less time for authorities to enforce bushfire management strategies., He said that Australia was currently experiencing 1C of global warming, but that the government’s current emissions reduction targets are “aligned with 3 to 4C of warming, which leaves young Australians facing ever lengthening summers with significant consequences”., The researchers drew on data from weather stations in subtropical and temperate areas across southern Queensland and Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Tasmania., The discussion paper adds to analysis showing the impact of the climate crisis on Australia’s summers., A Victorian CFA and BoM study released last year found that global heating was in part responsible for the increased length of bushfire seasons, while a 2017 ANU study found that even if the Paris agreement targets were met, summer heatwaves in major Australian cities were likely to reach highs of 50C by 2040.climate crisis cutting short australias winters and extending summers", "label": 0}, "train-415": {"text": "\nWarm winter puts paid to German ice wine production\n, Temperatures have not fallen far enough for grapes to freeze on the vine as process requires, Associated Press in Frankfurt, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 14.05 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 1 Mar 2020 16.10 EST\n\n, A warm winter means that for the first time in years Germany’s vineyards will produce no ice wine, an expensive golden nectar made from grapes left to freeze on the vine., The German Wine Institute said on Sunday that temperatures had not dropped to the prerequisite low of -7C (19F) in any of the country’s wine regions., A succession of warm winters have reduced ice wine production in recent years, the wine industry’s marketing arm said. Only seven producers managed to make it in 2017, and only five in 2013. It did not say how far back records went., “If warm winters become more frequent over the coming years, ice wines from Germany’s regions will will soon become an even more expensive rarity than they already are,” said Ernst Büscher, a spokesman for the institute., Freezing the grapes before they are crushed concentrates the sugar and leads to an intensely sweet wine often served with dessert. It has always been a niche product, accounting for about 0.1% of German production, and the low volumes make it expensive., Making ice wine is a tricky business. Workers must race into the vineyards to harvest the grapes with only a few hours notice when the temperature falls, often at night or in the early morning. The grapes have to be pressed while still frozen, so the winemakers work in unheated facilities. Vineyard owners also face the risk that grapes set aside for ice wine will rot on the vine before the temperature drops far enough., Canada’s Niagara peninsula is one of several other places where ice wine is produced, thanks to its cold winters. It is also made in the US in northern Michigan and Ashtabula county, Ohio, near Lake Erie., Major markets for German ice wine include Japan, China, Scandinavia and the US, the institute said.  warm winter puts paid to german ice wine production", "label": 0}, "train-416": {"text": "Inside Australia's climate emergency: the lost harvest, Australia is known for its fresh food and great wine — but that could change as the weather becomes hotter, drier and more unpredictable.

Farmers are now saying, “This is serious and we want to get on with doing things,” he says., A warming climate is changing the food we eat, the wine we drink, and the price of fruit and vegetables in the supermarket., The increased temperature and changing weather patterns of the past 20 years have already reduced wheat production and changed where crops such as cotton can be grown. Produce has been damaged by extreme weather events. And late-season frosts, smoke from bushfires and the migration of pests and weeds pose additional threats. , Projected output has dropped by as much as 25% in some parts of Australia’s cropping and grazing industries.

Others are changing their varietal mix, introducing grapes from southern Italy, Sicily and Greece that are more heat-tolerant., Barlow says wine producers have been able to adjust their practices to take into account the global 1C temperature rise that has already occurred. So far, he says, the quality of Australian wines has not decreased., But global heating of 2C or even 3C, and the heat extremes and water scarcity it would bring, “could be a lot tougher”., “Some vineyards in particular areas would have some very tough decisions to make,” he says., The Jarretts have spent years adapting their winemaking business for a warmer world., They’ve invested in infrastructure to help them manage the compressed harvest time, and introduced more sustainable soil and pest management practices. , In other areas, they’ve looked to buy time. Orange is a cool climate region and the highest in altitude of Australia’s wine districts. It is also currently in drought., Jarrett is growing some grape varieties at higher elevations than he used to. Sauvignon blanc, for instance, which he used to grow at 700m, has been moved up to 900m., He thinks he can keep moving his operations up to about 1100m before he has to buy more land., “We have to have a 20-year plan.

After 20 years of voluntary action, recycling and recovery rates have gone backwards,” director of the Boomerang Alliance, Jeff Angel said., “This pitiful situation is contributing to the ocean becoming a plastic soup. Labels showing potential recycling are insufficient - actual recycling must occur and be mandated, to keep faith with the community.”, The call for mandated targets comes after the government announced that all Australian packaging should be reusable, compostable or recyclable by 2025 at the latest after a recycling industry crisis triggered by a Chinese ban on imported plastic waste., Labor also called for more government action, criticising the coalition for an 18 month delay to a product stewardship review, and for a lack of new funds for recycling infrastructure investment., “We need more than talk; we can’t just talk rubbish, we need to make change,” Labor’s assistant environment minister, Josh Wilson, said., “If the government doesn’t get its skates on, we going to see more stockpiling of plastic, which of course is a fire risk (and) we’re going to see more plastic going into landfill, and potentially into our oceans.”, The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said she was concerned that mandating plastic targets would lead to increased cost for consumers and would be impossible to regulate, but said the government had deliberately set “ambitious” targets., However, she said if the 2025 targets were missed, then she would not rule out further government intervention., She also said the forthcoming legislation to ban plastic exports – currently 187,000 tonnes a year – was key to seeing an “Australia solution” in place that dealt with end to end processing., “That will give business the confidence to invest and it is critical that they do,” Ley said., “Kit (equpiment) does have to be brought in, facilities do have to be set up, it is an ambitious timeline.”, She said that to process the plastic waste currently sent overseas, six new plants would be needed at an estimated cost of $250m, but stressed the federal government would only partially fund the new processing plants., To coincide with the summit, confectionary company Nestlé will announce a partnership with IQ Renew for a soft plastic recycling trial to collect soft plastics from 100,000 homes as part of kerbside recycling., The project aims to find a way to collect, sort and process soft plastics – which make up 20% of Australia’s landfill rubbish – that can be broadly adopted., McDonalds will also announce plans to move away from single use plastics., Ley welcomed the initiatives, saying business was taking the lead because they recognised an economic opportunity and the demand from consumers for change., “Industry is doing this because it makes sense for them, and part of the reason for that is because it is what consumers expect,” Ley told Guardian Australia., The summit comes ahead of a council of Australian governments meeting later this month that will finalise the details of the government’s proposed export ban, which will apply to waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres.scott morrison to pledge new rules and better infrastructure to boost recycling", "label": 0}, "train-418": {"text": "\nDramatic fall in China pollution levels ‘partly related’ to coronavirus\n, Nasa satellite images show decline as industrial activity slows in effort to limit coronavirus, \nCaroline Davies, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 07.19 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 06.57 EDT\n\n, Nasa satellite images show a dramatic decline in pollution levels over China, which the US space agency believes is “partly related” to an economic slowdown due to the coronavirus., Nasa scientists said the reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels, the noxious gas emitted from motor vehicles, power plants and industrial facilities, was first evident near Wuhan city, the source of the outbreak, but then spread across the country., Images from Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) pollution monitoring satellites were used to compare the first two months of 2019 with the same period this year., The maps show NO2 – nitrogen dioxide – values across China from 1-20 January, before the quarantine, and 10-25 February, during the quarantine. The decline comes as China’s manufacturers stop work in an effort to contain coronavirus., “This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,” said Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at Nasa’s Goddard space flight centre., Liu said there was a drop in NO2 over several countries during the economic recession that began in 2008, but the decrease was gradual. Scientists had also observed a significant reduction around Beijing during the 2008 Olympics, but pollution levels rose again after the Games ended., The drop in NO2 levels in 2020 also coincided with lunar new year celebrations in China and across much of Asia, when businesses and factories generally close. Usually levels increase at the end of this festive period., While the lunar new year may have played a role in the recent drop-off, researchers believe this decrease is more than a holiday effect or weather-related variation. Levels of NO2 in eastern and central China were significantly – 10-30% – lower than what is normally observed for this time period, Nasa said., “This year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer,” said Liu. “I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimise the spread of the virus.”dramatic fall in china pollution levels partly related to coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-419": {"text": "\nA major climate victory over Heathrow was aided by apathy in Downing Street\n, The environment was the winner in court: but what will happen when No 10 is determined to force a project through?, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 1 Mar 2020 03.48 EST\n\n, Live by the greenwash, die by it too. Barely six days after Heathrow Airport declared it had been certified carbon neutral, its third-runway ambitions were trapped in a peat bog. The court of appeal decided that UK aviation policy had not sufficiently made reference to the Paris climate change agreement; and the government declared with a straight face that, committed as it was to a greener future, it would simply have to bow to the judge., However much the law has spoken and campaigners have won a famous victory, it is once again opportunistic politics, above legal judgments and environmental concerns, that will doom the scheme., For Heathrow, it is not so much Groundhog Day as groundhog decade. Almost exactly 10 years ago, in March 2010, a high court judge upheld the claims of anti-third-runway protesters, ruling that the government had failed to scrupulously account for climate change in approving the London airport’s expansion. The verdict required the government to redraw its policy statement; but the Conservative leader, David Cameron, had pinned his colours to the anti-expansion mast. In the wake of the election two months later, he was in Downing Street and it was clear that the scheme was dead., A strikingly similar scenario appears to have killed off Heathrow’s ambitions again last week. While the airport believes the judgment only presents a small hurdle to clear, it cannot do so if the government declines to jump. For Boris Johnson, in whom those Churchillian qualities of decisive, bold leadership are daily more absent, the ruling is perfect cover. Instead of either embracing or challenging the ruling, the PM left it to his transport secretary to say that the government did not have a dog in this fight, and that Heathrow could appeal if it wanted to., It is, therefore, difficult to prove the claim that this ruling marks a historic watershed whereby governments must rein in policy to the greater demands of the Paris climate accords. The true test case will surely be when a scheme upon which a government is hell-bent is forced through the environmental wringer. Campaigners will hope the Department for Transport proves equally unattached to its prospective multibillion-pound road-building projects, such as the Oxford-to-Cambridge expressway or the Lower Thames Crossing., Much has, of course, changed since 2010: ever more people are aware of the climate emergency, and – at least outside Trump’s America – the imperative to act is perceived to be far more urgent. The aviation industry itself has, belatedly, addressed the need to clean up. But whether Johnson, who immediately availed himself of a long-haul flight to the Caribbean to enjoy his first weeks as prime minister, is any more dedicated an environmentalist than his husky-hugging forebear remains to be seen., The financial crisis swiftly changed priorities for the government in the years after 2010, with Cameron soon commissioning an inquiry to restore the runway he had ruled out, in the name of economic growth. It remains to be seen whether coronavirus will indeed surpass the banking crisis for wrecking the global economy, or just how much Brexit will affect Britain’s own economic health. Both, certainly, could cause enough woe to make foreign travel less desirable or affordable – potentially solving the problem of airport capacity., But should Britain trundle on, post-Brexit, into the bog-standard doldrums, it would be little surprise to see Heathrow’s runway back on the agenda. In the same breath as it vaunted its environmental credentials, the government said airport expansion remained core to economic growth., For all the current talk of “levelling up” the regions, the reasons that the Cameron-appointed Airports Commission decided a bigger Heathrow was a better bet than, say, Birmingham or a fantasy Thames island airport, are unlikely to change. With luck, another two decades of stalling may provide time to develop planes clean enough for Heathrow’s – and the government’s – green claims to ring true., The parallels with the 2008 financial crisis have become all too clear: stock markets falling by record amounts in a single day, with the FTSE and Dow Jones indices posting the fastest corrections – a drop of at least 10% from the previous peak – since 1933 and the depths of the Great Depression., The coronavirus panic spreading around the planet has triggered an unfurling crisis for the world economy, with the worst-case scenario including world GDP collapsing into recession for the first time since the banks went bust. The question, for now, is how central banks and governments can stem the bleeding., There is little comfort to be had from the former. After a decade of interest rates remaining close to the lowest levels on record, central banks lack the capacity to respond by cutting them further. The Bank of England still has interest rates at 0.75%, compared with 5.75% at the outset of the last crisis. It is purchasing around £435bn of government bonds, under its quantitative easing programme, to keep borrowing costs at record lows., The US Federal Reserve has more room to operate, but the European Central Bank stands perhaps least well equipped, with negative interest rates in place amid weak growth across the eurozone., Furthermore, the coronavirus represents a massive shock to the supply side of the economy, whereas central bank strategies serve to support demand. Monetary policy cannot keep factories open if an epidemic has closed them. , However, companies that come under strain as their customers are forced awaywill require the support to weather the storm until the supply-side constraints are lifted. For this, monetary policy can help – albeit this time in a limited way. Instead, governments will need to step in with direct financial aid. Just like in 2008, the state will have to intervene., It’s a racing certainty that the 2005 Gambling Act will be radically overhauled or completely replaced during this parliament. Public outrage at scandals involving the industry has reached a tipping point, and going after betting firms looks like an easy PR win for a government that could do with one., Yes, tighter regulation could eat into the annual £3bn tax take that comes from betting. But that should be offset against the cost to society of problem gambling, estimated by some to be up to £1.2bn., According to the National Audit Office, the industry has been running rings around its regulator, the Gambling Commission, which does some sterling work in dishing out fines for problem gambling and anti-money laundering failures., But still the transgressions continue, and the NAO fears a watchdog with just £19m of funds is toothless in the face of an industry that wins £11.3bn a year from punters., A beefed-up commission is one likely outcome of new legislation, but much more is at stake, including online casino stake limits, tougher affordability checks on punters, and curbs on much-criticised VIP programmes., Gambling firms have everything to lose and deep pockets, so they are not going to give up without a fight. Already, warriors are being dispatched to the frontline., The newly formed industry trade body, the Betting and Gaming Council, representing betting shops, online gaming business and casinos, recruited former pubs lobbyist Brigid Simmonds to chair it, while ex-Labour MP Michael Dugher is its new chief executive. A former political journalist, Kevin Schofield, has been named as its new communications chief. Philip Davies MP, a staunch friend of the gambling industry, is set for a seat on the department for culture, media and sport select committee., That’s a formidable alliance boasting connections throughout Westminster.

Common wombats are more abundant than southern hairy-nosed wombats., “There’s simply no excuse for this over-the-top lethal intervention, particularly considering simple solutions to prevent damage such as wombat gates are now available,” said Evan Quartermain from the Humane Society International., “That these latest allegations of wombats being shot are on the Yorke Peninsula is particularly concerning. It’s a highly fragmented population, and Point Pearce is one of just three colonies thought to have more than 100 individuals. It’s an area of great conservation significance.”, Quartermain said legal wildlife culling, authorised by state governments, was “occurring at extremely alarming levels nationwide”., The southern hairy-nosed wombat was nominated for threatened species listing several times under the Environment Protections and Biosecurity Conservation Act, but is not currently listed. Quartermain said the Humane Society was in the process of renominating the species, which is under threat from Sarcoptic mange and habitat loss., The Yorke Peninsula population is the smallest of the four main wild populations, which include the Eyre Peninsula and Murraylands and the largest population of between 50,000 to 100,000 wombats on the Nullarbor plain in SA and Western Australia., Estimates from 2014 put the population on the Yorke Peninsula at just 696 wombats spread over 25 colonies, of which Point Pearce is the largest with 135 individuals., A native title determination confirming Narungga rights over the Yorke Peninsula, including Point Pearce, is scheduled for a federal court hearing in June., The Point Pearce office of the Aboriginal Lands Trust told Guardian Australia on Monday it was not commenting on the issue.south australia blasted for issuing permit to cull southern hairy nosed wombat", "label": 0}, "train-421": {"text": "\nMore than 80% of Indian Ocean dolphins may have been killed by commercial fishing, study finds\n, An estimated 4m small cetaceans caught as by-catch in commercial tuna fishing nets since 1950, researchers say, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 11.39 EST\n\n, Dolphin numbers in the Indian Ocean may have dropped by more than 80% in recent decades, with an estimated 4m small cetaceans caught as “by-catch” in commercial tuna fishing nets since 1950, according to a study., As many as 100,000 cetaceans – mainly dolphins – were caught in commercial gill nets as by-catch in 2006, with current annual numbers at about 80,000., Published in the journal Endangered Species Research, the study used the changes in the numbers of dolphins caught in commercial gill nets as a way to calculate changes in the numbers of dolphins in the Indian Ocean., The authors say gill-net fishing in the Indian Ocean is “effectively unmanaged” and potentially the biggest unresolved issue facing cetaceans today., The study, led by Dr Charles Anderson of the Manta Marine organisation in the Maldives, estimated dolphin numbers had likely dropped to only 13% of their levels before 1980, when large-scale fishing efforts for tuna in the Indian Ocean began., Dr Puti Liza Mustika, a co-author of the study from James Cook University’s College of Business, Law and Governance, told Guardian Australia that most of the dolphins caught accidentally in gill nets did not get reported and were likely discarded over the side of boats., About a third of the tuna pulled from the Indian Ocean is caught in gill nets that hang in the water column – a method that has long concerned conservationists because as well as catching the valuable tuna, they also entangle other species including dolphins, whales, sharks and turtles., In the study, the authors acknowledge the estimates of the impacts on dolphins are “not definitive” and are “subject to much uncertainty”. There was no attempt to differentiate the different dolphin species impacted., But the authors added: “Nevertheless, they do highlight the potential impact of Indian Ocean gill-net fisheries on regional cetacean populations, and the need for much improved monitoring, mitigation and management.”, Mustika said some reliable data was available from observers on boats and from previous studies. While the study looked at all cetaceans – dolphins, porpoises and whales – the vast majority being caught were dolphins., “That by-catch number is alarming, but there are a lot of uncertainties because the datasets are insufficient,” Mustika said., Results taken from 10 programs to reliably count by-catch between 1981 and 2016 – carried out in Australia, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan – were used as the basis to extrapolate how many cetaceans were caught across all Indian Ocean fisheries covering 24 countries., Iran, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan were five countries catching the most tuna using gill nets. Together with Oman, Yemen, UAE and Tanzania, those nine countries accounted for almost all the dolphin by-catch., Iran and Indonesia did not report by-catch, Mustika said, while the limited figures that were available from other countries were likely unreliable., About 4.1 million small cetaceans had been caught between 1950 and 2018 in Indian Ocean gill nets., The study said Iran’s average annual catch of 214,262 tonnes of tuna – the greatest haul across the Indian Ocean gill-net fisheries – was likely catching 30,302 cetaceans a year.,  The study found that for every 1,000 tonnes of tuna currently being caught, about 175 cetaceans were also being caught., Mustika said the vast majority of those animals would die. “It’s a painful death. Dolphins are clever, but because the net is very thin in the water, the dolphins’ sonar misses them.”, She said the fishers should not be seen as “dolphin killers” and those she had spoken with were unhappy when dolphins became caught in their nets., The study said the by-catch estimates could also be too low. “These estimates do not include cetaceans that were caught by gill net but discarded at sea, used as bait and not landed, escaped from capture but subsequently died, or suffered significant sub-lethal impacts, caught in ghost nets or landed but not recorded.”, Mustika said solutions to the problem could include working with fishers to switch from the gill nets to other fishing gear, such as pole and line., There had also been trials using devices attached to the nets that deterred dolphins, including lights or devices that caused a rattling sound. Setting nets at shallower depths reduced the by-ctach but also reduced the amount of tuna being caught., “The solution has to be technology, as well as using fishing gears that are more sustainable,” Mustika said. “But banning these fishers is not a solution for developing countries.”, She said it was important to understand there was a “political reality” in the Indian Ocean, where hundreds of thousands of relatively poor fishermen and their families relied on the gill nets., The study authors also suggested that increased monitoring, better checks at ports and remote technologies could help bring by-catch numbers down.more than 80 of indian ocean dolphins may have been killed by commercial fishing study finds", "label": 0}, "train-422": {"text": "\nWorld's beaches disappearing due to climate crisis – study\n, UK on course to lose a quarter of its sandy coast because of human-driven erosion, \nStefano Valentino, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 11.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 3 Mar 2020 05.20 EST\n\n, Almost half of the world’s sandy beaches will have retreated significantly by the end of the century as a result of climate-driven coastal flooding and human interference, according to new research., The sand erosion will endanger wildlife and could inflict a heavy toll on coastal settlements that will no longer have buffer zones to protect them from rising sea levels and storm surges. In addition, measures by governments to mitigate against the damage are predicted to become increasingly expensive and in some cases unsustainable., In 30 years, erosion will have destroyed 36,097km (22,430 miles) or 13.6% of sandy coastlines identified from satellite images by scientists for the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European commission. They predict the situation will worsen in the second half of the century, washing away a further 95,061km or 25.7% of Earth’s beaches., These estimates are far from the most catastrophic; they rely on an optimistic forecast of international action to fight climate breakdown, a scenario known as RCP4.5. In this scenario of reduced ice-cap melting and lower thermal expansion of water, oceans will only have risen by 50cm by 2100., However, if the world continues to emit carbon at its current rate, sea levels will rise by an estimated 80cm, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If this happens, a total of 131,745km of beaches, or 13% of the planet’s ice-free coastline, will go under water., Around the globe, the average shoreline retreat will be 86.4 metres in the RCP4.5 scenario or 128.1 metres in the high-carbon scenario, though amounts will vary significantly between locations. Flatter or wilder coastlines will be more affected than those where waterfronts are steeper, or those artificially maintained as part of coastal development., In the best-case scenario, the UK will lose 1,531km or 27.7% of its sandy coast, and 2,415km (43.7%) in the worst case. Australia (14,849km lost) and Canada (14,425km) are predicted to be the worst-affected countries, followed by Chile (6,659km), Mexico (5,488km), China (5,440km) and the US (5,530km). The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau have short coastlines, but both are predicted to lose more than 60% of theirs., The study predicts that the hardest-hit areas in the UK will be west Dorset, north Devon, Great Yarmouth, Barrow-in-Furness and north-east Lincolnshire. In these areas, beach retreat is predicted to be five times the national average., “The length of threatened seashores incorporates locations that will be submerged by more than 100 metres, assuming there are no physical limits to potential retreat,” said Michalis Vousdoukas, an oceanographer at the JRC and lead author of the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change. “Our 100-metre threshold is conservative since most beaches’ width is below 50 metres, especially near human settlements and in small islands, such as the Caribbean and the Mediterranean.”, Large beaches will narrow by 100-200 metres on Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the Australian side of the Indian Ocean, wiping out more than 60% of sand deposits in a number of developing countries that are economically fragile and heavily dependent on coastal tourism., But swift action to limit emissions and fight climate breakdown could help reduce the impact, experts say. “Moderate emissions mitigation could prevent 17% of the shoreline retreat in 2050 and 40% in 2100, thus preserving on average 42 metres of sand between land and sea,” Vousdoukas said., The researchers projected the future anthropogenic and geological changes based on 30 years of observations., Sea-level rise is exacerbating problems caused by construction and barriers on the shoreline such as buildings, roads or dams, which have changed the natural replenishment cycle of sandy beaches., “In the UK, part of manmade erosion results from protecting cliffs whose wearing would normally top up the associated beaches with gravel,” said Robert Nicholls, the director of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. “This happens, for example, in Bournemouth, to safeguard luxury properties built on top of fancy viewpoints.”, In some regions such as the Baltic, marine erosion is compensated by land rise. Sediments may also be brought by rivers, either naturally as in the Amazon, or resulting from artificial activities as in the Chinese deltas that accumulate residues from industrial sites upstream., A third driver of erosion is the intensification of storms, which is associated with climate breakdown. These look on course to further erode the most vulnerable beaches; the study predicts that the British seashores facing most erosion are the east and west coasts, which are more exposed to tidal surges than the south., By the end of the century up to 63% of low-lying coastal regions worldwide will be threatened. In these areas, both population density and development tend to be higher than inland., “Seaward human expansion will continue, mostly in unspoiled coastlines that are particularly extensive in Asia and Africa,” Vousdoukas said. “Adaptive measures are urgently needed.”, In many places, the cost of protecting the shoreline often outweighs the benefits. For example, in 2017 a £62m sea wall was built to protect the tourist resort of Blackpool. Besides requiring indefinite spending on maintenance, such concrete defences are seen as more of a problem than a solution as they can disrupt the process by which sand is deposited by ocean currents, exacerbating erosion., In some places the Environmental Agency has chosen to replenish beaches with sand dredged offshore. Not only is this harmful to marine habitats, mining sand from the seabed is expensive. Since 1994 millions of pounds have been spent yearly to replenish the 20km seafront between Skegness and Mablethorpe in Lincolnshire, also helping to preserve 35,000 hectares of farmland., Dr Sally Brown, deputy head of life and environmental sciences at Bournemouth University, said: “Building defences helps maintain coastline position, but defences are known to reduce beach width or depth over multiple decades. Responding to sea-level rise means looking strategically at how and where we defend coasts today, which may mean protecting only limited parts of the coast., “Beach nourishment schemes can help the problem, such as in Bournemouth, but these beaches need a regular top-up. Ultimately, we cannot nourish everywhere for ever, meaning that hard decisions need to be made about how much to spend and how to manage the coast in decades to come. This could affect those living on the coast, and tourists who enjoy the sandy beaches too. Sea-level rise will only make this situation worse.”, • An interactive map showing beaches that will lose or gain ground can be found here.world sandy beaches disappearing due to climate crisis study", "label": 0}, "train-423": {"text": "\nRich countries could be asked to pay billions to protect biodiversity\n, NGOs express disappointment with ambition of UN talks on global nature agreement, \nPatrick Greenfield in Rome, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 08.13 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 08.32 EST\n\n, Wealthy nations could be asked to make significant financial contributions to biodiverse countries such as Brazil under proposals put forward during talks on a global agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity decline., Paying countries with life-sustaining ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest billions of pounds a year for the services those ecosystems provide for the world was proposed during negotiations on a Paris-style UN agreement on nature in Rome last week. , Conservationists hope the eventual agreement will provide an accessible, science-based global goal on biodiversity loss, equivalent to targets to limit global heating, following warnings from scientists that humans are driving the sixth mass extinction event in Earth’s history., Delegates from more than 140 countries were responding for the first time to a draft 20-point agreement that includes proposals to protect almost a third of the world’s oceans and land and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%., Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms and all its interactions.  “Without biodiversity, there is no future for humanity,” says Prof David Macdonald, at Oxford University. It is comprised of several levels, starting with genes, then individual species, then communities of creatures and finally entire ecosystems, such as forests or coral reefs, where life interplays with the physical environment. , Without plants there would be no oxygen and without bees to pollinate there would be no fruit or nuts. The services provided by ecosystems are estimated to be worth trillions of dollars – double the world’s GDP. Biodiversity loss in Europe alone is estimated to cost the continent about 3% of its GDP, or €450m (£400m), a year., The extinction rate of species is now thought to be about 1,000 times higher than before humans dominated the planet, which may be even faster than the losses after a giant meteorite wiped out the dinosaurs 65m years ago. The sixth mass extinction in geological history has already begun, according to some scientists. Billions of individual populations have been lost, with the number of animals living on Earth having plunged by half since 1970. Researchers call the massive loss of wildlife a “biological annihilation”. , Changes to the climate are reversible, even if that takes centuries or millennia – but once species become extinct, there’s no going back., During the talks at the Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome, several African and Latin American countries expressed the need for financial support to protect life-supporting ecosystems and develop mechanisms to share profits from discoveries linked to their genetic resources, such as new drugs., The negotiating team for Brazil, led by Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde, was particularly robust about the need for financial payments for ecosystem services., Small-scale schemes to protect ecosystems already exist under the UN climate convention, with countries with large forests receiving payments to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation., When asked whether obtaining sufficient financial backing from developed nations for so-called mega biodiverse countries would be the key sticking point in the agreement, senior UN officials cautioned that negotiations were ongoing but said the targets would not be implemented without resources., Francis Ogwal, a co-chair of the negotiations, said: “When you’re talking about biodiversity, it’s not just biodiversity, it’s our life on this planet. If the loss of biodiversity continues at this pace, human beings won’t be on this planet., “It’s about us assuring our survival here and for generations to come. So really, on that basis, why wouldn’t more money be put there? It’s for our own good.”, Countries with high biodiversity include China, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and India, according to various definitions. The payments would support poorer countries with high biodiversity to help conserve life-supporting ecosystems., This week’s talks had been scheduled to be held in the Chinese city of Kunming, and governments are expected to adopt the agreement at a summit there in October, replacing targets for the previous decade that countries largely failed to meet., The negotiations were moved to Rome following the outbreak of the new coronavirus, and the Chinese delegation was not able to attend due to quarantine measures. The planned Kunming agreement has been highlighted as the first time China is taking the lead on environmental global issues, and UN officials said officials had been in contact from afar., Another co-chair, Basile van Havre, said: “In terms of China’s engagement with the discussions, I don’t know how many hundreds of WeChat messages I’ve exchanged with Beijing and the delegation here. Their team were up during our schedule, listening and engaging.”, Despite warm words from some negotiators, many NGOs expressed disappointment with the ambition of the talks and the level of urgency following the first round of negotiations., Marco Lambertini, the director general of WWF International, said: “Our relationship with nature is dangerously unbalanced. One million species are threatened with extinction and the way we currently produce and consume is risking irreparable damage to the very natural systems that underpin human wellbeing and prosperity, from forests to oceans and river systems. With science and society calling for urgent action on nature, alongside climate, it is disappointing to see limited ambition and leadership displayed by countries in Rome., “The world must not miss the chance this year’s UN talks provide to secure a Paris-style agreement for nature that includes a clear 2030 set of science-based and measurable goals and targets. It will now be critical that countries step up to the challenge in the next round of negotiations and ensure the draft agreement arrives in Kunming with the necessary ambition to deliver a nature-positive world by the end of the decade.”, At the World Economic Forum at the start of this year, biodiversity loss was highlighted as the third biggest risk to the world in terms of likelihood and severity., The next round of formal negotiations will be held in Cali, Colombia, in July., Additional reporting by Sam Cowie.rich countries could be asked to pay billions to protect biodiversity aoe", "label": 0}, "train-424": {"text": "\nTranquil setting and a seafood meal plan: the retirement home for whales\n, \nTranquil setting and a seafood meal plan: the retirement home for whales\n, Group of ageing beluga whales and orcas from marine entertainment parks will live out their post-showbiz days in a sheltered bay off Canada, \nLeyland Cecco, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 06.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 06.03 EST\n\n, More than 300 beluga whales and 60 orcas remain captive in aquariums around the world, with recent films such as Blackfish highlighting the ethics of breeding them for entertainment., The stress can be even more dire for ageing whales that are no longer able to perform for audiences but remain doomed to live out their days in captivity., Now, however, one group of ageing beluga whales and orcas might soon enjoy their golden years in style, part of a groundbreaking whale retirement community in Canada that promises tranquil waters – and a meal plan heavy on the fish., The Whale Sanctuary Project, a US-based organisation, announced this week it had selected a small town in eastern Canada as the testing grounds for its first sanctuary to resettle whales leaving the performance world., “Their quality of life can be a whole lot better than it is in the entertainment parks,” said Dr Lori Marino, the group’s founder. “But they don’t have the survival skills to just be dumped back in the ocean., “The sanctuary is much closer to their natural habitat than the way they’re living now.”, The organisation looked for roughly 40 hectares (100 acres) of sheltered bay, resistant to storms and frigid temperatures. After scouring North America for a suitable location, including sites off the coast of British Columbia and Washington state, the organisation chose Port Hilford, a coastal community 124 miles north of Halifax, Nova Scotia., The sanctuary would involve running a net along the mouth of the inlet, enclosing the area. The currents there are strong enough to allow a constant flow of water, and the bay teems with marine life., Given that the whales have spent their lives in captivity and would probably suffer immense stress upon release into the wild, the Whale Sanctuary Project plans to feed the whales, as well as providing on-site medical care., If all goes according to plan – pending approvals from the provincial and federal levels of Canadian government and nearly $15m (£11m) in investment – as many as eight beluga whales could swim the waters off Nova Scotia’s eastern shore in 2021., The area is sparsely populated, but the community there has been eager to make it work. “These are people who really get it,” said Marino. “We’ve been struck by how they’ve opened their hearts.”, As interest in aquariums wanes and marine parks face mounting backlash, hundreds of whales will inevitably need to find a home in the coming years., “I worked with captive dolphins and beluga whales when I was a student. It wasn’t until I actually saw them in the wild that I realised who they were,” said Marino. “They don’t belong in concrete tanks. They need to have the ocean and all its variety and challenges to really thrive.”, In June, Canada passed the “Free Willy bill” banning the trade, possession, capture and breeding of cetaceans. Although two facilities will be permitted to keep existing species in captivity – a Pacific white-sided dolphin at the Vancouver Aquarium, and a lone orca, Kiska, and more than 50 beluga whales at Marineland in Niagara Falls – neither is permitted to breed or acquire more animals., The Whale Sanctuary Project has reached out to marine parks across the continent with the hope of working together to create a new way of thinking about sanctuaries., “Belugas don’t have their own Blackfish movie, so they’re easy to forget about. But there are so many of them in those tanks, not doing well,” Marino said., “This is about moving the needle and showing the next generation that there’s another way to relate to whales,” she said. “They’re not performers and commodities.

But they still refuse to commit to what scientists say is necessary if the US is to rapidly cut back on burning fossil fuels., A recent package of legislation proposed by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy would encourage capturing climate pollutants from power plants but use them to drill for oil., It would also lead to the planting of a trillion trees to absorb carbon emissions but also ramp up logging, an idea Donald Trump has endorsed., “It’s greenwashing,” said Randi Spivak, public lands director at the Center for Biological Diversity, which organized a letter of opposition on the tree bill from dozens of environment groups to the House natural resources committee., “The science is very clear,” Spivak said. “We need to slash our carbon pollution by 50% over the next 10 years if we want to avert the worst impacts of global warming and keep global warming to a 1.5C increase.”, The Republican party has seen a pendulum swing. In 2008, its election platform emphasized the importance of cutting emissions. By 2016, Donald Trump ran on a campaign of climate denial., Now at least some prominent Republicans are breaking from the president and veering away from questioning the science and toward efforts that do not directly attack the coal, oil and gas industries. Facing pushback from the far right, on the other side of the aisle they are criticized by some Democrats who believe they are not proposing legislation in good faith., Even someone who’s not a forester should be able to recognize an olive branch when they see one, Alex Flint, executive director of the Alliance for Market Solutions – a right-of-center organization that advocates reducing carbon pollution while growing the US economy – said the House bills were “directionally correct” but “need to grow to address the scale of our climate problem”., Flint’s group backs revenue-neutral carbon tax and deregulation., “I give House Republicans a great deal of credit for acknowledging the problem and stepping forward with proposals and recognizing that the politics of this has changed,” he said. “But also acknowledging that they are in the early stages of really substantive climate proposals.”, Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican who introduced the trees bill, insisted his proposal would curb emissions even as it promotes logging., When trees are cut down, they stop absorbing carbon. Westerman, a forester who worked for an engineering consulting firm in the timber, pulp and paper business, said forest managers would just plant them again., Products made from the trees would pay for continual planting, he said, and the wood would be used for sustainable buildings with lower emissions footprints., A scientist called to testify by Democrats, Yale ecology professor Carla Staver, strongly disagreed with Westerman’s proposals., Forest management is an important way to fight climate change but it is not enough and it must be done properly, experts agree. A bill from Democrats would aim to conserve forests without increasing logging and by banning oil and gas drilling on public lands if climate emissions exceed targets., Westerman told the Guardian Democrats should be working with Republicans who want to address climate change., “Even someone who’s not a forester should be able to recognize an olive branch when they see one,” he said., Even as Westerman defended his bill, the top Republican on his committee seemed to dismiss the overall effort., At the beginning of the meeting, to which he was late, Rob Bishop of Utah suggested the elevators in House office buildings would be more timely under the rule of Benito Mussolini than they are with Democrats in charge. Democratic climate proposals, he said, offered not a “silver bullet” to fix the problem but “another bullet that is going to be used to shoot ourselves in the foot”., He then showed a graph demonstrating how US heat-trapping emissions have declined over time., While the Republican bills are far from aggressive, the right of the party is pushing back. The conservative Club for Growth Pac painted the package as “stifling liberal environmental taxes, regulations, and subsidies” and vowed to withhold support from any backers., At the annual CPAC gathering near Washington, the climate change denial group the Heartland Institute presented a German teen activist who calls herself a “climate sceptic” as a foil to Greta Thunberg., In Oregon, Republican state senators fled the state capitol in order to derail a climate change bill., Despite that backdrop, the top Democrat on the House natural resources committee welcomed Westerman’s proposal. Raúl Grijalva said he hoped for a “new chapter”, focusing on solutions not denial., He said: “For too long my friends on the other side of aisle denied that this was even a real issue.

Campaigners fear that preparations are being hampered by both the travel restrictionsand the urgent demands the outbreak is putting on governments’ time and resources., China, the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, is the key player in the climate talks. As the US is withdrawing from the Paris accord, whether or not China takes on strong new commitments on carbon will help determine whether Cop26 (the conference of the parties) is a success. But with the coronavirus taking hold across the country, the climate is likely be much less of a priority., Italy also plays a vital role in this year’s talks as the country is officially co-host of Cop26 and some key pre-meetings are planned there., Normally, at this stage before crunch climate talks, officials and politicians from the host nation would be convening meetings in key countries., Campaigners were already concerned that the UK had got off to a slow start, because the first Cop26 president, Claire O’Neill, was abruptly sacked, and her replacement – the business secretary, Alok Sharma – only appointed two weeks ago. The UK has still not set out a strategy or timetable for Cop26 or for its own goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050., Tom Burke, the co-founder of the environmental group E3G and a longtime observer of the talks, said the preparations were already being affected. For the Cop26 talks to succeed “you need to generate much more momentum, you have to have diplomacy that is much more aggressive”, he said. The coronavirus “is already having an impact and if it gets much worse, there will be a more significant impact”., China would be distracted from the talks, predicted Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House and a strategic adviser to the Progressive Policy Institute in the US., “The challenge for the Cop leadership is to act prudently as organisers, while also retaining appropriate attention on the climate emergency itself, which after all is likely to make infectious disease a far bigger problem in much of the world,” he said. “Should coronavirus become a full-scale pandemic, holding anything like a traditional Cop might quickly become impossible.”, Nat Keohane, a senior vice-president of the US Environmental Defense Fund, said a key meeting in Bonn, Germany, in early June could be hit, and bilateral meetings between the UK, the EU and other key players might also be affected., However, people with experience of the talks also said the UK and the UN would take advantage of communications technology to carry on with diplomatic preparations. At the Paris talks, negotiators held regular confabs on Facebook and other forms of social media, and have active WhatsApp groups. Videoconferencing is also increasingly used., These technologies have the advantages of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from travel. Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, said using virtual meetings could be “an unintended benefit”., The Cabinet Office, which is leading on Cop26 for the UK government, said: “The summit is still many months away but we’re monitoring the situation closely. Our officials are attending all planned engagements. But we are aware that this is an issue which may affect some international travel and will adapt our plans accordingly, to ensure necessary discussions and diplomacy with international partners can continue.”, The European commission said there had been “no significant impact for the time being” on Cop26 preparations but the EU and China were “maintaining contacts via videoconferencing and through diplomatic channels at various levels. We are still hopeful and committed to the summits foreseen this year and will work closely with the Chinese government to this effect.” Travel is also continuing to unaffected areas around the world., Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, a developing world thinktank, contrasted the rapid global response to the virus with sluggish attempts to stave off climate breakdown. “The response to Covid-19 has been drastic and urgent, as it should be,” he said. “The fact they can act this decisively to stop the Covid-19 crisis exposes their slow reaction to the climate crisis is not one of capacity, but a lack of political will.”vital cop26 climate talks could be derailed by coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-427": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a jewel-eyed destroyer infests the knapweed\n, Romaldkirk, Teesdale: One common name for this plant is hardheads and thanks to picture-winged fly larvae some heads are harder than others, \nPhil Gates, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, When I walked this stretch of the Tees Valley railway path last summer, the purple “shaving brush” flowers of common knapweed, Centaurea nigra, swarmed with bees, butterflies and hoverflies. It’s an ecologically important element of our native flora, so familiar that over 50 local names have been recorded for it, from iron knobs (Cheshire) to lady’s cushion (Kent). It’s also a useful plant for a wildlife-friendly garden. So, on a bitterly cold February day, I went back to collect seeds., I was almost too late: many seed heads had been shredded by hungry birds. Others, that were still intact, bore telltale signs of infestation by larvae of an intriguing little insect called Chaetostomella cylindrica, one of the family of flies called tephritids. Commonly known as picture-winged flies, these tiny fruit flies feed on knapweed seeds., An alternative name for this plant is hardheads and some are harder than others, making the larvae easy to locate. Just give the seed heads a gentle squeeze between finger and thumb; if it feels as though there is a small nut inside, there will be fly larvae, protected by a tough gall., Back home, I cut into the base of a gall and split it by twisting the knife. And there they were: barrel-shaped white grubs with flat black heads, grown fat encased in their woody chamber, waiting for spring. This year it arrived early for some, which I had put in a jam jar., Soon I noticed small flies running around inside the glass. Under a hand lens, they were exquisite. Tephritid species each have distinctive wing patterns, and these were decorated with smoky brown bands, but it was their multifaceted compound eyes that captivated, flashing iridescent green, gold and purple as they crawled out into daylight for the first time., Insects like this jewel-like seed destroyer, waving its wings at me as I watched, can make the difference between a plant being labelled as a wildflower or a weed. In the late 19th century, Centaurea maculosa, the European spotted knapweed, another of this fly’s food plants, was accidentally introduced into North America but left its tephritid predators at home.

But we still think that we have lost two out of every three koalas in NSW. It’s a spectacular loss in terms of conservation criteria and meets endangered listing almost immediately.”, The study looked at declines of koala populations over three generations – about 18 years – and included the effect of the fires from 1 October 2019 to 10 January 2020., Losses were estimated to be between 29% and 67%, with further analysis to be completed covering the fires up to 10 February., “We realised the numbers lost were getting quite dire, but we also appreciated there was a need for a careful quantitative assessment of what’s happened,” Phillips said., The study examined previous estimates of koala populations. It found that in 2012 there were about 54,284 koalas in NSW. Before the fires hit, three generations of koalas’ numbers had fallen by about 20%., The study looked at more than 100 fires, including multiple areas within those regions previously identified by the NSW government as holding key populations, known as “areas of regional koala significance” or Arks., Areas around Port Macquarie, on the NSW north coast, and the Sydney basin had been particularly hard hit., Koalas are susceptible to major impacts such as fires because they reproduce relatively slowly, with each female able to produce only a maximum of one joey each year., Phillips said this reproduction rate depended on adequate food supplies and no other disturbances., He added that climate change reports suggested conditions would get worse for koalas, with continued stress on the eucalypts they rely on for food, as well as increasing risks from bushfires., “The situation won’t get better. It will get worse,” he said. “For koalas, the threat for extinction in NSW becomes elevated because they won’t be able to get their numbers up before the next fire event.”, Josey Sharrad, a wildlife campaigner at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said the state was facing a “koala emergency”. , “They’re an iconic species here and globally, and it’s unthinkable that we could be at serious risk of losing them in NSW.”, On Tuesday Ifaw wrote to the NSW threatened species committee and the environment minister, Matt Kean, to ask that koalas be “emergency uplisted” to endangered status., Humane Society International, Port Macquarie koala hospital and Friends of the Koala also signed the request. An emergency listing could last for two years while further assessments were carried out., Elaine Johnson, principal lawyer at the Environmental Defenders Office in Sydney, which advised Ifaw on available steps to protect koalas, said a provisional endangered listing would put further restrictions on development applications that affected on koalas and in some cases could stop developments., “In our view the report provides a strong basis for a provisional listing,” Johnson said. “Importantly, the report looks at the ongoing threats from climate change and those risks are likely to increase., “We think it’s the right time to provide further protections for koalas.”, Guardian Australia requested a comment from Kean. A NSW government statement said it had reconvened an independent expert advisory panel to support the state’s koala strategy.,  “This season’s significant bushfires have resulted in devastating losses to koala numbers across NSW and may have compounded their vulnerable status, so it is imperative that remaining populations and habitat are protected,” it said., “Although there is no firm estimate of the number of koalas affected by the recent fires, at this stage, approximately one-quarter of the modelled koala habitat in eastern NSW is within the fire-affected area.”, Drones with thermal sensors were being used to help estimate koala populations. The planning, industry and environment department had met with the chair and deputy chair of the NSW threatened species scientific committee “to discuss the immediate impact on our animals, plants and ecosystems, and the need for species assessment and longer term recovery”., “The department is undertaking an analysis of the impacts of the recent fires across the state, so we can determine the impact where the greatest impacts on wildlife and native vegetation,” the statement said., In an unrelated announcement on Tuesday, Kean said $150,000 would go to organisations in the northern rivers and far south coast for six koala habitat restorations projects, “which include planting 50,000 koala feed tree seedlings”., bushfires likely to have killed about 5000 koalas in nsw report finds", "label": 0}, "train-429": {"text": "\nClimate nightmares: how to reassure a child who is anxious about the planet\n, One in five children aged eight to 16 have nightmares about the state of the world. Here’s how adults can help, \nSam Wollaston, \n\nTue 3 Mar 2020 11.03 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 3 Mar 2020 13.28 EST\n\n, What’s going to happen? Is everyone going to die? Questions that come up a bit in our house, from a concerned eight-year-old. In the past weeks, the focus of the anxiety might have been on you-know-what-19, but before then it was all about the future of the planet., It is no massive surprise then that a survey for BBC Newsround has found that one in five kids have nightmares about the climate crisis. Or that two-fifths of the 2,000 children polled (aged eight to 16) don’t trust adults to sort it out., David Spellman, a clinical psychologist who works with children, thinks there might be a bit more out there in the ether of digital media to trigger kids’ fear; that the coverage can be a bit hysterical (a common question put to experts is: how worried should we be?); and in Greta Thunberg there is someone kids can relate and listen to. Even so, children have always had catastrophic fears. “In my day – I’m 56 – it was about nuclear war,” Spellman says. “That was something that was bewildering, but felt real.”, He thinks adults can have the romantic notion that childhood is worry-free, but notes that we have become more aware of what children worry about, take it more seriously and are more open in understanding it. It need not be crippling., Listening is key. “The danger is we dive in to lecture and advise rather than listen. It’s important to find ways to communicate, make sure they can talk about stuff,” says Spellman. And help them to become active consumers of information, to raise questions, ask what – and who – can be trusted. “I quite like the current trend for fact-checking people,” he adds., “When you’re talking about huge things, like the climate and disease, the overwhelming scale of these things is apparent to everyone,” says Spellman. “The small things they can do to make a difference is often helpful.” So, if the worry leads not to being unable to get out of bed, but to taking some kind of effective action, then that is maybe not so bad. climate nightmares how to reassure a child who is anxious about the planet", "label": 0}, "train-430": {"text": "\nBrazilian meat companies linked to farmer charged with 'massacre' in Amazon\n, Investigation traces meat sold to JBS and rival Marfrig to farm owned by man implicated in Mato Grosso killings, \nDom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro, \n\nTue 3 Mar 2020 08.31 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 7 Mar 2020 05.52 EST\n\n, A new investigation has linked the world’s biggest meat company JBS, and its rival Marfrig, to a farm whose owner is implicated in one of the most brutal Amazonian massacres in recent memory., The report by Repórter Brasil comes as JBS faces growing pressure over transparency failings in its Amazon cattle supply chain., On 19 April 2017, nine men were brutally murdered in what became known as the “Colniza massacre”. The men had been squatting on remote forest land in the state of Mato Grosso when their bodies were found, according to court documents. Some showed signs of torture; some had been stabbed, others shot., According to charges filed by state prosecutors in Mato Grosso, the massacre was carried out by a gang known as “the hooded ones”. The aim, they said, was to terrify locals, take over land they lived on and extract valuable natural resources. The first reporter to reach the lawless, far-flung region only got there a week later., On 15 May 2017, prosecutors said they had charged Valdelir João de Souza, a farmer who owned two timber companies on neighbouring land, and four others with homicide and forming or being part of an illegal paramilitary group. Prosecutors said de Souza had ordered the massacre, although he had not been present when it occurred. , Since then de Souza has been a fugitive. But in April 2018 two adjacent areas of land – Três Lagoas and Piracama farms - in nearby Rondônia state were registered under his name (one of the oddities of the Brazilian property system is that landowners register their own land and boundaries). The two farms covered 1,052 hectares (2,599 acres) in an area set aside by the government for low-income agricultural workers. Satellite images show extensive deforestation on the Três Lagoas farm in 2015. , Government sanitary records seen by Repórter Brasil show that on 9 May 2018 143 cattle were sold by the Três Lagoas and Piracama farms to a farm owned by Maurício Narde., Minutes later Narde’s farm sold 143 animals of the same sex and age – 80 female cattle between 13– 24 months old and 63 female cattle over 36 months old – to a JBS meatpacker., In June 2017, according to court documents in a separate case, Narde worked at a sawmill owned by de Souza in Machadinho d’Oeste in Rondônia state. He still works at the same sawmill, although it has since changed its name and is no longer controlled by de Souza. Reached by telephone by the Guardian, Narde confirmed the transaction but did not explain why he had sold the cattle after buying them minutes beforehand.“We buy and sell, just to keep things moving,” he said, before deciding not to answer any more questions and concluding the interview., The quick sale of the cattle suggests what environmentalists call “cattle laundering” – when cattle from a farm that has environmental issues sells cattle to a “clean” farm. This gets around monitoring systems because meat companies including JBS do not monitor these “indirect suppliers”., “This series of coincidences suggests a common practice, which is the triangulation of animals,” said Mauro Armelin, director of Friends of the Earth Brazil. “It is a practice that could indicate cattle laundering.”, On 25 June 2018, according to government sanitary records, Três Lagoas also sold 153 head of cattle to the Morro Alto farm in Monte Negro, Rondônia, owned by José Carlos de Albuquerque., In the following months de Albuquerque sold dozens of head of cattle to JBS and Marfrig slaughterhouses., De Albuquerque told Réporter Brasil that the sale had never been completed – but the report cited sanitary records showing the cattle had, in fact, entered the Morro Alto farm. Contacted by the Guardian by phone and email, he declined to answer questions., The Repórter Brasil investigation highlights the difficulties that Brazil’s big meat companies have in monitoring their supply chains., JBS and other big companies such as Marfrig committed to not buying from farms involved in illegal deforestation in two separate agreements signed with Greenpeace and Brazilian prosecutors in 2009 and subsequent years. Under the Greenpeace deal, the companies also promised to remove producers accused of land grabbing or convicted in rural conflicts from their suppliers lists. The deal with federal prosecutors similarly bans farms that have been convicted of involvement in rural conflicts, or that are being investigated., Greenpeace quit their deal in 2017, after JBS was fined for buying cattle from farms in illegally-deforested areas in the Amazon state of Pará. An audit by federal prosecutors found that 19% of the cattle JBS purchased in the state in 2016 had “evidence of irregularities”., In the years following the cattle agreement, JBS made enormous progress in improving its monitoring of Amazon suppliers and the company defended its sustainability in a statement., “We monitor over 280,000 square miles, an area larger than Germany, and assess more than 50,000 potential cattle-supplying farms every day, as well as conducting daily checks of all purchases to ensure compliance with strict standards. To date we have blocked more than 8,000 cattle-supplying farms due to noncompliance,” it said., But while the company now has a complex system in place to monitor its direct suppliers, it is still unable to monitor its indirect suppliers – those farmers who sell to farms that then sell on to JBS., De Souza’s case has yet to be concluded. Ulisses Rabaneda, a lawyer representing de Souza, told the Guardian that he had decided not to reply to questions from the media at this stage in the court proceedings. , In an interview with the Gazeta Digital in 2019, de Souza said he was innocent of all charges, had never been involved in death squads, and remained a fugitive because he was scared he would be murdered by the real killers if he handed himself in., “I never went around armed, so why at my age of 41, with solid companies, a peaceful life, no debts, without any problems, would I do something so barbaric?” de Souza said in the interview. “I built everything with the honesty and effort of my family. Why would I throw it all away?”, JBS told Réporter Brasil that de Souza was not a supplier and that it does not “acquire cattle from farms involved in deforestation of native forests, invasion of indigenous reserves of conservation, rural violence, land conflicts, or that used slave or child labour”., “JBS reiterates that any attempt to link the company to the person mentioned in the report, who was never on its list of suppliers, is irresponsible,” the company told the Guardian., Marfrig declined to comment on the investigation and sent the statement it had previously sent to the Guardian in December in which the company recognised that 53% of its Amazon cattle comes from indirect suppliers., “Marfrig is fully aware of the challenges related to the livestock production chain and recognises its role as an important transformation agent to ensure production vis-à-vis the conservation of Brazilian biomes, especially the Amazon,” the company said.,  It detailed measures including a supplier monitoring platform and its Request for Information (RFI) tool, in which suppliers voluntarily list the farms they may have acquired animals from. The company says a third of the cattle it sources in the Amazon come with an RFI, and it is now working to improve the process with World Wildlife Fund., In 2017, a Greenpeace report published after the Colniza massacre said a company owned by de Souza, called Madeireira Cedroarana, had accumulated around $150,000 (£116,000) in unpaid fines over a decade from Brazil’s environment agency, Ibama., Between January 2016 and October 2017 the company exported thousands of cubic metres of timber to the US and Europe. In 2018 it changed its name to Colmar Madeiras; it continues at the same address, but de Souza is no longer its controlling partner. In the interview with Gazeta Digital, he said his company had challenged fines it had received., The headline to this article was amended on 6 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the contents of the articlebrazilian meat companies linked to farmer charged with massacre in amazon", "label": 0}, "train-431": {"text": "\nEU member states call for 2030 climate target\n, Dozen member states hope letter will focus minds before Glasgow UN talks this year, \nJennifer Rankin in Brussels, \n\nTue 3 Mar 2020 05.49 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 3 Mar 2020 12.30 EST\n\n, A dozen countries have called for an EU climate target for 2030 to be drawn up “as soon as possible”, if the bloc is to galvanise the rest of the world before vital UN talks in Glasgow later this year., In a letter to the EU’s top official on climate action, Frans Timmermans, the dozen EU member states say “the EU can lead by example and contribute to creating the international momentum needed for all parties to scale up their ambition” by adopting a 2030 EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction target “as soon as possible and by June 2020 at the latest”., This year’s UN talks in Glasgow are crucial, as the world is far adrift of goals set at the landmark 2015 Paris conference, including the aspiration to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Even half a degree higher will significantly increase the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for millions of people., The letter piles pressure on Timmermans, who is due to unveil the EU’s long-awaited climate law on Wednesday. A leaked draft of the law shows Timmermans’ plans to propose an EU-wide 2030 target by September. The target would probably be an emissions reduction of 50-55% compared with 1990 levels, which green activists say is not enough to guarantee meeting the EU’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050., EU officials think a couple of months’ difference in proposing the target makes little difference, but would allow them to bring onboard more reluctant countries, including Poland, which has not yet signed up to the EU-wide goal of net zero emissions by mid-century., The climate and environment ministers argue timing is crucial, as they want the EU to have a 2030 target, before an EU-China summit in September and well ahead of Glasgow climate talks in November. “No other major economy is prepared to take the lead to ensure an ambitious implementation of the Paris agreement,” they write., Wendel Trio, the director of the Climate Action Network Europe, said: “By proposing a 2030 target increase only in September, the commission will give member states no time to reach an agreement by Cop26 in November, the international deadline by which all countries must commit to new, ambitious climate pledges for 2030. The EU needs to have its own house in order, and quickly to push other countries to make substantial contributions well before the deadline.”, The letter, organised by Denmark, was also signed by France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. Only two signatories – Slovenia and Latvia – are central and eastern countries that joined the EU after 2004. Germany is conspicuous by its absence., The EU climate law is the centrepiece of the European Green Deal, which aims to transform Europe’s economy to confront the climate emergency. The law could set Brussels on a collision course with populist governments in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which have been the slowest moving on the climate emergency. Putting the 2050 net zero target into law means Poland could be outvoted if it continued to refuse to sign up., The European Green Deal is the EU’s answer to what the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the “existential issue” of the climate emergency. Most EU countries have signed up to goal of a climate neutral EU by 2050, a goal demanding dramatic change in energy use, farming, housing, transport, trade and diplomacy., The European Green Deal is only the start of the journey: laws will have to be drafted and agreed by EU ministers and MEPs; money will have to be raised; plans will have to be implemented. It is a route map, rather than a destination, and time is running out., Under the law, Brussels would also be able to take a government lagging behind on its climate target to the European court of justice, which can issue daily fines for failure to uphold EU law., Poland, which generates 80% of its electricity from coal, is seeking EU funds to help wean its economy from fossil fuels. The European commission has proposed a €100m (£87m) “just transition” fund to help countries with coal mining jobs adjust to a green economy, but Warsaw has yet to come onboard., Climate activists have accused the commission of lacking ambition, as the climate law gives scant detail on how the EU will meet the 2050 net zero target, either by phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, reforming the EU’s common agricultural policy or regulating industry., “With no 2030 climate target and no measures to end subsidies for fossil fuels, industrial farming and other destructive industries, the commission has left a big hole in what’s meant to be the flagship of the European Green Deal,” said Sebastian Mang, a climate and energy policy adviser at Greenpeace., The Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is likely to give her verdict on the EU climate plans when she meets MEPs on Wednesday.

Partly on the basis of productivity, I’d suggest the queen buff-tailed bumblebee that visited our purple crocuses yesterday., Over the summer this single insect might have more than 1,000 children (spare a thought, perhaps, for the ultimate social-insect matriarch: the Dorylus ant queen who can give birth to 300m offspring and have 5m around her at any one time)., Yet it’s not fertility alone that inspires my admiration. As I look out this morning, the garden is blurred with incessant rain and the temperature has dropped from 18C to 6C. Hopefully the bee is hunkered down in a nest, but to succeed she must lay about a dozen eggs and, when they hatch after four days, provide her emerging daughters – the so-called “workers” – with pollen and nectar. As well as constantly restocking these foodstuffs, the queen must also lay her abdomen over them to generate heat, keeping the brood at roughly 30C for them to develop properly., Bear in mind that possibly eight out of 10 queens don’t even come through the rigours of hibernation, and that only one in 100 may be successful at founding a colony, and you begin to understand the allocation of heroic status., There are, however, further factors in my choice. All around her thorax the queen bore a belt of granular pink, but these unpleasant-looking pimples were not her own anatomy but an infestation of phoretic mites, probably Parasitellus. Having overwintered with our heroine, these mites will then infest her brood and live off its rich pickings., Perhaps most admirable of the queen’s qualities is that she can fly at all. The energetics of bumblebees are nothing short of astonishing. In his 1996 book The Thermal Warriors: Strategies of Insect Survival, the wonderful American biologist and ultramarathon runner Bernd Heinrich compared their metabolism to a human jogger’s, who uses the calorific contents of a Mars bar in an hour. This queen, were she of human size, would burn 120 bars in every 60 minutes of flying time.country diary the mother of all queen bee heroines", "label": 0}, "train-433": {"text": "The Frontline: experts answer your questions on the impacts of the climate emergency – as it happened, To mark the end of The Frontline series a panel of experts answer your questions about the climate crisis and how it is affecting Australia. , Ask Prof Lesley Hughes, Greg Mullins, Prof Michael Mann and Assoc Prof Donna Green your questions, and see the answers on our live blog.

But we did manage to answer:, \n\n11.14pm EST\n23:14\n\n, Our final question for today, from Emma Coats:, When do you feel optimistic that we can keep this planet in OK shape for our kids and grandkids? Is it when you read that demand for coal will be in freefall within a decade or is it when you read that more and more people are demanding action from governments? What makes you feel optimistic?, Donna Green:, I have a (possibly unrealistic) ability to entertain the notion that people can be simultaneously incredibly smart and incredibly stupid. In the main, I suspect I am optimistic because I choose to be. I want to believe that over the long game, smart might win out over stupid., An example of this could be seen in Australia where the markets have succeeded despite, not because of, our federal policy. We have witnessed a surge of solar and wind energy installation as a result. , Of course, that leads on to question global politics and economic systems. And, specifically, the broader question of how the capitalist system is able to reduce consumption and increase equity – which is not so easily addressed., Updated\nat 11.24pm EST\n, \n\n11.03pm EST\n23:03\n\n, Our second-last question for today, and it is a big one. , From Oskar Johnson via email:, Have we quantified the number of people exposed to smoke inhalation as a result of the fires 2019-20? What long-term health effects might there be of this inhalation?, Donna Green: , There are a number of research projects combining census data, hospital admissions, health centre presentations and related data ongoing as we speak. Given the timing and nature of this kind of research, it is very early days to see any research analysis or findings from this ‘summer of hell’ season just passed. , Frustratingly the research timeline for academic researchers does not generally allow for quick responses. Giving a quick example, generally you have to wait for an annual timeline to submit a proposal and then wait about a year to find out whether your proposal (with a success rate of about 10%) has been funded. If it is funded, usually the research budget will get cut about 10-30%. This means research analysis response times can be frustratingly slow., There have been some ‘targeted research calls’ that have a very tight turnaround. Last month the federal government announced $5m for research projects to respond to the bushfire crisis. This is a good start, however coming off the back of years of cuts to scientific research budgets there is a lot of ground to make up., We just don’t really know the long-term effects of the exposure that many Australians felt over the last summer. Populations respond differently, for example. We can’t easily extrapolate from studies in, for example, heavily polluted cities in China or India, because Australians in the main are not exposed to high levels of air pollution routinely. That means that our bodies are not used to the pollution and consequently often the health impacts can be more serious., Updated\nat 11.07pm EST\n, \n\n10.53pm EST\n22:53\n\n, Via email from Rose:, How can we protect against exacerbating further health inequities ie only rich people and wealthy workplaces (and well-funded childcare centres) being able to afford high quality air purifiers?, Donna Green:, I wish I had a good answer for this. Just as we are currently seeing an increase in private jets being flown into Asia in response to Covid-19, there will always be inequality in the system. , Reducing the inequality can be carried out through policy, and policies can get encouraged via grassroots pressure, especially at the local level. I would imagine local politicians might respond favourably to requests from a small percentage of their voters demanding reasonable provisions in public buildings including childcare centres, for example. They could perhaps encourage state- or territory-level policy to be reconsidered in this respect. It is tricky though as each building is different in terms of build, age, windows, usage, existing air conditioning etc., As important (if not more) will be real energy policy change to ensure that the kids currently in childcare centres have the best possible chance to grow up in a less climate-changed world. Given that environmental injustice already exists in Australia for air pollution and human health, attacking both the climate/energy policy angle now (as Michael Mann so eloquently discussed just before) is crucial to address future air pollution inequality., Updated\nat 11.03pm EST\n, \n\n10.44pm EST\n22:44\n\n, A question via comment: , Could you tell us the latest yet-to-be-published data on the effects of climate change and air pollution on mental health?, Donna Green: , I’m not privy to unpublished data, but there are good, recently published systematic reviews on this topic. For example, if you search online for ‘Air Pollution (Particulate Matter) Exposure and Associations with Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, Psychosis and Suicide Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis’. The associations between PM2.5 and ultra fines with mental health are identified in this review., It would be likely that at the end of this year you would also start to see some more research published in this area for Australia specifically given that there was a targeted funding call of $2m to support analysis of the effect of bushfire smoke and mental health last month., Other potentially useful places to look for this research include: Understanding how climate change and floods affect mental health and community wellbeing via Sydney University, or some of the work of Prof Helen Berry., Updated\nat 11.04pm EST\n, \n\n10.39pm EST\n22:39\n\n, From Kirsty Harris:, What can citizens do in their streets and suburbs to reduce the impact of heat on their health? If part of the answer is to plant trees, what kind should we be planting, and where do we get lists of trees that will be more suitable for surviving a hotter, drier climate? , Donna Green:, Local councils are a good place to start asking about which trees are good for planting in your neighbourhood. Many have lists they can give you and they would be taking into consideration your local area and the ecosystem that the tree will (hopefully) grow up in. , Soft landscaping which has permeable surfaces and the use of native small grasses and shrubs instead of lawns is better during droughts due to the lower water needs, and the support of local birds and other critters. As we’ve also seen in many places recently, lots of hard surfaces increase run-off, especially during extreme rainfall, which increases flooding. To reduce these problems, now and for the near future, if you have a choice about upgrading gardens, these sorts of things could be kept in mind., Updated\nat 10.43pm EST\n, \n\n10.35pm EST\n22:35\n\n, A question from Nicola Harvey:, I’m a farmer who strongly believes in climate change and I really struggle in arguments with reactionaries (other farmers). What are the most important points to use in an argument about climate change, to really substantiate my argument on the reality of climate change as I end up very frustrated. Thank you.,  Donna Green:, You are not alone! Fortunately there are a range of good websites that can provide answers to some of the more frustrating climate denier arguments. See John Cook’s site or Real Climate. It’s also important to realise that there are lots of similar farmers who share your frustrations and who can tailor responses appropriately. Anika Molesworth, if you don’t already know her, provides excellent commentary. , Updated\nat 10.43pm EST\n, \n\n10.26pm EST\n22:26\n\n, Via email from Tim:, What effect will all the bushfire smoke have on a foetus? I’ve heard that there is some disturbing evidence on this from fires in the US., Donna Green:, Researchers have found that some of the smallest pollution particles (PM2.5 and ultrafines) can cross into the bloodstream (unlike larger PM10 particles that can get trapped in your nose hairs or mucus). These smaller particles, among others, are found in bushfire smoke. Because your blood circulates everywhere throughout all your body’s systems, and in this case potentially crossing the placenta, there is concern that there would be impacts on foetuses. , Moreover, if the mother’s health is compromised by inhaling bushfire smoke, that could of course indirectly affect the health and wellbeing of the baby. Research examining the associations between exposure to pollution and stillbirths, miscarriages and pre-term delivery has been ongoing worldwide. Australian researchers are currently looking for these relationships over the past summer period to see if they can see similar relationships. , Updated\nat 10.34pm EST\n, \n\n10.21pm EST\n22:21\n\n, From Josh via email:, Did the NSW and ACT health departments respond appropriately to minimise the effects of exposure to bushfire smoke during the summer? Or should they have issued a directive that, for example, childcare centres keep children inside during the worst days? ,  Prof Donna Green: , We do know that there is ‘no safe level’ of air pollution, and that children are more susceptible than adults to air pollution, so your concerns are well founded. , Many of Australia’s buildings are quite ‘leaky’ so staying inside can be better than outside – but not necessarily the best place to be on the very worst pollution days. This is especially true for vulnerable populations (children, for instance). In these cases, the childcare centres and schools may not have been the best places for the kids, even if they were kept inside., It would be great if, as was recently called for, an independent national expert committee on air pollution and health was set up to develop evidence-based, accurate, practical and consistent advice on health protection against bushfire smoke. The Medical Journal of Australia has a very timely article on the need for this to happen, and quickly.

However, in Africa only 230,000 early deaths a year, and just over eight months of the 3.1 years of life expectancy lost, would be saved. In Australiathe gains would be even smaller. , That, the authors note, is down to a variety of factors, including Africa’s outdoor air pollution being dominated by wind-blown dust and Australia having stricter air pollution policies than many other countries to start with., The team found the number of premature deaths owing to air pollution generally increased with age.However, for some regions, including Africa and south Asia, there is also a high number of premature deaths among very young children., Coronary heart disease accounted for the largest number of extra deaths for any of the six categories, at almost 2.8m a year worldwide, and made up more than 28% of the loss in life expectancy. By contrast deaths from lung cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease and lower respiratory infections together made up about 2.6m early deaths from outdoor air pollution a year., Prof Thomas Münzel, of the University Medical Centre Mainz in Germany and co-author of the study, said this was not surprising. “Even though the lung is the primary target of air pollution, causing inflammation and therefore pneumonia, there will be a transmigration of particles into the bloodstream and into blood vessels,” he said, noting that will cause inflammation and, over time, plaque will build up in the arteries., Münzel said the findings underscore the importance of including air pollution as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in official guidelines for such conditions., However, the study has a number of limitations, including that it only looks at two air pollutants. and does not look at the chemical makeup of the particulate matter. Among other factors, the team note there may be diseases that should be associated with air pollution that are not currently, while the models are based on data from a limited number of countries. , As a result, the team say there are large uncertainties in the findings. Nonetheless, Münzel said, the study emphasises the need for governments to take action., “We need lower emission levels – 91% of the world’s population breathes polluted air as defined by the World Health Organization,” he said. “We have incredibly high limits for Europe: those need to be reduced markedly.”, The team note measures can include city planning and management, while improvements in healthcare can also improve life expectancy. Münzel added it was also important to conduct research into drugs that could mitigate the health impacts of air pollution., Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said the uncertainty in the figures means that is it not yet clear whether air pollution is a bigger killer than tobacco, but that it certainly rivals it. That, he said, is because although smoking a packet of cigarettes a day is more dangerous, a higher proportion of people inhale air pollution than tobacco smoke., The work is published in the journal Cardiovascular Research.outdoor air pollution cuts three years from human lifespan study", "label": 0}, "train-435": {"text": "\nTropical forests losing their ability to absorb carbon, study finds\n, Amazon could turn into source of CO2 in atmosphere by next decade, research suggests , \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nWed 4 Mar 2020 12.08 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Wed 4 Mar 2020 11.00 EST\n\n, Tropical forests are taking up less carbon dioxide from the air, reducing their ability to act as “carbon sinks” and bringing closer the prospect of accelerating climate breakdown., The Amazon could turn into a source of carbon in the atmosphere, instead of one of the biggest absorbers of the gas, as soon as the next decade, owing to the damage caused by loggers and farming interests and the impacts of the climate crisis, new research has found., If that happens, climate breakdown is likely to become much more severe in its impacts, and the world will have to cut down much faster on carbon-producing activities to counteract the loss of the carbon sinks., “We’ve found that one of the most worrying impacts of climate change has already begun,” said Simon Lewis, professor in the school of geography at Leeds University, one of the senior authors of the research. “This is decades ahead of even the most pessimistic climate models.”, For the last three decades, the amount of carbon absorbed by the world’s intact tropical forests has fallen, according to the study from nearly 100 scientific institutions. They are now taking up a third less carbon than they did in the 1990s, owing to the impacts of higher temperatures, droughts and deforestation. That downward trend is likely to continue, as forests come under increasing threat from climate change and exploitation. The typical tropical forest may become a carbon source by the 2060s, according to Lewis., “Humans have been lucky so far, as tropical forests are mopping up lots of our pollution, but they can’t keep doing that indefinitely,” he told the Guardian. “We need to curb fossil fuel emissions before the global carbon cycle starts working against us. The time for action is now.”, At this year’s UN climate talks, known as Cop26 and to be held in Glasgow in November, many countries are expected to come forward with plans to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. But some rich countries and many companies plan to reduce their emissions via offsetting, often by preserving, replanting or growing new forest., This research shows that relying on tropical forests is unlikely to be enough to offset large-scale emissions. “There is a lot of talk about offsetting, but the reality is that every country and every sector needs to reach zero emissions, with any small amount of residual emissions needing to be removed from the atmosphere,” said Lewis. “The use of forests as an offset is largely a marketing tool for companies to try to continue with business as usual.”, The uptake of carbon from the atmosphere by tropical forests peaked in the 1990s when about 46bn tonnes were removed from the air, equivalent to about 17% of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities. By the last decade, that amount had sunk to about 25bn tonnes, or just 6% of global emissions., The difference is about the same as a decade of fossil fuel emissions from the UK, Germany, France and Canada put together., Climate scientists have long feared the existence of “tipping points” in the climate system, which when passed will condemn the world to runaway global heating. There are many known feedback mechanisms: for instance, the melting of Arctic ice leaves more of the sea uncovered, and, as it is darker than the reflective ice, it absorbs more heat, thus leading to more melting., These feedback mechanisms have the potential to accelerate the climate crisis far ahead of what current projections suggest. If forests start to become sources of carbon rather than absorbers of it, that would be a powerful positive feedback leading to much greater warming that would be hard to stop., Forests lose their ability to absorb carbon as trees die and dry out from drought and higher temperatures, but the loss of forest area from logging, burning and other forms of exploitation is also a leading factor in the loss of carbon sinks., Tom Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab, who was not involved with the research, told the Guardian: “This analysis provides concerning evidence that, along with continuing deforestation rates, the carbon sequestration rate of tropical forests could also be threatened by increasing tree mortality under climate change. This is very important information, as the capacity of tropical forests to capture anthropogenic carbon emissions could be severely impaired.”, The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, tracked 300,000 trees over 30 years, providing the first large-scale evidence of the decline in carbon uptake by the world’s tropical forests. The researchers combined data from two large research networks of forest observations in Africa and the Amazon, as well as years spent travelling to remote field sites, including a week spent in a dug-out canoe to reach Salonga national park in the troubled Democratic Republic of the Congo., They used aluminium nails to tag individual trees, measuring the diameter and estimating the height of every tree within 565 patches of forest, and returning every few years to repeat the process. This enabled them to calculate the carbon stored in the trees that survived and those that died. They found that the Amazon sink started weakening first, but that African forests are now rapidly following. Amazonian forests are exposed to higher temperatures, faster temperature increases, and more frequent and severe droughts, than African forests., Their projection that the Amazonian forest will turn into a carbon source in the mid-2030s is based on their observations and a statistical model and trends in emissions, temperature and rainfall to forecast changes in how forests will store carbon up to 2040., Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said governments should heed the science and make strong commitments to cut greenhouse gases at the Cop26 summit, and agree to measures to protect and restore forests. “For years, we have had scientific warnings about tipping points in the Earth system and they’ve been largely ignored by policy and decision-makers,” he said. “That forests are now seemingly losing the ability to absorb pollution is alarming.

That’s absolutely a priority,” he said. The climate law was “so important”, because “it allows you to focus on other things without losing track of what you need to do to reach climate neutrality”., “Even if the Eye of Sauron is on something else for a bit, the trajectory to 2050 will be clear,” he said, in a reference to the dark forces in the Lord of the Rings. “Because we discipline ourselves with the climate law.”, Speaking to the Guardian and six other European newspapers shortly before the law was published, Timmermans said the proposal was revolutionary because all EU legislation would have to be in line with net zero emissions by the mid-century., Even before the text was officially released, the climate activist Greta Thunberg and teenage school strike leaders across Europe gave a blistering verdict, accusing the commission of ignoring climate science., Thunberg, who is meeting Von der Leyen, Timmermans and the rest of the commission’s top team, described the law as “surrender”. In an open letter, she said it failed to respect the goal of capping global heating at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – an aspiration the EU signed up to in the 2015 Paris agreement., She repeated that message at a meeting with MEPs on the European parliament’s environment committee on Wednesday. “In November 2019 the European parliament declared a climate and environment emergency,” she said. “You stated that yes, the house is actually burning, this was no false alarm, but then you went back inside, finished your dinner and watched your movie and went to bed without even calling the fire department., “When your house is on fire you don’t wait a few more years to start putting it out, and yet this is what the commission are proposing today.”, Earlier at a private meeting with EU commissioners the teenage activist was told by Timmermans that the movement she started was the reason the European Green Deal and climate law exists., European Union leaders in 2019 agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning more emissions will be removed than expelled into the atmosphere., The climate law proposed by the European commission makes that 2050 promise legally-binding. If an EU member state fails to make progress, the commission can take it to the European court of justice, which has the power to impose hefty daily fines for non-compliance., The commission, the body that drafts and enforces EU law, describes the draft regulation as revolutionary, because all EU legislation – whether farming, energy or transport – will have to be consistent with the 2050 climate target., Climate campaigners, notably Greta Thunberg who described the law as “surrender”, argue that it does not go far enough to reduce emissions in the next decade – a critical window if the world is to avoid climate breakdown that will come from overshooting the aspiration agreed at the 2015 Paris climate talks to keep warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The climate law does not include an emissions-reduction target for 2030, although the commission will table a proposal in September., EU governments are likely to object to the powers the commission wants to give itself to propose climate targets for 2035, 2040 and 2045. Under the powerful legal tool of “delegated acts”, the EU executive would be able to set targets with limited input from ministers and MEPs. That could prove tricky with governments and the European parliament, who must approve the climate law before it comes into force., , The climate scientist Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said the EU was aiming too low and its current targets on reducing emissions set in 2014 were not in line with the 1.5C goal., An IPCC report in 2018 showed that going beyond 1.5C, even by half a degree, would significantly increase the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for millions of people., Van Ypersele said the EU should be aiming for carbon neutrality one decade earlier. “If a region as technologically rich, as scientifically rich as the EU is only able to achieve that by 2050 how can you imagine that the rest of the world will do that by the same year? I don’t think it’s very likely.”, A dozen EU member states have also voiced reservations about Timmermans’ timetable for proposing an EU climate target for 2030, widely seen as a crucial goal if the world is not to exceed its carbon budget., Timmermans plans to set out the EU’s 2030 goal in September, but the dozen countries argue this is too late to galvanise the rest of the world to make commitments at crucial UN climate talks in Glasgow at the end of the year., The vice-president rejected these arguments, saying his officials needed the summer to do a thorough impact assessment of the 2030 goal. “If the commission were to come out with a not duly assessed number we would have months and months of discussion about a percentage and then the EU would not have a position either.”, He said the EU’s 2030 target would be in time for the EU to have a position at the Cop26 talks in Glasgow., Timmermans also voiced confidence in the British government’s preparations for Cop26. Campaigners have been concerned about a shaky start, with the new Cop26 president – the business secretary, Alok Sharma – only appointed three weeks ago, after his predecessor was abruptly sacked. The UK has yet to set out a strategy or timetable for the cconference, widely seen as critical to getting the world back on track with the 2015 Paris goals., This is Europe is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. , “The UK has formidable capacities in this area,” he said, adding that Brexit had not created a rift between the EU and UK over climate goals. “Brexit weakens the EU, full stop. And, in my view, weakens the UK, full stop,” he said. “I don’t see any object of discord, or disagreement or confrontation between EU and United Kingdom on this issue, of making a success of Glasgow.”, But he is likely to face a tougher response from governments in central and eastern Europe that are wary of rapid action on the climate emergency, especially Poland, which generates 80% of its electricity from coal., The climate law means governments failing to meet targets could be taken to the European court of justice and fined., Timmermans said “the hardest, hardest thing we will have to do” is guaranteeing that the European Green Deal will benefit the whole of society., He said he was angered by claims that tackling climate change was against the poor, while acknowledging that a failure to benefit everyone carried risks. “If we are not able to show that it is done in a fair way more and more people will say no, we will give food to extremist parties, who will try to demonstrate that this is only a plan for Tesla-driving tofu eaters., “But the real victims of the climate crisis will be the poorest people in society.

Many have decided not to return, despite government reassurances on safety, and many of those who have returned are older residents., Futaba is no exception, with just 10% of residents saying they intend to return. Some, particularly those with young children, are concerned about radiation levels, while others have built new lives elsewhere., Yuji Onuma, a Futaba resident, said recent work to repair streets and decontaminate the town centre was designed to give the world a false impression before the Olympic torch relay., “I wish they wouldn’t hold the relay here,” Onuma told Reuters. Pointing at workers repaving a road expected to be on the relay route, he added: “Their number one aim is to show people how much we’ve recovered. I don’t think people will understand anything by just seeing cleaned-up tracts of land.”, Radiation readings in the air taken in February near Futaba’s railway station were around 0.28 microsieverts per hour, higher than the government-set target of 0.23 microsieverts an hour., Another part of the town had a reading of 4.64 microsieverts per hour on the same day, meaning a person would reach the annual exposure upper limit of 1 millisievert, recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, in just nine days., The torch is due to pass through the village of Iitate the following day, but campaigners this week described the relay as inappropriate and warned they had found radiation “hotspots” in the village., In a survey of 69 locations along and around the proposed relay route, the grassroots group the Radioactivity Monitoring Centre for Citizens said it had found 44 sites with radioactive levels above 0.23 microsieverts per hour, including one “severe hotspot” of 0.85 microsieverts per hour along the torch relay route., The discovery of hotspots near J-Village by Greenpeace Japan at the end of last year prompted the environment ministry and the nuclear plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, to perform extra decontamination work., While some independent monitors have said the discovery of isolated hotspots does not present an accurate picture of the overall situation in Fukushima, Nobuyoshi Ito, an Iitate farmer, said the civic group’s findings cast doubts on government claims that decontamination work had been a success., “Radiation exposure for runners passing along the route may not be very high, but the overall situation in places like Iitate is severe,” Ito said. “Levels are several times to as many as 20 times higher in the village than they were before the disaster, and people who moved back have to put up with that 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.”, Of Iitate’s pre-disaster population of 6,100, only 1,200 people have returned, Ito said. “The small number of people coming means that the nuclear disaster is not over yet. The truth is that full recovery from a nuclear disaster like this is just not possible.”, Agencies contributed to this reportjapan lifts evacuation order futaba town fukushima disaster", "label": 0}, "train-438": {"text": "\nCountry diary: gulls overhead as they make for the coast\n, Langstone, Hampshire: Many are heading due south to West Hayling local nature reserve, \nClaire Stares, \n\nWed 4 Mar 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, During the winter months, sunset is heralded by a steady stream of gulls flying over my house. Having spent the day feeding inland, puddling for worms on playing fields and farmland, picking over the waste at landfill sites or scavenging for discarded food in urban streets and car parks, they commute coastward to Langstone Harbour., Gulls often travel long distances between their feeding and roosting grounds, and they tend to favour specific sites. Many are heading due south to West Hayling local nature reserve, where they will raft on the saline lagoon or congregate on the remains of the rocky bund walls that once separated the oyster bed pens. Others will veer west towards Farlington Marshes, where they can spend the night in relative safety, or one of the five low-lying harbour islands., Black-headed gulls are the first to appear, the majority still displaying their smudgy-headed winter plumage, though the number of chocolate-brown-hooded birds is increasing day by day. The earliest arrivals often alight on my neighbour’s roof. Screeching and scrapping, they swoop down to snatch up the table scraps and stale cat food that she leaves out on her patio. As the light fades they grow noticeably restless, repeatedly flying up en masse, circling above the garden and resettling on the ridge tiles, before finally taking off to resume their journey., While black-headed gulls are by far the most numerous species participating in this daily commute, they are joined by small groups of herring gulls, who announce their presence with plaintive cries. I’m yet to hear the exclamatory mewling call of a Mediterranean gull this year, but I have spotted one or two slipping silently overhead, their unmarked underwing coverts and pure white wingtips distinguishing them from the similarly sized black-headed gulls, whose primary feathers are tipped with black., A few gulls travel solo, but most move in a loose V formation, appearing to follow the same narrow flight lines.

TB in cattle is a severe problem for farmers and taxpayers, leading to the compulsory slaughter of 30,000 cattle and a cost of £150m every year., An independent review in 2018 of the government’s policies for eradicating bovine TB (bTB) by 2038 found that frequent trading of cattle and poor biosecurity on farms was severely hampering efforts to tackle the crisis. The scientists said it was highly desirable to move from culling to vaccination of badgers., Ministers responded to the review on Thursday, saying: “The government envisages that the current intensive culling policy would begin to be phased out in the next few years, gradually replaced by government-supported badger vaccination and surveillance.”, The government said it would be “incentivising the uptake of effective biosecurity measures and managing the bTB risks posed by cattle movements to reduce the risk of spread within and between farms”., Scientists have long argued that tightening rules on cattle movement are central to tackling bTB, particularly as the diagnostic test can fail to identify infections., Ministers said they would back work on a better test and accelerate research to develop a deployable cattle bTB vaccine within the next five years. Past cattle vaccines have not allowed vets to differentiate between infected animals and those than have been inoculated, but new research at the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency may have overcome this obstacle., “Overall, this is a seismic shift in an area of government policy which has been highly controversial for many years,” said Prof Rosie Woodroffe at the Zoological Society of London. “The response rightly highlights cattle-based measures. This focus is appropriate, because the best estimates show that most cattle herds that acquire TB are infected by other cattle herds.”, Woodroffe said bTB had to be controlled in badgers if the disease was to be completely eradicated. But she said: “Vaccination is the most promising option because, unlike culling, it has the potential to eradicate TB from badgers, as well as being cheaper, more humane, and more environmentally friendly.” She said a phased transition from culling to vaccination was sensible as it would take time to train vaccinators., Dominic Dyer, the head of the Badger Trust, said the government’s new approach was groundbreaking: “The government has concluded that the mass indiscriminate slaughter of badgers, an iconic British wildlife species, will not provide a long-term solution to reducing bovine TB in cattle., “Today the government has finally come up with a long-term exit strategy from badger culling based on cattle-based control measures and TB vaccination in both badgers and cattle. This is better for taxpayers, farmers and the future of our precious wildlife.” , The government said: “Culling would remain an option where epidemiological assessment indicates it is needed.” It also said a scientific study of the first four years of culling showed significant reductions in bTB infection in cattle., However, the authors of the study noted that changes to how the cull was conducted over time “in response to political climate” made the analysis challenging., Woodroffe said the data analysed had come from the first two cull areas, but one of those areas recorded a spike in bTB the year after the analysis ended. Furthermore, she said, a third area showed evidence of increased cattle TB. There are now 43 cull areas across England.badger cull phased out replaced vaccinations bovine tb england", "label": 0}, "train-440": {"text": "\nThis winter in Europe was hottest on record by far, say scientists\n, Climate crisis likely to have supercharged temperatures around world, data suggests, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 07.24 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 12.00 EST\n\n, This winter has been by far the hottest recorded in Europe, scientists have announced, with the climate crisis likely to have supercharged the heat., The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) data dates back to 1855.

Europe’s winter was 3.4C hotter than the average from 1981-2010., The unseasonal heat has led to the failure of the ice-wine harvest in Germany and snow having to be imported for sporting events in Sweden and Russia. In Helsinki, Finland, the average temperature for January and February was more than 6C higher than the 1981-2010 average. In the UK, serious flooding is likely to have been made worse by higher temperatures, as in 2015., “Whilst this winter was a truly extreme event in its own right, it is likely that these sorts of events have been made more extreme by the global warming trend,” said Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S., But he added: “Seeing such a warm winter is disconcerting, but does not represent a climate trend as such. Seasonal temperatures, especially outside the tropics vary significantly from year to year.”, Nonetheless, scientists expect global heating to increase the number of temperature extremes and this is continuing around the world. Australia, which has suffered catastrophic bushfires, has just recorded its second-hottest summer on record, only a little cooler than the record set the year before., In Antarctica, the temperature rose above 20C for the first time on record in February, almost a full degree higher than the previous record set in 1982., Across the globe as a whole, 2019 was the second hottest on record for the planet’s surface and both the past five years and the past decade were the hottest in 150 years. The previous hottest year was in 2016, but temperatures were boosted that year by a natural El Niño event. The heat in the world’s oceans reached a new record level in 2019, showing “irrefutable and accelerating” heating of the planet, according to scientists., In the UK, the Met Office said in January that a series of high temperature records were broken in 2019 as a consequence of the climate crisis. This included the hottest temperature ever recorded in the country: 38.7C on 25 July in Cambridge., 2020 is a crucial year in the fight to halt the climate emergency and prevent the damaging impacts worsening. The UK is hosting a vital UN climate summit in November at which the world’s nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions to avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures.truly extreme winter 2019 20 in europe by far hottest on record", "label": 0}, "train-441": {"text": "\nGlowing, glowing, gone: plunge in glow-worm numbers revealed\n, Exclusive: study shows a 75% fall in 18 years in England, with climate a clear factor, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 04.20 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 6 Mar 2020 06.18 EST\n\n, Glow-worm numbers have plunged by three-quarters since 2001, research in England has revealed, with the climate crisis a clear factor., The larvae feed on damp-loving snails, and increasingly hot and dry summers mean fewer prey and a greater risk of glow-worms becoming desiccated., Some of the 19 sites studied across Essex are on nature reserves. The data there showed that clearing scrub and coppicing woods to open up ground helped offset glow-worm losses, indicating that conservation action is possible., Glow-worms are small beetles and they exist in small patches across the UK. The females glow green to attract mates. They are wingless, making it hard for them to rebuild lost populations., “Glow-worms were thought to be declining, and probably for several decades now, but there was no hard evidence,” said Tim Gardiner, of the Environment Agency, who led the research. “We have shown a big decline, and at many different sites around Essex. The changing climate has undoubtedly played a role.”, This is the first study to provide hard data on long-term changes in the glow-worm populationThe research, published in the journal Insect Conservation and Diversity, used data collected by citizen scientists during nighttime walks in June, July and August each year. “A lot of people are just recording one or two glow-worms when they go out,” Gardiner said., The scientists accounted for changes in weather and the earlier emergence of the glow-worms as the climate heats up to calculate the trend over time. “If they decline like they have declined for the last 18 years, then in another 18 years there are going to be a lot more local extinctions,” said Gardiner., Scientists warned in February that “fates of humans and insects are intertwined”, with the huge declines reported in some places only the “tip of the iceberg”. They acknowledge that little is known about most of the estimated 5.5 million insect species but said enough was understood to warrant immediate action., Widespread insect declines threaten a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, with dire consequences for humanity, some scientists have said., Gardiner emphasised the intrinsic wonder of glow-worms. “I still remember when I saw my first one. It was just magical, and every summer I still get a pang of excitement on seeing the first one. Wouldn’t it be sad if there weren’t these things any more?”, The glow-worm research was one of a dozen studies published in a special issue of Insect Conservation and Diversity. Many report declines in some – but not all – insects., In the US, scientists compiled sightings of the endangered Poweshiek skipperling butterfly from 1872 to now, showing that its geographic range has shrunk dramatically over time. Evidence from 217 sites shows the butterfly was historically common across the prairies of the upper mid-western US. But populations declined rapidly in the past 20 years as habitat was destroyed, and the butterfly is now extinct at all but five locations., A 20-year study of a threatened flightless longhorn beetle at 13 sites in Switzerland, France and Germany recorded a fall in abundance of 90%, with the intensification of farming the main likely cause., Researchers in the UK using light and suction traps recorded a 30% fall in moth abundance between 1969 and 2016, but found aphid populations remained level. In the Netherlands, light and pitfall traps found declines in abundance of 40-60% among moths, beetles and caddisflies between 1997 and 2017 , but true bugs, mayflies and lacewings did not show similar changes., Prof Raphael Didham, of the University of Western Australia, who edited the special issue of the journal, said: “The problem is clearly global in extent, but the solutions needed are going to be many-fold and range from local individual choices to regional policies that reduce the intensity of human impacts on the environment, and global commitments to maintaining insect biodiversity.”, But he said the available data did not in itself constitute evidence for a sudden and catastrophic collapse of all insect populations. “In fact, we need to be equally worried about some examples of insect population increases as well, such as new incursions of invasive species, or cyclical pest outbreaks, and geographic range expansions due to climate change that could disrupt sensitive natural ecosystems,” Didham said., On the plight of glow-worms in England, Gardiner said: “People should visit their local sites and become a champion for glow-worms. They’re not legally protected and by the time they become legally protected, it may be too late.”glowing glowing gone plunge in glow worm numbers revealed", "label": 0}, "train-442": {"text": "\n'Individual actions do add up': Christiana Figueres on the climate crisis\n, Trump’s words made the architect of the Paris accord livid – but she’s become an advocate for positivity about climate action, \nEmily Holden, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 03.00 EST\n\n, Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who was an architect of the worldwide Paris climate agreement, is enraged. She thinks you should be too., She was traveling in 2017 when Donald Trump made plans to announce the US withdrawal from the pact. Perched at the end of her hotel bed with pen and paper, she decided to write down each correct statement she heard., “The speech finished and my piece of paper was completely blank,” Figueres told the Guardian in an interview. “There was not a sentence uttered in that whole speech that was correct, true or even informed.”, With tiny silver frogs dangling from her ears and strung around her neck, the small-framed Figueres is animated as she recalls the story, alternately pushing back in her chair and lowering her head toward her crossed arms., Trump gave his remarks in the White House Rose Garden, a venue typically reserved for major events., “My first thought was the poor roses, they had to listen to all this,” Figueres said., Figueres, who was executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, could easily be swallowed up by her anger at the intensifying climate crisis. But instead she has become an advocate for positivity about climate action., Despite Trump’s planned withdrawal, not a single nation has followed suit. Countries that agreed to the Paris deal, however, are not on track to fulfill their obligations. And, even if they were, their actions wouldn’t be enough to stall significant global warming., Figueres and her former senior advisor Tom Rivett-Carnac, who was once a Buddhist monk, have written a book they pitch as “surprisingly optimistic”. It’s titled The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis, and it offers two contrasting visions for how the world might look in 30 years. They also have a podcast, called Outrage and Optimism., Rivett-Carnac said people can be upset and positive at the same time., “We see this form of stubborn optimism as a way of changing the world,” he said. It’s not like we wake up every morning thinking, ‘everything’s ok, don’t worry.’”, Figueres argues that society is “paralyzed and obsessed about the consequences of climate change,” and hasn’t been able to separate that fear from the upsides of cutting the fossil fuel and other emissions heating the planet., She lists the possible benefits: stronger economies, energy independence, a livable environment, breathable air, less time wasted commuting, improved health, an increased connection to nature, and “on and on,” she says., Trump believes the Paris deal would sink the US economy. In Figueres’ mind, if there was any country aware of the growth opportunities from addressing the climate crisis, it was the US., “There was hardly any country that had actually gone into such an analysis of the text,” she said. “Frankly, there was barely a country that contributed as much to the text … It’s very sad when you basically cut your nose off to spite your face.”, She said “the sad thing is that the US has become irrelevant in the most consequential challenge that humanity has faced,” clarifying that she meant the federal government, and not the states, localities and businesses that have stepped up to make their own pledges in its place., The book and podcast come as eco-anxiety is growing, particularly among younger people., Nearly half of US adults under the age of 35 say stress about climate change affects their lives, according to a poll by the American Psychological Association. Among all adults, seven in 10 say they wish they could do more to combat climate change, but 51% say they don’t know where to start., Figueres wants those people to take their power back., “We would say what makes you feel better quickly is actually to engage in a positive contribution so that you bust through this myth that individual actions don’t count And you begin to realize the world is only made out of individual actions,” she said. “It does count. It does add up.”christiana figueres climate crisis", "label": 0}, "train-443": {"text": "\nAnalysis shows climate finance not reaching most vulnerable\n, Funding is intended to help countries protect their people from the climate breakdown, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nWed 4 Mar 2020 19.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 08.03 EST\n\n, People in some of the world’s poorest countries are receiving as little as $1 each a year to help them cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, despite rich countries’ promises to provide assistance., Climate finance is intended to help developing countries cut greenhouse gases and protect their people from the consequences of climate breakdown, and forms a core part of the Paris agreement. Rich countries pledged more than 10 years ago to provide $100bn (£77m) a year to the poor by 2020, but it is not certain that these commitments are being met., Last week the UK unveiled its strategy for providing climate finance as part of its presidency of Cop26, this year’s vital UN climate summit being held in November in Glasgow. However, no new funding was announced and no data has yet been produced showing whether the pledges of $100bn are likely to be met this year., A new analysis of climate finance by the charity WaterAid suggested that existing climate finance is not reaching the poorest and most vulnerable, who are likely to be worst affected by the climate crisis. The charity’s report found that half of all countries receive less than $5 per person per year in climate finance., Yemen received about $1.17 for each of its people per year on average between 2010 and 2017, WaterAid’s analysis found, despite the country being ranked at 29th in the world’s most vulnerable to the impacts of climate breakdown., The figure for Sudan was $1.33, despite it being the seventh most vulnerable country in the world. Angola, another of the 50 most vulnerable, received $1.58 per person per year over the period, and the Central African Republic – 16th in the most vulnerable ranking – received $1.61 per person per year., “Billions of people around the world are already living with the impact of the climate crisis, whether through flooding in the UK, bushfires in the US and Australia, or sea level rises in coastal areas,” said Tim Wainwright, chief executive of WaterAid. “But most of the suffering brought about by climate change does not make the headlines. It is poor and vulnerable communities, who have done virtually nothing to create this situation, finding it harder and harder each year to find enough clean water to live.”, Although water is at the heart of the climate crisis – because some of the biggest impacts will be felt in the form of droughts and floods – spending on water issues takes a low priority in climate finance. WaterAid found that only a fraction of the money spent on climate finance goes on efforts to improve access to water or sanitation., Chad receives only $0.19 per person per year for water and sanitation and Ethiopia $0.39 per person., Access to clean water will become an even more pressing problem in much of the developing world as the climate crisis takes hold. About 800 million people live without proper access to water near to home, and 2 billion people live without a water service that is reliable, safe and free from contamination. , “No one can survive without clean water and no one can thrive if they have to struggle to find it,” said Wainwright. “We can expect more extreme weather events, more uncertainty and more people forced to live without safe water.”, The report found about $30bn a year was disbursed by rich governments to the developing world to fund measures to adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown. Funding for measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions – for instance through renewable energy – is more likely to attract private sector funding., The poorest and most vulnerable countries also have some of the lowest levels of greenhouse gas levels in the world., A Cop26 spokesperson said: “The UK’s record on international climate finance is one of the best in the world and has helped us to reach some of the poorest and most vulnerable people. To date, the UK has supported 57 million people to cope with the effects of climate change and provided 26 million improved access to clean energy where it is needed most. Last year, the prime minister announced our international climate finance contribution would double to £11.6bn between 2021 and 2025. The UK is the first major economy to make this commitment, and we are calling on other donors to follow our leadership.”analysis shows climate finance not reaching most vulnerable", "label": 0}, "train-444": {"text": "\nClimate activists demand budget plan for low-carbon future\n, Campaigners press chancellor for clear signal UK government is taking Cop26 seriously, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 12.20 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 6 Mar 2020 13.08 EST\n\n, Climate campaigners are urging the government to set out a clear plan for a low-carbon future in next week’s budget, despite the chancellor’s decision to pull a major plank of climate policy at the last minute., The budget will determine much of the government’s work this year, and campaigners fear that a failure to send clear signals on meeting the 2050 net zero emissions target would play badly with other countries looking to the UK for leadership as host of the vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, later this year., Hopes were dealt a blow when it emerged on Friday that a major policy announcement on national infrastructure – including an overhaul of Britain’s energy, transport and water infrastructure to cut greenhouse gas emissions and help cope with the impacts of extreme weather – would be postponed., “This budget is a big opportunity for the government to set out their stall for Cop26 and lead by example, so it’s disappointing that we may not have a major announcement on low-carbon infrastructure as part of it,” said Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK., “But if ministers are using the additional time to improve the plan, that may not be a bad thing. The chancellor should set out a clear timeline for this infrastructure programme and support at least 5% of government spending on climate and nature in the budget. This would show that ministers mean business in tackling the climate emergency.”, Dave Timms, the head of politics at Friends of the Earth, said: “The government reconsidering support for expensive climate-wrecking infrastructure projects such as the £30bn road-building programme would be a welcome sign that international climate commitments are being taken more seriously. However, they need to urgently press ahead with funding a national programme of investment in the UK’s cold and leaky homes where there are clear benefits for the economy, households, and the planet.”, Next Wednesday’s budget will be the first since Britain left the EU and the first since the UK adopted the net zero carbon target, enshrined in law by Theresa May last summer in one of her final acts as prime minister. It will also be scrutinised carefully by other nations for signals that the government is taking Cop26 seriously, after a troubled start to the UK’s presidency., The EU is setting out its European Green Deal, a massive overarching strategy encompassing all aspects of the European economy, hoped to lead to net zero emissions by mid-century. The EU will use its green deal in a bid to draw China, the world’s biggest emitter, into a pact to cut greenhouse gases drastically., Without a similar strategy, the UK may lack credibility in trying to form the “grand coalition” of countries that experts say is necessary to make Cop26 – the conference of the parties, to be held in Glasgow this November – a success., “We’ve been promised a green budget, and with only eight months to go till the UN climate talks, it’s essential we get one,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of Green Alliance. “The government is badly off target to deliver its legally binding climate commitments. This is the moment to get on track.”, Campaigners want to see the government commit to a range of measures that would reduce carbon, beyond the piecemeal announcements made so far. Boris Johnson said last month at the launch of Cop26 that the moratorium on sales of new diesel and petroleum cars would be brought forward five years to 2035, and this week ministers agreed to make onshore wind farms eligible for public support, and to increase the content of biofuels in petrol., Green groups and experts say much more is needed, including strategies on fixing Britain’s heat-leaking homes, boosting renewables, halting the rapid rise in emissions from transport, restoring the natural environment and tackling waste., “As the first major opportunity for the Johnson government to show it is serious on delivering net zero, the budget is a huge moment ahead of Cop26,” said Jonathan Marshall, the head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “The minimum expected is to lead by example and convince other nations to submit ambitious pledges, amplifying domestic action on to the global stage. The UK can show the world that hitting net zero is eminently possible, and is more than just a slogan.”, Local government is also urging the chancellor to deliver a green budget for Cop26. A group of councils and local government organisations wrote to the chancellor on Friday to say that councils are “uniquely well placed to help the government meet its carbon emissions reduction targets”., Some groups are calling for the government to devote at least 5% of spending to the low carbon effort., “Massive investment in our abundant renewable power potential, public transport and a nationwide energy efficiency programme would put the UK at the forefront of the green industrial revolution – and show genuine leadership ahead of this year’s crucial climate summit in Glasgow,” said Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth., In a sign of the growing impact of the coronavirus on Cop26, the UN announced planned meetings in Bonn in March and April would be cancelled. However the main preparatory Cop26 meeting scheduled for Bonn in June is so far unaffected., Some also fear that the need for urgent measures on the coronavirus will distract attention from the green agenda., “The need to avoid recession as a result of coronavirus cannot be made an excuse for dodging vital decisions on de-carbonising the economy,” said Spiers. “Investing in warmer homes, infrastructure for electric vehicles, the renewable energy industry and natural flood defences will boost the economy, not least in poorer regions, as well as tackling the climate and wider environmental emergency.”climate activists demand budget plan for low carbon future", "label": 0}, "train-445": {"text": "\nThe week in wildlife – in pictures\n, The week in wildlife – in pictures, The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including swimming cheetahs and an albino orangutan, , \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 11.55 EST\n\n, Photograph: Sam Yeh/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Ali Ihsan Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images, Photograph: Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Andrew Sutton/Central Studio, Photograph: Natalie Behring/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Natalie Behring/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: EPA, Photograph: Buddhilini De Soyza/Mediadrumimages, Photograph: Seth Jackson/Cornwall Wildlife Trust, Photograph: Andre Botha/Vulture Conservation Foundation, Photograph: Katia Christodoulou/EPA, Photograph: Jorge Sáenz/AP, Photograph: Ye Aung Thu/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Issouf Sanogo/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Patrick Pleul/dpa-Zentralbild/ZB, Photograph: Rspca South Australia/Reutersthe week in wildlife in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-446": {"text": "\nReturn of the burbot: 'great lost fish' to be reintroduced to UK\n, Freshwater predatory cod species to make comeback after 50-year absence, \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 07.46 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 6 Mar 2020 13.25 EST\n\n, Forget dreams of wolves, bears or lynx – the next animal to be restored to the British countryside could be a river bottom-dwelling fish that resembles a giant tadpole., The burbot, much-maligned for its unprepossessing appearance with a fleshy appendage dangling from its chin, was last sighted in British rivers in 1969., A reward for spotting it remains unclaimed and now a costed reintroduction plan is being drawn up for Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog., “The chance to bring back burbot to our rivers is hugely exciting,” said Jonah Tosney, operations director of the Norfolk Rivers Trust, which is masterminding the reintroduction plan. “Unlike beavers, lynx and sea eagles, they haven’t been gone for long; only about 50 years. Anglers still remember catching them. We’re hopeful that recent work to improve water quality and to restore habitat has brought our rivers back to a good enough state to support England’s great lost fish.”, The burbot, also known as the eelpout and the lingcod, disappeared at the same time as the otter vanished from waterways. In both cases, agricultural and heavy metal pollution may have played a role., Tosney said the cause of the burbot’s disappearance remained “a bit of a mystery” but was a combination of pressures including the disappearance of natural “messy” edges to rivers, including pools, flooded areas and back channels., “People did used to eat them but it’s more likely to be water quality and habitat quality slowly degrading since the second world war that caused their disappearance,” he said., The burbot, the only freshwater species of cod, once thrived at the bottom of cool lowland rivers across eastern England but leaves its preferred habitat for ponds and pools to spawn and so requires pools and other freshwater close to the river., Burbot could also be a beneficiary of beaver reintroductions, as the beavers create burbot-friendly habitat., The fish has been successfully reintroduced into Belgium and Germany, and Tosney said there were several river valleys in the East Anglian Fens with good floodplains that could be ideal habitat., Before the fish is brought back there will be further feasibility studies and also an environmental DNA survey to check there are no traces of burbot DNA in rivers, which would prove that a few survivors have evaded detection since the 1960s., The Norfolk Rivers Trust hopes to raise £80,000 to fund a five-year reintroduction pilot. Because of the high mortality rate for young fish, hundreds of thousands of young burbot will be first reared in captivity from eggs brought from European hatcheries., Dave Ottewell, a fish specialist for Natural England, said: “Over recent years great efforts have been made to restore our freshwater environment, rectifying some of the historic damage inflicted on these valuable and complex systems., “This work has focused on rebuilding the natural processes that underpin high quality freshwater habitats. It is the successful restoration of these habitats that has led us to a position where we can now realistically look towards the reintroduction of this recently lost species back into its native range.”, The reintroduction may worry trout fishermen in particular because the omnivorous burbot will eat trout., “They eat pretty much everything – invertebrates, other fish, and trout, no doubt about it, but trout will also eat burbot,” said Tosney. “Anglers do not like predators but I can’t see any other reason to object – it’s a native species, it should be here.”return of the burbot great lost fish to be reintroduced to uk", "label": 0}, "train-447": {"text": "Spring arrives earlier than ever recorded in southern US – adding to climate trend, Warming springs can cause plants to bloom earlier, alter hibernation times and locations for migrating animals, and increase insect populations, Across the south-eastern US, trees are unfurling their clouds of leaves after winter. Yet this picturesque and usually welcome development is this year cause for consternation., New data from the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) shows that in parts of North Carolina, South Carolina and northern Florida, spring has arrived more than three weeks earlier than average, and earlier than at any point in the last 39 years it has been tracked., The south-eastern US has historically experienced a large amount of variability in the onset of spring, so it is hard to say the climate crisis is directly responsible. Yet this year’s premature spring is part of a trend of rising temperatures and early leaf emergence that scientists have observed in recent years., Phenologists – who study seasonal phenomena in the natural world – calculate the start of spring based on observations of “leaf-outs” (the appearance of tiny leaves on trees), blooms for species active in early spring (such as lilac and honeysuckle) and weather events and temperature conditions. The Extended Spring Indices have been used as an indicator of climate change by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the National Climate Assessment., A 2016 study by the National Park Service found that of the 276 parks studied, three-quarters are experiencing the impacts of an early onset of spring, and half of the parks are experiencing an “extreme” early onset, as compared to historical averages. This 2020 early spring is currently affecting such beloved parks as Congaree in South Carolina and parts of Great Smoky Mountains on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina., Because plants and animals take their cues in part from seasonal rise of temperatures, warming springs can cause plants to bloom earlier, alter hibernation times and locations for migrating animals, and increase some insect populations. Plants blooming before their pollinators are available or aggressive seasonal insect populations can threaten agricultural yields and drive up food prices. And because the weather is still volatile at this time of year, subsequent cold temperatures can damage flowers and fruits. , Early spring can also impact recreation. In national parks, changes in seasonal timing affects the hiring seasonal staff and the management of invasive species and wildfire threats. And in Washington DC, for example, the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival is timed around updates from National Park Service horticulturalists on bloom development.

Guardian Australia has been told there is $1.75m unpaid from the original agreement., Some researchers said the decision made little sense given the hub’s work included areas of government interest, particularly the development of a clean hydrogen industry. Other hub projects focus on energy storage, energy system modelling, plans for a just transition to clean energy and integrating solar energy into the grid., Dylan McConnell, from the University of Melbourne’s climate and energy college, said: “It’s seems pretty hypocritical and counter-intuitive to be talking about this hydrogen and at the same time cutting funding.”, The email said the department had indicated it hoped the hub would “continue to deliver” but it wanted to “refocus” resources “at a time of tight budgets”. It said negotiations between the University of Melbourne and the department were under way, and the university was “looking at the options for different levels of support”., “Now, it is very early days to say what comes next,” the email, by hub managing director Rebecca Burdon and co-directors, Malte Meinshausen and Frank Jotzo, said., “We know that our contribution is filling a key niche in the Australian and international research landscape, on a topic that is continuing to gain in importance. And we know that we have a great group of researchers (you!) working on crucial issues, and that we’ve established powerful networks., “We also know that industry and most state governments, and many parts of the federal government, are keenly interested in the energy transition. And we know that the bilateral relationship between Australia and Germany is and remains important, including on energy. We will need to recalibrate our activities in order to maximise opportunities for alternative funding.”, The email said the department had noted in its reasoning that the German government had not continued funding for its side of the hub, which was for two and a half years. But it said the German institutes remained involved and were part of a separate upcoming major project funded by the government that was designed to advance the energy transition., On Friday night, a department spokesperson said the goals of the hub were to strengthen Australia’s bilateral relationship with Germany and better coordinate investments in research in energy transition. They said the remaining funding would be reallocated “to support our strategic priorities with Germany and other European partners more effectively, including potential collaboration with Germany on hydrogen”., Jotzo, Meinshausen and hub chairman Ross Garnaut declined to comment.morrison government to stop funding 20m international collaboration on shift to zero emissions", "label": 0}, "train-449": {"text": "\nA snowless winter around Europe – in pictures\n, A snowless winter around Europe – in pictures, Struggling ski resorts are having to get creative as slopes dry out during a record-breaking few months, , \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 02.00 EST\n\n, Photograph: David Gowans/Alamy, Photograph: Carlos L Vives/Alamy, Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Peter Schatz/Alamy, Photograph: Waltraud Grubitzsch/dpa-Zentralbild/ZB, Photograph: Régis Duvignau/Reuters, Photograph: Philipp Guelland/EPA, Photograph: Philipp Guelland/EPA, Photograph: Patrick Seeger/dpa/Alamy, Photograph: Karl-Josef Hildenbrand/dpa, Photograph: Uwe Zucchi/dpa/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/AP, Photograph: Stefan Ember/Alamy, Photograph: Barbara Gindl/APA/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Gwladys Fouche/Reuters, Photograph: Natalia Fedosenko/TASS/Getty Images, Photograph: Heikki Saukkomaa/AP, Photograph: Marcin Bielecki/EPAa snowless winter around europe in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-450": {"text": "\nCountry diary: village church with unusual adornment\n, Linkenholt, North Wessex Downs: The arched window is beaded with round, sea urchin fossils, known as shepherd’s crowns, \nNicola Chester, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 00.30 EST\n\n, Now that the pheasant shooting season is over, the beaters’ white plastic feed-bag flags remain furled around their hazel poles and tucked in welly racks outside every other cottage door.

The area has three commercial water mines with deep bores that send about 100m litres a year for bottling., Residents told Guardian Australia last year the situation at Tamborine Mountain had become “dire”., There is also growing concern about water extraction plans in the Springbrook Plateau, where two large extraction operations have licences and another was recently blocked by the Gold Coast council., The government’s announcement will prohibit any new commercial bores in the Tamborine Mountain and Springbrook areas for at least the next year., Most of the groundwater extracted at Tamborine – about 84% – is used by farmers. Farmers and households will be exempt from the moratorium., “I appreciate that local residents have concerns about the impact of commercial bottling on groundwater resources at Tamborine and Springbrook,” the Queensland natural resources minister, Anthony Lynham, said. “Good decisions are made on the facts, and we need more facts about how much groundwater is being used, and by whom, to get a clearer picture., “This moratorium will prevent any new developments while the state works with the local councils and the community to identify the best way to manage the areas’ water.”, Under the plan, local businesses and farmers will be required to report their water usage to assist in research., The concerns of residents have been compounded by a lack of definitive study about groundwater recharge, which would allow authorities to better understand whether underground supplies are replenished through rainfall., While limited previous research has indicated that commercial water supplies are renewable and the industry is sustainable, the severe impact of the recent drought has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the situation., A 2011 Tamborine Mountain study by researchers at the Queensland University of Technology found that less than 5% of annual groundwater recharge was being extracted. , The study assessed just 50 bores, in a town where many bores are decades-old or not registered, and estimates of the total vary between 500 and 3,000. It noted that “philosophical questions around commercial sale of groundwater are very valid but beyond the scope of this report”., Last year the Tamborine Mountain state school ran out of water, and the government had to truck bottles to the community.

Gas is sometimes called on by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) to boost grid security, but Saddler said this role was expected to decline as new transmission interconnection was built between states and regions., He said the idea gas would be a transition fuel in the Australian market was nearly 20 years out of date. “The ISP results from Aemo’s integrated system plan for the grid show very clearly there is a transition from coal to renewables without going via gas under all the scenarios,” Saddler said., A spokesman for the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the Aemo modelling highlighted demand for gas generation as a balance to variable renewable generation was expected to increase. He emphasised that the gas projects shortlisted for the government underwriting program were not combined cycle plants, but “highly flexible, fast start” technology that were particularly well suited to complementing renewable energy., Saddler said the first point was misleading. He said the Aemo modelling suggested gas generation would decline over the next decade even as coal plants closed before rebounding in the late 2030s to a level that would still be less than today., Saddler said the flexible gas plants already in the grid were also running well below capacity. He pointed to 31 January this year, the second highest day for electricity demand on record, when the maximum gas generation from both combined-cycle and flexible generators reached 7.6 gigawatts, well below the grid’s total gas-fired capacity of 11.4 gigawatts ., Richie Merzian, Australia Institute’s climate and energy director, said the grid’s gas plants were mostly built 10 to 20 years ago, when it was assumed the price of gas would come down and that gas would play a significant role as a transition fuel during the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy., “In reality, gas is expensive, it’s high-polluting and, as this research shows, it is under-performing,” he said. “Given this, why would we underwrite new gas-fired plants?”, Gas-fired power is usually said to have about half the emissions of coal-fired generation, but some studies have found this does not factor in the amount of methane – a highly potent, but relatively short-lived, greenhouse gas – that leaks into the atmosphere during extraction and from pipelines., According to Aemo’s modelling, the grid is likely to need between 5 gigawatts and 21 gigawatts of new “flexible, dispatchable” generation by 2040. It lists large-scale pumped hydro and battery storage, small-scale batteries and demand reductions programs as likely sources., It found new, flexible gas generators could also play a role “if gas prices materially reduce”. The wholesale price of gas has roughly tripled over the past decade., Taylor’s spokesman cited a recent grid report card by the government’s Energy Security Board that raised concerns about maintaining security and reliability when wind and solar were not available. “The government has consistently prioritised action to encourage new, reliable supply, including pumped hydro, like Snowy 2.0, and flexible gas,” he said., Tony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, said the underwriting program was a bad idea as it distorted the market and discouraged private investment, and a carbon price remained the best way to drive a shift to net zero emissions., He said gas was likely to play a role in the transition to a clean grid, but decisions on whether to invest in gas, or any technology, were best made by energy companies in the context of a clear climate policy., “Then if people want to invest in new gas-fired power stations to balance the system and they are prepared to pay for that and think they can make that work, I don’t see any reason why they shouldn’t do that,” Wood said. “But the government shouldn’t be paying for it or underwriting it.”expensive and underperforming energy audit finds gas power running well below capacity", "label": 0}, "train-454": {"text": "\n'I'm profoundly sad, I feel guilty': scientists reveal personal fears about the climate crisis\n, Feelings of powerlessness and despair for the future are evident in letters written for a six-year ‘passion project’ , \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nSat 7 Mar 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 7 Mar 2020 16.19 EST\n\n, In 2014, Joe Duggan started reaching out to climate scientists to ask them a question: how did climate change make them feel?, “I was just blown away when I started getting the letters back,” he says., Duggan, a science communicator at Australian National University, set up a website and starting publishing the mostly handwritten responses., “Professor Katrin Meissner was one of the first, and her letter really hit me. It was so ... unscience-y. Almost poetic.”, “It makes me feel sad. And it scares me,” Meissner wrote., “It scares me more than anything else. I see a group of people sitting in a boat, happily waving, taking pictures on the way, not knowing that this boat is floating right into a powerful and deadly waterfall.”, In the end, more than 40 scientists responded – many leaders in their field. Some wrote neatly on lined notepaper, others scrawled on the back of student papers they were marking., “It became a big part of my life,” Duggan says. “I felt a little bit out of my depth. It took its toll on me and in the end I felt I had to step away. I went into my shell and pretty much turned off my phone for three years., “But I’ve got some emotional resilience back now. My partner and I found out we’re pregnant – due in August. I don’t want that kid to grow up asking why we didn’t actually do anything.”, So Duggan has returned to his “passion project” – Is This How You Feel – by asking the scientists to write again. Have their feelings changed in the intervening years?, The first 10 return letters are emotional outpourings of despair, hope, fear and determination in the age of the climate crisis, from the people helping the world understand its impacts while also being mums, dads and grandparents., Since the first letters were written, two Australian correspondents Tony McMichael and Michael Raupach have died. But Duggan is trying to reach their family members to see if they can keep the legacy moving., Meissner, now director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, didn’t hesitate to respond partly because “it was the right thing to do”., When these people start to speak up about being frustrated, desperate, worried, angry or scared, then we really should listen very carefully, “But also because we have not been very good at communicating climate science to the public and I believe that it is my duty as a citizen to alert people to the urgency of the situation.”, But does Meissner think there’s a risk in scientists lifting their veil of cool objectivity to show their personal feelings? Could it cause some to question their objectivity?, “I actually think that the opposite is the case,” she says. “When I saw the whole collection of letters a few years ago, I was surprised by the number of colleagues who had participated., “We are talking here about world-leading scientists, people who built their career on facts and data, who are spending their lives questioning every result they find, over and over again. People who are continuously challenging the status quo. People who are trained to be objective., “When these people start to speak up about their feelings, about being frustrated, desperate, worried, angry or scared, then we really should listen very carefully.”, Duggan wants anyone who has read the letters to write their own, and share them. Here are some excerpts from the latest scientist letters from Duggan’s project., How do I feel about it? I am still very worried. I am also profoundly sad. I am probably sadder than I was five years ago., I feel powerless and, to a certain extent, guilty. I feel like I have failed my duty as a citizen and as a mother because I was not able to communicate the urgency of the situation well enough to trigger meaningful action in time.What we are doing right now is an uncontrolled, risky experiment with the planet we live on., I’m angry because the lack of effective action on climate change, despite the wealth not only of scientific information but also of solutions to reduce emissions, has now created a climate emergency., The students are right. Their future is now being threatening by the greed of the wealthy fossil fuel elite, the lies of the Murdoch press, and the weakness of our political leaders. These people have no right to destroy my daughter’s future and that of her generation., My emotions haven’t really changed since I last wrote one of these letters, but things around me have. The beacon of light that is Greta Thunberg, speaking truth to power. Our own wonderful, passionate school kids taking to the streets, making me cry with pride. The only way to cope with all of this is to focus on what I can do, what I’m best at, and hope like hell that enough people, doing what they do best, can overcome., I have some very dark moments, but more than ever before, I feel wrapped in a blanket of collective determination. Hope is a necessary emotion, but more than that, it must be our fundamental strategy to keep us going. Lose it, and we are lost., For the most part my comments of 19 September 2014 still apply except that the glimmer of hope has diminished if not vanished entirely. With Obama as US president and the Paris agreement in late 2015, a glimmer of hope seemed to emerge, but with Trump and his ignorant accomplices, the hope has vanished., I am close to retirement and as I was cleaning up in 2019 I found some old VHS tapes recording me on shows, such as the Lehrer News Hour on PBS in 1988, and the message then was much the same as now except we are now more confident and the progress has been nil. It was depressing. My solution has been to move back to New Zealand along with my daughter and family (grandchildren)., Realistically, we are already too late to meet a 1.5 degree target and will struggle to achieve 2 degrees.So, the future, basically, looks bad.

Frustrated, angry that our science is ignored by politicians, scared for my husband and all the others who are on the frontline fighting these fires and trying to help., But mostly I feel devastated for my son, and his generation, who will have to heal this planet and live with the mass environmental destruction we have caused., I feel scared for the future when faced with simple downright ignorance from some political leaders.I feel tired, tired that in spite of bushfires, floods etc I still seem to be banging my head against a brick wall to convince people that the threat of climate change is severe.I feel relieved that now I am retired I don’t have to live and breathe this every minute of every day.I feel guilty that I am stepping back from the frontline, so even though I am retired I feel compelled to carry on working.I feel unspeakable joy at the news that I am to become a grandfather for the first time, but fearful of the world my grandchild will grow up in., I feel relieved that when my grandchild grows up and asks me why we did nothing to stop climate change I can at least say that I did my best.As I sit writing this on a bench looking out over the moors I feel uplifted that despite everything the world is still the most beautiful place., The full collection of letters is available at Is This How You Feel.im profoundly sad i feel guilty scientists reveal personal fears about the climate crisis", "label": 0}, "train-455": {"text": "\nBrexit 'opportunity to ban supertrawlers from UK waters'\n, Environmental groups fear link between huge ships and spikes in dolphin deaths, \nMattha Busby, \n\nSat 7 Mar 2020 08.31 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Sat 7 Mar 2020 06.12 EST\n\n, Brexit offers the perfect opportunity to ban industrial supertrawler fishing boats from UK waters, according to campaigners., The factory-sized ships can be hundreds of feet long and have been criticised for indiscriminate fishing as they catch hundreds of thousands of fish in relatively short periods. Environmentalists fear their presence correlates with spikes in numbers of dolphins washing up dead., Use of the ships is heavily regulated in some countries, as trawling has been criticised for the physical damage it inflicts on seabeds, but under the common fisheries policy, EU-registered vessels are legally entitled to fish in UK waters, subject to licence conditions, quota allocation and relevant fishing restrictions., Campaigners fear supertrawlers are incompatible with sustainable management of fisheries and argue that the UK’s departure from the EU presents an opportunity for a new approach, as fishing rights to British waters are up for review., “Our government likes to boast about its credentials as a global oceans champion, but what about protecting our seas here at home?” said Chris Thorne, Greenpeace’s oceans campaigner., “Ministers should take a long, hard look at whether allowing supertrawlers to operate in UK waters is compatible with sustainable management of our waters, as well as investigating the impact of the UK’s industrial distant-water fleet in other countries’ waters.”, Calls for a ban on supertrawlers were made last year when the Lithuanian-registered Margiris – a 142-metre (465ft) boat with a deadweight of 6,200 tonnes, once considered the second largest in the world and banned from Australian waters – spent time off the south coast of England., According to analysis by Greenpeace, Margiris was fishing in an area of the Channel designated by the government as a marine conservation zone. However, the government said it was monitored closely and no infringements were found., The overall number of voyages in UK waters by supertrawlers each year is unclear, but conservationists claim that anecdotal evidence suggests the ships wreak havoc on sea life., “It’s just been a long stream of dolphin deaths, I have never seen anything quite like it,” said John Hourston, from the Blue Planet Society. “We have had several storms but dolphins do not die because of weather, they are great swimmers.”, He believes the evidence points to supertrawlers being responsible for an increase in stranded dolphins off the Sussex coast and the west of Ireland, but that scientific study is needed to incontrovertibly prove the link. , “We have just got mass dolphin die-offs and mass fishing fleets and the two correlate, but we need more evidence.”, At the very least, he said, these ships should fitted with CCTV cameras or have independent observers on board to monitor which fish are being caught., “I am not talking about the inshore fishermen, I am talking about the industrial supertrawler fleets,” he said. “We should not be allowing supertrawlers in British waters.”, French campaigners have also highlighted how rising numbers of dead dolphins are being washed up on the coast of the Bay of Biscay after becoming caught up in large trawler nets. In 2017, researchers said the number of dead dolphins washing up on British and French shores was at its highest level in more than 14 years, echoing observations from Ireland. , The website of fishing company Parlevliet &amp; Van der Plas, the owner of the Margiris, says it has an “excellent reputation for sustainable fishing”., It added: “Our catch quotas are dictated by government and EU regulations, and are based on scientific advice. We fish without causing damage to the seabed, and without disturbing the ecological system.”, A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “As an independent coastal state, we will have the right to decide who fishes in our waters and on what terms., “This means we can design our own domestic fishing policy, one that supports our coastal communities and lets the UK lead the way on sustainable fishing.”, • This article was amended on 9 March 2020 to remove a reference to the Hull-based Kirkella because the trawler does not operate in UK waters.ban supertrawlers from uk waters after brexit say green campaigners", "label": 0}, "train-456": {"text": "\nMore cows than people: America's beef capital of the world – in pictures\n, More cows than people: America's beef capital of the world – in pictures, The Texas Panhandle is cattle-feeding country, with tiny towns with names such as Hereford and Bovina reflecting local pride.

This wide-open landscape, with its voluptuous green curves, makes good hare country. I’ve seen them often in the low light of winter mornings, loping through the dew-spangled grass, or casting long shadows in the late afternoon as the sun is winding down. It’s breeding season at the moment, which means they’re more visible than usual. They gather in small parties, box, and chase their ladyfolk around., A few days ago, snatching at a break in the weather, I was out on horseback and riding down one of the muddy grass tracks that lie squeezed between drystone dykes. Kicking on into a canter, we had taken only a few strides when both horse and rider were startled by a flash of movement as what I’d taken for a molehill burst into life and galloped away. A strange, unsettling sensation: the earth seemed to shift and move underfoot. But it was only a hare, taking flight., We meant him no harm, of course, but there was no telling him that. He thundered down the track ahead of us – long ears erect and those powerful hind legs cycling, faster than a speeding car.

His intervention followed a surge in vandalism at such sites, triggered in part by the new-found popularity of exploring abandoned buildings., Last month it emerged that Shotton steelworks in north Wales – one of the society’s 10 most endangered buildings in 2018 – had been badly damaged. According to reports, vandals had knocked down partition walls, destroyed ornate panelling, and kicked in walls. Several fires had been lit and tiles thrown off the roof., The Grade II-listed Tolly Cobbold brewery in Ipswich, which featured in the society’s 2015 top 10, suffered a major blaze last month. Two men in their 20s and a woman in her 40s were arrested on suspicion of arson and have been released pending further inquiries., And last April, the Fisons factory in Bramford, described as “an irreplaceable part of Suffolk’s heritage” and featured in the society’s 2017 top 10, was burned to the ground by arsonists., The vandalised buildings have often lain empty for years while their owners try to balance their plans for redevelopment against conservation restrictions., The society says councils warn owners to improve security, but action is rarely taken. “Buildings under threat need strong security,” Rhys Jones said. “They need maintenance. They need alarms and lighting. Most of all they need concerted imagination and help to be brought back into the community quickly.”, The Victorian Society uses its top 10 endangered buildings campaign to highlight what it deems are the UK’s most “in danger” buildings. The society believes it is up to councils, once warned, to ensure the derelict buildings are properly secured., “Personally, I am frightened by empty buildings,” Rhys Jones said. “They gradually sink. They become a lure to intruders.” The vogue for exploring abandoned buildings – sometimes referred to as Urbex or urban exploration – carries new threats, he believes., Books such as No Voice from the Hall: Early Memories of a Country House, by John Harris, who visited more than 200 empty country houses in the postwar years, popularised the practice more than half a century ago. Now, thanks to the internet, there has been an explosion in what Rhys Jones calls “exploratory break-ins”. There are numerous websites dedicated to the urbex craze., “They can feature stunning photos that make the act of entering a deserted building seem an adventure, but for every visitor who has a respect for the building, there might also be one who destroys what they find or steals what they can sell. Some of them simply torch what is there. The truth is that most culprits are aged 14-16. This is thrill-seeking opportunism, isn’t it?”, The actor and comedian acknowledged re-educating teenagers about the dangers their actions posed historic buildings was a long shot. “But,” he added, “proper safeguards are not.”, He calls on planners and owners, developers and legislators to start looking at better “temporary-use proposals” for the buildings. “If conversion is needed, it is a long and painful process,” Rhys Jones said. Gaining planning permission to convert for commercial premises can take two years to process, he said. “Even security measures require lengthy planning applications. If a listed building can stay used, surely it will have a better chance of living on.”victorian buildings under attack vandals arsonists griff rhys jones", "label": 0}, "train-459": {"text": "\nIndian Ocean system that drives extreme weather in Australia likely to worsen with global heating\n, Researchers believe the Indian Ocean Dipole is more clearly influenced by climate change than previously thought, \nLisa Cox, \n\nMon 9 Mar 2020 13.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 9 Mar 2020 13.10 EDT\n\n, Indian Ocean surface temperatures that helped drive hot and dry conditions in eastern Australia last year were more clearly influenced by climate change than previously thought and are likely to worsen in future, researchers have found., Scientists studying a phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole say their observations suggest Australia could experience future conditions even more extreme than those that elevated the bushfire risk during the 2019-20 fire season., The work, led by the Australian National University and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, used coral records from the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean to examine the occurrence of “extreme positive” Indian Ocean Dipole events over the past millennium., The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is the difference in temperature between the western and eastern Indian Ocean. When the IOD is in positive mode, warmer waters develop off the Horn of Africa and cooler waters develop off Indonesia. This leads to hotter and drier weather in Australia., An “extreme positive” event is when these conditions are particularly severe. Last year, an extreme positive IOD played a role in bushfires in Australia and floods in Africa., The scientists used fossil and modern coral cores to examine how frequently these events occurred back to 1240. Analysing data from 500 of those years, they found an extreme positive Indian Ocean Dipole like the one Australia experienced in 2019 was rare, occurring just 10 times., Lead author Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University , said four of the extreme positives were in the past 60 years., “We’ve seen these events becoming more frequent and our climate models suggest that’s a response to human-caused climate change,” she said., The strongest event on the instrumental record occurred in 1997. But using the coral records the researchers were able to find another more extreme case in 1675., Abram said this was one of the most concerning aspects of their findings., “We expect these events to continue becoming more frequent in future,” she said., “But one of the worrying aspects of our findings was that the largest events in our observations over recent decades weren’t as extreme as these events can get., “So it’s possible to have even more extreme events than what we’ve witnessed in recent decades.”, The findings, published in Nature, are the largest record developed for the Indian Ocean Dipole. Other research has also suggested that Indian Ocean Dipole events have become more frequent in recent decades., “When we have these events we have hot and dry conditions in Australia,” Abram said., “In 2019 that elevated the bushfire risk in southeastern Australia and then we obviously saw the devastating effects that had over summer.”, She said the new research showed countries needed to be aware that “recent decades don’t give us the full range of the risk these events pose”. But stabilising global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions would also stabilise how often we experience these events in future., A co-author of the paper, Matthew England, said the research also found a strong coupling between variability in the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean., While IOD and El Niño events can occur independently of each other, periods of large year-to-year swings in Indian Ocean variability “also had heightened ENSO variability in the Pacific”., “Looking at the tropical oceans in this interconnected way improves our understanding of seasonal to decadal climate variations in regions that profoundly impact Australia,” England said., He said this could help Australia “to be better prepared for future climate risks caused by the Indian Ocean Dipole”., , , indian ocean system that drives extreme weather in australia likely to worsen with global heating", "label": 0}, "train-460": {"text": "\nOn a roll: is Britain ready for reusable toilet paper?\n, Coronavirus fears have led to a run on loo paper as shoppers stockpile. But are fabric, washable cloths a sustainable alternative?, \nLucy Siegle, \n\nMon 9 Mar 2020 12.54 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 9 Mar 2020 18.05 EDT\n\n, Mostly, these are the worst of times, but for loo roll purveyors and disruptors it will never be better. Sales are up and supermarket shelves are empty as more and more shoppers stockpile. So we should not be surprised by the rise of reusable toilet roll – squares of washable textiles that are linked together with plastic poppers and sold on sites such as Etsy., If you are, like me, invested in a sustainable lifestyle, the idea is quite thrilling. Reusable represents the gold standard of eco-engineering. Everything that is made and used has an eco footprint, which includes the energy used to create the thing in the first place. Single-use products are the worst, recycled a close second., Historically, squeamishness has put some products out of the reach of reusable design, but this is changing. The product designer Isabel Aagaard of LastObject claims to have sold more than 125,000 units of a reusable cotton bud (since March last year). The same company recently brought out a reusable tissue, which people my age still call a handkerchief. Then there are mooncups instead of tampons and, of course, a long tradition in reusable nappies., But are we ready for washable loo roll? The farcical supply chain of toilet roll is certainly ready for disruption: dead-tree paper (or sawdust) is carted across the world, wrapped in plastic and lined up for sale. Even the most ethical versions such as Who Gives a Crap have to be transported (by ship) and delivered to homes in vans. All paper-making is water-intensive, too., The reusable fabric roll kicks all this into touch. Bidets and flannels have previously been touted as the most eco route, but the lifecycle analysis (the process of adding up all the energy costs) of using and washing them is contentious. One Defra study from 2008 put the dampener on eco nappies, saying they used more energy than disposable ones because parents would typically tumble-dry them. The same may well be true for reusable loo roll – even if many devotees only use them for number ones. They will undoubtedly need to be washed at a high temperature – which takes a great a deal of energy. Questions also need to be asked about whether detergents need to be used and do the textiles shed microplastics when washed?, Habit and tradition will ultimately decide whether reusable loo roll catches on. The earliest advert I can find on a perforated roll of paper in the UK is in the Lichfield Mercury from 1885. One Frederic Brown (really) guarantees “satisfaction” through the promise of a neat contrivance to replace the standard packet of paper. He cleverly sold a 100-sheet perforated roll with a handsome holder (cost: 2 shillings)., What he understood was that if you want to change a habit, you need to sell a whole system. Today’s disruptors shouldn’t just be selling the squares of textile, but also the hamper that can be closed and easily carried to the washing machine. For mass uptake, they probably need to think bigger than the square.on a roll is britain ready for reusable toilet paper", "label": 0}, "train-461": {"text": "\n'Our worst-case scenario is Britain's too': German fears for fishing industry\n, At a herring processing plant in Rügen, continued access for trawlers to British waters is crucial for the business to survive, \nPhilip Oltermann in Sassnitz, \n\nMon 9 Mar 2020 08.17 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 9 Mar 2020 16.50 EDT\n\n, When a Danish trawler docks on the island of Rügen in the early hours of a stormy Thursday morning, the Euro-Baltic plant at Sassnitz-Mukran suddenly jolts to life., Via a network of subterranean tubes, 1,400 tonnes of slippery North Sea herring are pumped from the belly of the ship and belched out onto an assembly line inside the factory on Germany’s largest island, where the silvery-blue fish are blow-dried, weighed, gutted and either sliced into fillets or chopped into bite-sized chunks., Forty hours earlier, these oily foragers were basking off the coast of the Shetland Islands. Thanks to the European Union’s common fisheries policy (CFP), they now float in vats of marinade, gently shaken every six hours by a robot to spread the brine. Some of them will soon be ready to be wrapped around slices of pickled gherkin to become rollmops, a popular German hangover cure., If Boris Johnson’s government were to have its way, however, the assembly line at Sassnitz-Mukran could soon come to a halt. As negotiations on post-Brexit fishing rights get under way , the UK has reaffirmed its intention to become an independent coastal state when the extension period ends this year., Operating under the UN convention on the law of the sea rather than the CFP, Britain would have control over an exclusive economic zone up to 200 nautical miles off its shore and wants to annually set its own quotas for those it allows to fish in its waters., With the promise to “take back control” resonating particularly loudly in totemic Brexit-supporting fishing communities such as Grimsby, this is likely to mean preferred access to British fishermen and pushing out EU boats., The fear at the herring processing plant on Rügen is that it won’t even come to that. “The worst-case scenario if we get a hard Brexit after all, without an agreement on fishing rights,”said Uwe Richter, the factory’s director, “is we’d lose our access rights to the British economic area in an instant and wouldn’t have any opportunities to bring in any herring in the second half of the year.”, In theory, under such a scenario it would be possible for Scottish trawlers to deliver herring to Rügen instead. But if a bust-up over fishing rights were to derail negotiations over a trade deal between Britain and the EU, it could quickly spell trouble for Euro-Baltic., “If there is no trade deal we get whacked with tariffs and paperwork, so the herring stinks to the heavens by the time it arrives and the whole business becomes unaffordable,” Richter said. “Herring is a very sensitive fish. You can’t afford to transport it from auction to auction. If you want a good product, you need the shortest routes possible.”, Such fears are shared in Berlin’s seats of power. The German government believes the explosive debate around fishing, which makes up only 0.1% of the UK’s economy and 0.02% of Germany’s, has the potential to sour the tone of more important negotiations, such as over trade, security cooperations and financial services., “If the negotiations get bogged down on fishing, which is not crucial economically but highly symbolic and emotive, it becomes harder to have a more sober debate further down the line,” said a German official familiar with the talks., Part of the problem is that fish, and herring in particular, is not just a highly symbolic subject for Britain, but also for the woman at the top of Germany’s government. The Euro-Baltic plant lies in Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I, which has since 1990 been the constituency of Angela Merkel., What locals here call “the silver of the sea” has been a key industry in the region for centuries. Some of the small herring-fishing villages on Rügen’s northernmost tip date back to the 12th century, and the industry blossomed again during the time of the German Democratic Republic, when East Germany’s socialist regime invested heavily in expanding ocean fishing., Franz Plaep, 82, a retired trawler captain, remembers the 1950s as the island’s “golden era”, when Sassnitz harbour was home to 200 vessels that sailed as far as Africa or New York, and fishermen had one of the few profession in the one-party state that knew no borders., This is Europe is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. , After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fishing industry on Rügen collapsed with the same speed as many of East Germany’s other state-run industries., In Sassnitz harbour, one company still sells soused, pickled or smoked herring its cutters catch off the island’s coast as a local delicacy in a company-owned shop, but only a small share of the fleet’s catch is exported off the island. A group of fishermen in Rügen’s north-west are hoping to turn tinned herring into a luxury product in the way the Portuguese have managed with sardines, though the scale of their enterprise is even more limited., In the seaside bar where Franz Plaep and his former colleagues meet every morning from 8 til 9 for a coffee, there is a famous photograph on the wall that shows a young Angela Merkel talking to local fishermen in a hut in the village of Lobbe. The photo was taken in 1990, when she was 36 years old. The fisherman’s hut has since shut down, like many others; of about 2,000 fishing businesses that existed on the island in 1990, barely 100 remain., When Dutch multinational Parlevliet &amp; Van der Plas (P&amp;P) built the Euro-Baltic processing plant in 2003, it became a crucial crutch for a regional economy in structural decline. With 140 full-time employees and 80 seasonal contract workers, it is one of the biggest employers on the island., Local authorities had managed to entice P&amp;P to the island with EU grants and by helping to procure scientific permits to reclaim the plot of land from the sea on which the plant now sits., In 2020, however, Brexit is one of two developments threatening to kick the last legs from under Rügen’s remaining fishing industry. Catchment quotas for the Baltic sea, set by Brussels on the advice of maritime scientists, have shrunk dramatically in recent years, down 65% from last year, to 1,700 tonnes. In 2003, fishermen were still allowed to fish 35,000 tones of herring out of the Baltic. The reasons behind the decline of stocks are unclear, with speculative fingers pointed at global warming, noisy sub-aquatic building works around the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and a growing population of hungry seals., “The quota may go up again, of course,” said Uwe Richter. “But when you are at such a low level it may take longer than we can afford to wait.” Processing different fish instead, such as anchovies or red mullet, is not an option – the high-tech machinery inside the plant is tailored towards slender herring. For now, the viability of his business is reliant on access to British waters. “Without them, we run the risk that the plant will be at a standstill for long periods.”, Merkel appears to be aware of their plight. In Germany’s federalised political system, delegates are not expected to parade local issues into the business of the Bundestag in the way they are in Westminster. But in her role as environment minister under Helmut Kohl and later as chancellor, Merkel has frequently visited fishermen on the shores of the Baltic Sea, most recently in 2015, when she christened “Mark”, one of the large trawlers in Euro-Baltic’s fleet that could from next year be barred from British waters., The threat posed to the local fishing industry by Britain’s exit from the EU, people on the island say, has been on the chancellor’s mind since the UK voted to leave. Her chief of staff visited Euro-Baltic as soon as Brexit negotiations started in earnest, and in the 2017 coalition treaty between Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic party, the word “Brexit” appears only once – under the chapter heading “Fishing, Angling and Aquaculture”., If there’s still hope in Sassnitz, it’s because there is an expectation that the Brits will come to recognise the absurdity of the situation. One of the quirks of European cuisine is that both Germany and Britain’s culinary habits are not matched to the maritime fauna at its disposal. Herring plays a minor role on British menus, and the cod used for fish and chips is largely caught in waters off Scandinavia. In Germany, meanwhile, herring remains one of the three most popular types of fish on the menu., If British fishermen want to sell the fish in their seas, they will not only need some form of easy access to EU markets, but also trawlers of the size and processing infrastructure of the scale provided by Euro-Baltic., Britain could try to build its own processing capacity, perhaps even buying out large Dutch companies such as P&amp;P or Cornelis Vrolijk that dominate the trade, suggests Rodney Forster, a marine scientist at the University of Hull department., “Could the UK build factory freezer trawlers and processing facilities, and find markets for a large-scale pelagic fishery? Or more likely, could the UK simply buy out P&amp;P and re-flag some of its vessels as UK, and move processing to the UK? Could Grimsby be expanded as a fish processing base?” Financially, that seems possible, he adds. “But would Britain perform such a volte face in industrial policy for such a small sector of the economy? I would be surprised.”, For now, Uwe Richter reckons, a no-deal Brexit would be bad news for both herring handlers in the Baltic and the North Sea. “Our worst-case scenario is also the worst-case scenario for British fishermen.”worst case scenario britains too german fears fishing industry brexit", "label": 0}, "train-462": {"text": "\n‘We need to be heard’: the BAME climate activists who won’t be ignored\n, People of colour are more likely to be affected by the climate crisis, and yet they are often erased from the debate. A new wave of activists hopes to change that, \nSirin Kale, \n\nMon 9 Mar 2020 05.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 9 Mar 2020 06.31 EDT\n\n, In January, after she posed for a photo in Davos alongside Greta Thunberg and several other white climate campaigners, the Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate was dismayed to see that the Associated Press news agency had cropped her out of the image. It started a global conversation about how the voices of black, Asian and minority ethnic people are erased from the climate crisis movement., Climate activism has historically been perceived as a white, middle-class pursuit, but nothing could be further from the truth. Across the UK, BAME people are at the forefront of the fight against the climate crisis. Now, their efforts are being recognised by the Climate Reframe Project, an initiative spotlighting BAME voices in climate activism, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Solberga Foundation, and put together by the team behind former Irish president Mary Robinson’s Mothers of Invention podcast. Today, it features a list of the leading figures in the UK, some of whom shared their stories with me., Why have BAME activists so often been ignored? “Historically, the environmental movement comes from a white, privileged background,” says Suzanne Dhaliwal, 37, who is researching BAME representation in the climate justice movement at the University of Brighton. “But climate change mostly affects people in the global south, so it’s fair to elevate those voices.”, Many of the people I speak to have at times felt excluded. Nish Doshi is a 32-year-old climate justice organiser from Edinburgh. When Doshi – who is non-binary, and uses they/them pronouns – goes to Cop26 organising meetings for civil society alongside NGO leaders, they often find they are one of the few BAME people in the room. “There will be 50 or 60 people there, and hardly any people of colour,” they say. “They don’t even think about that at all.”, Criticism has also been levelled at Extinction Rebellion (XR), with BAME people pointing out that its tactic of encouraging protesters to get arrested ignores the reality that people of colour are disproportionately likely to be targeted in their interactions with police., Yet BAME people have been central to climate activism for decades. Farhana Yamin, 55, is the international climate lawyer responsible for getting the target of net zero emissions by 2050 included in the Paris accord. She came up with the goal after growing tired of the incremental advances promised by the carbon emission trading system. “I wanted to think bolder and bigger – no more mucking around with carbon budgets,” Yamin says. “These gases are toxic. We shouldn’t create trading systems for toxic pollutants.”, Recent years have seen the movement work to address its diversity problem. “When Vanessa was cropped out of that photo, that brought about a lot of healthy debate,” says Tyrone Scott, 28, an activist from London. He has been working tirelessly to get younger people into the movement, going into pupil referral units to teach students about the climate emergency. “They are so engaged,” Scott says. “It gives you so much hope for the future.”, The 16-year-old Londoner Jessica Ahmed says she used to think: “Climate change doesn’t affect me. It’s not an African-person problem.” But she became an activist after attending the May 2019 school climate strikes. “I’ve never fallen behind with school,” she says. “I think I’m more on track than most people who don’t go on the strikes.” She now organises for the UK Student Climate Network, mobilising her classmates. “It sucks that we have to miss school,” she says. “But we need to make our voices heard because it’s us that are going to be the most affected by climate change.”, Like Ahmed, the Manchester-based pupil Lillia Adetero, aged 10, has been striking from school, attending the Fridays for Future protests since January 2019. She often gives speeches at these strikes. “I talk about how climate change is going to affect our future and how the government isn’t doing enough,” she says. Adetero was delighted by the court of appeal ruling against the third Heathrow runway. “I’m very happy that Heathrow has been cancelled,” she says. “I’d like them to stop the Manchester airport expansion, too.”, Others are trying to change the system from within. Scott stood as a Green MP candidate in Hackney South in 2019, doubling the party’s share of the vote. “It was a good experience,” he says. “But I was relieved the day after the election, I’m not going to lie. I was out every day, delivering thousands of leaflets for 10 hours at a time.”, Fatima Ibrahim, 27, from London, is a codirector of the Green New Deal UK, which lobbies for the British government to put the climate crisis at the heart of the economic system, rather than seeing it as a stand-alone issue. “We have an economic system that isn’t working for the climate,” she says. “We need a system-wide change.” Her activism is cutting through: the Green New Deal was included in the 2019 Labour and Green manifestos., Many BAME activists feel a connection to the cause because they have family members in the vulnerable global south. Ibrahim is of Somalian heritage; her parents moved to the UK from Canada when she was nine. Climate activism has been her life’s work. “I was that crazy nine-year-old who watched Newsnight,” she says. “Coming from a refugee family made me aware of everything that was going on in the world. And it became clear to me that climate change was the biggest threat to people everywhere. If you care about injustice or refugees, all of those things will be 100 times worse if we don’t deal with the climate crisis.” She sees her Muslim faith as integral to her activism. “I have a responsibility for the people around me and a commitment to my community and other people,” she says., Other activists have turned to nonviolent direct action to force the government to pay attention. Yamin joined XR after becoming depressed by Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris accord, and the release of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2018 that warned we had only 12 years to avert climate catastrophe. “I fell into a state of real depression – actual depression – which I’d never had before,” says Yamin. “I felt that we had failed. We hadn’t saved the world at all. It felt really bleak.”, Direct action felt like a necessary corrective. “Our laws were being flouted,” says Yamin. “Laws that I helped put in place were being totally ignored.” She attended a number of XR direct actions. “I tried being arrested a few times and failed,” she jokes. “I thought: ‘I have to work harder at this being-arrested thing.’” Eventually, her wish was granted: Yamin was arrested after gluing herself to the Shell headquarters as part of the April 2019 XR protests., But it’s possible to make a difference in less dramatic ways. “It was amazing,” says 38-year-old Dave Fuller, from London, of his experience cooking for the anti-fracking protesters at the Preston New Road site near Blackpool. “When people are doing frontline work, all they want at the end of the day is a hot meal. I went up worrying that people would feel like I wasn’t fulfilling my part, but everyone was thankful someone was willing to turn up with hot food on a cold day.” He now works for Repowering, an initiative bringing affordable renewable energy to local communities., The law can also be a powerful tool. When Tessa Khan, a 37-year-old lawyer from London, heard about a landmark case brought by 900 Dutch citizens against their government for failing to uphold its climate commitments, she phoned the lawyers working on it. “I thought they were amazing,” says Khan. She went on to cofound the Climate Litigation Network, which helps citizens around the world to sue their governments on climate-crisis-related issues., The climate movement is massively growing. We’re reaching new people, “The gap between what the governments are supposed to be doing to stop global warming and what they are actually doing is growing by the day,” says Khan. Her team of four lawyers is supporting activists in Ireland who are bringing a case against the government to demand more aggressive action on the climate crisis. “We need to hold governments accountable for the promises they are making,” says Khan. “In our view, it’s unlawful for them to be as deeply negligent as they are.”, All the activists I speak to are passionate about amplifying the voices of BAME people. “A big part of what I do is pushing for voices from the global south to be included in the climate change discussion,” says Doshi. They run workshops on climate colonialism and speak at events for youth leadership., “We need more black, brown and working-class voices to be heard,” agrees Adetero. “They don’t really get the opportunity to have their voices heard that white people do.”, These are challenging times. “I am depressed about things,” says Doshi. “I see Trump pulling out of the Paris accord, the Trans Mountain pipeline in Canada, Bolsonaro taking away indigenous lands in Brazil.” But in spite of everything, there is also hope. “I feel like we have no choice but to be optimistic,” says Ibrahim. “The climate movement is massively growing. We’re reaching new people. The narrative is changing. We have to keep fighting against all odds.”we need to be heard the bame climate activists who wont be ignored", "label": 0}, "train-463": {"text": "\nCarbon emissions fall as electricity producers move away from coal\n, Global emissions down by 2% amid mild winter and reduced use of coal-fired power plants , \nJillian Ambrose and \nSimon Goodley, \n\nMon 9 Mar 2020 02.01 EDT\n\n, Carbon emissions from the global electricity system fell by 2% last year, the biggest drop in almost 30 years, as countries began to turn their backs on coal-fired power plants., A new report on the world’s electricity generation revealed the steepest cut in carbon emissions since 1990 as the US and the EU turned to cleaner energy sources., Overall, power from coal plants fell by 3% last year, even as China’s reliance on coal plants climbed for another year to make up half the world’s coal generation for the first time., Coal generation in the US and Europe has halved since 2007, and last year collapsed by almost a quarter in the EU and by 16% in the US., The report from climate thinktank Ember, formerly Sandbag, warned that the dent in the world’s coal-fired electricity generation relied on many one-off factors, including milder winters across many countries., “Progress is being made on reducing coal generation, but nothing like with the urgency needed to limit climate change,” the report said., Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s, The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.”, Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.”, Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases., A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases., An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”., The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”, A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states., Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions., Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research., Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”., At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”, Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”, The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC., The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray., A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century., The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry., Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president., Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming., Jonathan Watts, Dave Jones, the lead author of the report, said governments must dramatically accelerate the electricity transition so that global coal generation collapses throughout the 2020s., “To switch from coal into gas is just swapping one fossil fuel for another. The cheapest and quickest way to end coal generation is through a rapid rollout of wind and solar,” he said., “But without concerted policymaker efforts to boost wind and solar, we will fail to meet climate targets. China’s growth in coal, and to some extent gas, is alarming but the answers are all there.”, The EU has made the fastest progress towards replacing coal with wind and solar power, while the US has increased its reliance on gas following its shale boom in recent years., The report revealed that renewable wind and solar power rose by 15% in 2019 to make up 8% of the world’s electricity., In the EU, wind and solar power made up almost a fifth of the electricity generated last year, ahead of the US which relied on these renewable sources for 11% of its electricity. In China and India, renewable energy made up 8% and 9% of the electricity system, respectively., To meet the Paris climate goals, the world needs to record a compound growth rate of 15% for wind and solar generation every year – which will require “a colossal effort”, the report warned., The electricity generation report was published as a separate piece of research claimed that 38 out of 75 of the world’s largest asset managers are stalling on taking action on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues., The latest ranking by Asset Owners Disclosure Project, a scheme managed by the investment campaign group ShareAction, found that the 38 asset managers have weak or nonexistent policy commitments and fail to account for their real-world impacts across their mainstream assets., The survey also claimed that the investment managers often lack appropriate engagement and escalation processes on climate change, human rights and biodiversity., Scores were based on a survey of activities in responsible investment governance, climate change, human rights, and biodiversity and ranged between AAA to E. Not a single asset manager was granted an AAA or AA rating, the top two scores available., Felix Nagrawala, ShareAction analyst, said: “While many in the industry are eager to promote their ESG credentials, our analysis clearly indicates that few of the world’s largest asset managers can lay claim to having a truly sustainable approach across all their investments.”, ShareAction said the world’s six largest asset managers – including BlackRock (rated D), State Street (D) and Vanguard (E) – were among the worst performers., Vanguard said it was committed to companies making “appropriate disclosures on governance, strategy and performance on relevant ESG risks”.

We are destined (doomed if you like) to live in a plastic world. For instance it may not be long before all our books, newspapers and wrapping papers will be plastic. In other words paper made from cellulose will be phased out and with it will go most of the need for growing conifers. At the same time we are promised a parallel revolution: the development of artificial meat and this, if it comes off, will vastly reduce the numbers of farm animals., We can imagine the joint impact of these two revolutions on great areas of upland Britain which are the strongholds of conifers, sheep and meat cattle. Deprived of their former usefulness these districts would become playgrounds for the people. Vast conifer plantations would become more like wild forests. Even vaster areas of upland grasslands would be invaded by scrub. Then to complete the wilderness atmosphere we would only have to reintroduce bears, wolves, lynxes, beavers and wild boars.

Weed hangs motionless and nothing stirs the thin sediment coating sunken leaves in the shallows. Every flooded ditch and waterlogged hollow in my area of west Dartmoor is brimming with gelatinous mounds of frogspawn, eyeballing me from the margins as if it has rained full stops. But my pool, dug with nature in mind, has none., I know that creatures dwell in its muddy depths. A pond is a petri dish of potential, an experiment that generates life with the simple addition of water. Yet today, mine is reluctant to give up its secrets. I put it down to the cold., Eventually I spot something darting up from the darkness. It pierces the flat surface membrane in the blink of an eye, a tiny ripple, and is gone. Another follows, quickly taking on air at the tip of its abdomen before battling buoyancy and furiously paddling down out of sight. Shaped like a seed pod, blackish-brown with gold edging and roughly 35mm long, this is one of our most striking water insects: the great diving beetle (Dytiscus marginalis)., A fast and formidable predator, this large beetle hunts any pond dwellers it can grab, whether invertebrates, tadpoles or even small fish. Its carnivorous larvae, armed with sickle-shaped jaws that inject deadly enzymes into prey, are just as fearsome., I manage to scoop out one of the adults with an old rockpooling net for a closer look before returning it unharmed. Well adapted for an aquatic life, they carry oxygen supplies like a scuba diver and swim with feathery rear feet. They are also surprisingly strong fliers, enabling them to colonise new stretches of water, and are widespread in Britain. However, they are not always easy to see, only fleetingly surfacing for air, which they store beneath the rear of their wing cases., At night they are bolder. When I revisit the pond after dark it is transformed.

For one brief and frantic moment, I thought it was a goshawk; but then I caught sight of the mid-brown plumage and narrow white rump, which marked it out as a female or immature hen harrier – known in birding parlance as a “ringtail”., We don’t see many of these beautiful birds on the Somerset Levels; indeed nowadays, you don’t see many of them anywhere. That’s because hen harriers are still being illegally trapped and shot by gamekeepers on Scottish and English moorlands, to stop them killing red grouse., We may disagree about some of the laws on the statute book, but we can’t just choose to ignore them. That’s why I sometimes struggle with the phrase “wildlife crime”; this is, quite simply, a crime.

Less than £2 per person was being spent on forestry, research found., Each of the major parties included substantial tree-planting pledges in their manifestos at last autumn’s general election. However, details from the government on how this will be achieved have been scant., The agriculture bill currently progressing through parliament will put in place a broad legal framework to reward farmers for providing public goods, such as tree planting, but there have been no concrete plans yet from ministers on how much farmers can expect to be paid, when and how such schemes will be managed., There are also increasing questions over the strategy, which has the backing in principle of many environmental groups, but must be worked out in careful detail if new forests are to be sited in the right places so as to preserve existing habitats and not lead to further unintended emissions., Experts told the Guardian this week that commercial forests would provide little gain in the UK’s ability to store carbon. They also said trees planted in the wrong places could increase emissions, for instance, planting trees in some peatland dries out the peat and causes it to release carbon into the air., Other plantations can threaten local birds and wildlife if not carefully managed., Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, called on the government to increase funding for forestry and double tree cover in the UK, which, at 13%, is currently sparsely wooded compared with similar European countries., He said: “Ministers love to talk about planting more trees to fight the climate emergency, but seem unprepared to put their money where their mouth is. We have enough land but not yet the political will.”, He called on the chancellor to act in Wednesday’s budget. “This budget is an opportunity to free up funding to create and maintain woodlands. Nature benefits from more trees, people feel better, and of course trees help combat climate change so there is absolutely no excuse to skimp on this funding.”, The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the final figures on funding for trees were likely to be much higher, as cash would flow from other sources within government beyond the countryside stewardship scheme. For instance, the government made a commitment in its manifesto to spend £640m on a Nature for Climate Fund, which would increase tree planting among other efforts to restore the UK’s natural environment. However, no details of any of these new potential sources of funding have yet been laid out., A spokesperson for Defra said: “Forests and woodlands are vital for capturing carbon, protecting wildlife and improving the environment for the next generation. That’s why our commitment to increase woodland cover as we work towards net zero sits at the heart of our ambitious environmental programme.”more funds needed for new trees in england say campaigners", "label": 0}, "train-468": {"text": "\nScientists warn of 'critical gaps' in Australia's climate science capability\n, Exclusive: Australia needs the expertise to predict changes which have a major impact across the country, a review finds, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nTue 10 Mar 2020 12.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 10 Mar 2020 15.07 EDT\n\n, A government-backed review of Australia’s climate science capability has identified “critical gaps” in the nation’s ability to understand the processes that underpin climate change, with atmospheric modelling lagging other countries., It found Australia was in danger of losing “critical expertise” needed to predict changes in major climate patterns, such as El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole, that have a major impact across the continent., On atmospheric modelling, it found research had fallen “well behind those that lead the world”, partly because of a “lack of computational power and data storage”., The report, seen by Guardian Australia and expected to be released this week, was requested by the government-appointed National Climate Science Advisory Committee to help develop a strategy in the area., It was co-ordinated by the Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes (Clex), and finalised after a workshop and survey of researchers at academic institutions and government agencies., The report focused on research into “climate processes”, which cover issues including the behaviour of clouds and how air moves in the atmosphere, and the dynamics of oceans and ice-covered regions., It concluded the research effort across Australia was substantial, including a “very strong, world-leading effort” in observing the oceans. But while the country had a good foundation of research, coordination was lacking., The survey found there were 466 full-time equivalent staff and students dedicated to investigating climate processes, but there was a “sub-critical mass” of research into aspects of atmospheric physics that were integral to phenomena like heatwaves and the cycle of El Niño and La Nina, a natural cycle that can have major influence on Australian rainfall and heat., The report said: “The loss of expertise in these areas represents a critical threat to Australia’s ability to understand and predict such phenomena into the future. The shortage of expertise in these areas requires urgent correction.”, It said there was also evidence efforts to develop climate models were “approaching critical thresholds of under-resourcing and capacity limits”. While Australia was putting a “significant effort” into understanding the processes of the cryosphere – parts of the planet covered in ice – the efforts were fragmented., In a summary, the report says: “The report concludes that a transformation of climate processes research into a community working collectively towards national goals in a common science framework is essential., “Given the underpinning role of processes research for all other climate research this transformation provides the foundation for providing solutions to the climate-related societal challenges ahead.”, To combat the issues, the report suggested a “community-wide research network” be created, and short-term “accelerator institutes” funded to tackle key knowledge gaps., In 2017, the Australian Academy of Science issued a report into Australia’s climate science capability that also identified risks. It said the team developing Australia’s weather and modelling system – Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (Access) – was a “small fraction of the size of groups building equivalent models for their regions in other countries”., The report was requested by the National Climate Science Advisory Committee, which itself issued a report in June 2019 that was not made publicly available until 19 December 2019., A Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesman said the report was commissioned by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, and the science minister, Karen Andrews, after they received recommendations from the National Climate Science Advisory Committee., He said it would “help ensure the government’s climate science activities are better coordinated and prioritised to maintain and strengthen Australia’s climate research capability”., “The government is committed to climate science investment and is progressing the establishment of an enhanced climate science advisory group that will build on the work of the National Climate Science Advisory Committee to ensure that Australian decision makers have continued access to world class scientific information,” the spokesman said.scientists warn of critical gaps in australias climate science capability", "label": 0}, "train-469": {"text": "\nClimate emergency: global action is ‘way off track’ says UN head\n, Deadly heatwaves, floods and rising hunger far greater threat to world than coronavirus, scientists say, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nTue 10 Mar 2020 12.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 10 Mar 2020 12.38 EDT\n\n, The world is “way off track” in dealing with the climate emergency and time is fast running out, the UN secretary general has said., António Guterres sounded the alarm at the launch of the UN’s assessment of the global climate in 2019. The report concludes it was a record-breaking year for heat, and there was rising hunger, displacement and loss of life owing to extreme temperatures and floods around the world. , Scientists said the threat was greater than that from the coronavirus, and world leaders must not be diverted away from climate action., The climate assessment is led by the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with input from the UN’s agencies for environment, food, health, disasters, migration and refugees, as well as scientific centres., In 2019 the oceans were at the hottest on record, with at least 84% of the seas experiencing one or more marine heatwaves. Surface air temperatures around the world were the hottest ever recorded, after a natural El Niño event boosted figures in 2016., The report says results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate 2018-19 was the 32nd year in a row in which more ice was lost than gained. The melting of land ice combined with thermal expansion of water pushed sea levels up to the highest mark since records began. , The long-term decline of Arctic sea ice also continued in 2019, with the September average extent – usually the lowest of the year – the third worst on record., “Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris agreement calls for,” said Guterres. 2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. “Time is fast running out for us to avert the worst impacts of climate disruption and protect our societies.”, He added: “We need more ambition on emission cuts, adaptation and finance in time for the climate conference, Cop26, in Glasgow, UK, in November. That is the only way to ensure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable future for all people on a healthy planet.”, Prof Brian Hoskins, of Imperial College London, said: “The report is a catalogue of weather in 2019 made more extreme by climate change, and the human misery that went with it. It points to a threat that is greater to our species than any known virus – we must not be diverted from the urgency of tackling it by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible.”, Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s, The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.”, Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.”, Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases., A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases., An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”., The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”, A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states., Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions., Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research., Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”., At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”, Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”, The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC., The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray., A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century., The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry., Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president., Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming., Jonathan Watts, The WMO said its report provided authoritative information for policymakers on the need for climate action and showed the impacts of extreme weather., A heatwave in Europe was made five times more likely by global heating, and the scorching summer led to 20,000 emergency hospital admissions and 1,462 premature deaths in France alone. India and Japan also sweltered and Australia started and ended the year with severe heat and had its driest year on record. Australia had “an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season”, the WMO noted., Floods and storms contributed most to displacing people from their homes, particularly Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and its neighbours, Cyclone Fani in south Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The number of internal displacements from such disasters is estimated to have been close to 22 million people in 2019, up from 17 million in 2018., The US saw heavy rains, with the total from July 2018 to June 2019 being the highest on record. Total economic losses in the US for the year were estimated at $20bn, the WMO said., Unpredictable climate and extreme weather was a factor in 26 of the 33 nations that were hit by food crises in 2019, and was the main driver in 12 of the countries. “After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again – over 820 million suffered from hunger in 2018, the latest global data available,” the report says., The WMO said unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the severe desert locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, which is the worst for decades and expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security., Prof Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, said: “This annual litany of climate change impacts and inadequate global responses makes for a gut-wrenching read.

This is the term used to describe a change from one state to another – for example, the collapse of fisheries in Newfoundland, the death of vegetation in the Sahel, desertification of agricultural lands in Niger, bleaching of coral reefs in Jamaica, and the eutrophication of Lake Erhai in China., They found that bigger and more complex biomes were initially more resilient than small, biologically simpler systems. However, once the former hit a tipping point, they collapse relatively faster because failures repeat throughout their modular structure. As a result, the bigger the ecosystem, the harder it is likely to fall., Based on their statistical analysis, the authors estimate an ecosystem the size of the Amazon (approximately 5.5m km2) could collapse in approximately 50 years once a tipping point had been reached. For a system the size of the Caribbean coral reefs (about 20,000 km2), collapse could occur in 15 years once triggered., The paper concludes: “We must prepare for regime shifts in any natural system to occur over the ‘human’ timescales of years and decades, rather than multigenerational timescales of centuries and millennia., “Humanity now needs to prepare for changes in ecosystems that are faster than we previously envisaged through our traditional linear view of the world, including across Earth’s largest and most iconic ecosystems, and the social-ecological systems that they support.”, The paper says this could be the case in Australia where the recent Australian bushfires followed protracted periods of drought and may indicate a shift to a drier ecosystem., Scientists were already aware that systems tended to decline much faster than they grew but the new study quantifies and explains this trend., “What is new is that we are showing this is part of a wider story. The larger the system, the greater the fragility and the proportionately quicker collapses,” John Dearing, professor in physical geography at the University of Southampton and lead author of the study, said., “What we are saying is don’t be taken in by the longevity of these systems just because they may have been around for thousands, if not millions, of years – they will collapse much more rapidly than we think.”, Dearing said he was concerned that one of the possible implications of the study was that complete destruction of the Amazon could occur within his grandchildren’s lifetimes., “This is a paper that is satisfying from a scientific point of view, but worrying from a personal point of view. You’d rather not come up with such a set of results,” he said., A separate study last week warned the Amazon could shift within the next decade into a source of carbon emissions rather than a sink, because of damage caused by loggers, farmers and global heating., Experts said the new findings should be a spur to action., “I think the combination of theory, modelling and observations is especially persuasive in this paper, and should alert us to risks from human activities that perturb the large and apparently stable ecosystems upon which we depend,” said Georgina Mace, professor of biodiversity and ecosystems at University College London, who was not involved in the studies., “There are effective actions that we can take now, such as protecting the existing forest, managing it to maintain diversity, and reducing the direct pressures from logging, burning, clearance and climate change.”, These views were echoed by Ima Vieira, an ecologist at Museu Emílio Goeldi in Belém, Brazil. “This is a very important paper. For Brazil to avoid the ecosystem collapse modelled in this study, we need to strengthen governance associated to imposing heavy fines on companies with dirty supply chains, divestment strategies targeting key violators and enforcement of existing laws related to environmental crimes. And we have to be quick.”, However, the methodology was not universally accepted. Erika Berenguer, a senior research associate at the University of Oxford and Lancaster University, said the regime shifts paper relied too much on data from lakes and oceans to be useful as an indicator of what would happen to rainforests., “While there is no doubt the Amazon is at great risk and that a tipping point is likely, such inflated claims do not help either science or policy making,” she said., The authors said their study was not a forecast about a specific region but a guide to the speed at which change could occur.ecosystems size of amazon rainforest can collapse within decades", "label": 0}, "train-471": {"text": "\n‘I swapped my gun for binoculars’: India’s hunters turn to conservation\n, \n‘I swapped my gun for binoculars’: India’s hunters turn to conservation\n, Villagers are downing their weapons and protecting swathes of ancient forest and its wildlife in Nagaland state, Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent, \n\nTue 10 Mar 2020 07.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 10 Mar 2020 23.00 EDT\n\n, It is Sunday in Kohima, the capital of Nagaland, and like many Naga, Gwasinlo Thong has spent the morning in church. A tall, elegant man in a crisp navy suit, he hands over a bag of guava from his garden as we sit down to talk. “When I was a child we used to hear tigers roaring in the forest around our village,” he says, over a cup of sweet milky tea. “But even in my lifetime the birds and mammals have disappeared.”, One of the seven states that make up India’s tribal north-east, Nagaland’s mountains form a jagged spine along the Indo-Myanmar border. Home to the Naga, Tibeto-Burman people made up of an estimated 70 tribes, it is part of the Indo-Burma “biodiversity hotspot”, one of 36 such regions identified globally. Ninety-two species of mammal have been documented here, as well as 490 species of butterfly, 500 species of bird and 360 species of orchid. But Thong, a local conservationist, isn’t the first person to bemoan the disappearance of wildlife., While the Naga have always had famously omnivorous tastes (“We Naga eat anything that moves, apart from humans!” jokes Thong), historically their animist beliefs meant killing was not taken lightly. “There was a real affinity with nature – the concept of exploitation of wildlife was absent,” says Bano Haralu, the director of the Nagaland Wildlife and Biodiversity Conservation Trust. “People hunted with spears and traps, and nobody hunted for commercial purposes.”, The turning point came about 30 years ago when a perfect storm of guns, unemployment and cultural shifts led to a dramatic loss of biodiversity. Key to this was the Naga’s decades-long struggle for independence from India, a conflict that has cost an estimated 200,000 Naga lives., “Insurgency brought guns into the region, which were then used for hunting,” says Haralu. As young Naga moved to towns in search of work, their relationship with nature was severed. “With no jobs, they began to look to the forests for a quick buck instead – only now they were using guns rather than spears and traps. I’ve met people who’ve killed 80 hornbills in one expedition,” she laments., At the same time bushmeat – traditionally shared out with clan and family members – became something to make money from. One Sumi Naga hunter says he recently sold a Sambar deer at the market in Kohima for 30,000 rupees, about £300. That is more than many Naga earn in six months., Chinese medicine has also played a part. As demand increased in the 80s, Naga began selling everything from tiger bones and bear bile to wild ginseng, geckos and cordyceps. With Indian and Burmese middlemen buying pangolin scales for 8,000 rupees a kilo, the animal’s numbers plummeted., In 1998, after noticing a catastrophic drop in wildlife, Khonoma, an Angami Naga village just south of Kohima, set aside 25 sq km of forest as a community conservation area, banning all hunting and logging within its borders. Soon other communities began to follow suit., One of these is Yaongyimchen, a Phom Naga village perched high in the mist-wreathed mountains of eastern Nagaland. In 2010 the villagers established the Yaongyimchen Community Biodiversity Conserved Area, setting aside 10 sq km of forest as a refuge for wildlife., Their biggest success is the Amur falcon, a small, resilient raptor that undertakes a mammoth 14,000-mile round trip each year between its breeding grounds in north-eastern Asia to where they winter in southern Africa. They pause at sites across Nagaland to feast on flying termites and rest before crossing the Arabian Sea., In early November, at the peak of the autumn migration, the skies above Yaongyimchen are stippled black with birds. Nuklu Phom, an intense, godly man at the helm of the local conservation efforts, says the falcon’s numbers have increased tenfold since the hunting ban of 2010. “Around 50,000 used to roost here each spring and autumn,” he said. “But now we have at least half a million. They know it’s safe here.”, Yimti, a 35-year-old Phom Naga, used to shoot around 700 falcons over the course of each migration, selling them for the equivalent of £1 each in the local market. Now he earns £3 a day as a labourer. Given the financial temptations, I asked Nuklu how he stopped people hunting. “We explained that the falcons were God’s creation, like humans. And that farmers in southern Africa were waiting for them, and would suffer if they didn’t arrive. With the help of the village elders, people listened.” Now anyone caught hunting has their gun confiscated and is fined 25,000 rupees., The hunting ban has also benefited other fauna, and the area is a safe haven for bears, leopards, 85 species of bird, 15 species of frog, and – Nuklu thinks – a lone tiger, an animal thought to be extinct in these hills., As many as a third of Nagaland’s villages now have conservation areas, all of them initiated and managed at grassroots level. Churches have organised gun amnesties. Bushmeat is no longer openly on sale. All over the state villagers have donated land to community conservancies. While young men with guns and catapults are still a common sight across the state, the tide is turning., As wildlife slowly returns to these areas, villagers are seeing that their actions matter, that real change can happen when communities work together., “I used to take my gun and catapult to the jungle,” says Ivito, a 47-year-old Sumi Naga from the Tizu Valley Biodiversity Conservation and Livelihood Network in central Nagaland. “Now I’ve sold my gun to pay for my children’s education, and I patrol with my binoculars instead.”, Ivito, like many others, hopes eco-tourism will replace the income he used to make from hunting, but so far only a handful of tourists have braved the bad roads. For those who do make the effort, however, the rewards are huge., • Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent’s report on Nagaland for Costing the Earth will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 10 March at 15.30 and Wednesday 11 March at 21.00. , Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresi swapped my gun for binoculars indias hunters turn to conservation aoe", "label": 0}, "train-472": {"text": "\nTrees on commercial UK plantations 'not helping climate crisis'\n, Exclusive: carbon from most harvested wood soon ends up back in atmosphere, says study, \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nTue 10 Mar 2020 06.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 10 Mar 2020 15.05 EDT\n\n, Commercial tree plantations in Britain do not store carbon to help the climate crisis because more than half of the harvested timber is used for less than 15 years and a quarter is burned, according to a new report., While fast-growing non-native conifers can sequester carbon more quickly than slow-growing broadleaved trees, that carbon is released again if the trees are harvested and the wood is burned or used in products with short lifespans, such as packaging, pallets and fencing., Of the UK’s 2018 timber harvest, 23% was used for wood fuel, while 56% was taken to sawmills. Only 33% of the wood used by sawmills was for construction, where wood used in permanent buildings can lock in carbon for decades. Much of sawmill wood was used for fencing (36%) with a service life of 15 years, or packaging and pallets (24%) or paper (4%)., “There is no point growing a lot of fast-growing conifers with the logic that they sequester carbon quickly if they then go into a paper mill because all that carbon will be lost to the atmosphere within a few years,” said Thomas Lancaster, head of UK land policy at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which commissioned the report. “We should not be justifying non-native forestry on carbon grounds if it’s not being used as a long-term carbon store.”, The Committee on Climate Change has called for 1.5 billion new trees by 2050 – requiring planting on 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of land a year, increasing Britain’s forest cover from 13% to 19%., Many of these new forests will also provide a commercial timber crop. But the scientific review by the ecologist Ellie Crane of how forestry can best address the climate and biodiversity crisis finds that there is no simple solution in Britain., The best place for non-native conifers to quickly sequester carbon is on intensively farmed lowland but this high-quality agricultural land is too expensive for forestry to make financial sense for landowners., Planting conifers on the cheapest land such as the blanket bogs of Scotland’s Flow Country is “disastrous” for biodiversity, according to Lancaster, but also leads to carbon emissions because the bogs are drained for forestry and the peat degrades, releasing carbon into the atmosphere., This leaves “shallow peat” moorlands of western Scotland, south and mid-Wales and parts of the Lake District and the Pennines as the most likely locations for new carbon-sequestering forests. Here, the RSPB has concerns about the impact on wildlife. Rare and declining species such as the curlew that breed on open moorland cannot survive close to plantations, which become home to predators of their chicks such as crows., While the best option for wildlife and slower but long-term carbon sequestration is to plant broadleaved woodlands in the right locations and leave them intact, if Britain does not produce its own timber it will import more – in effect exporting its carbon footprint overseas., “It’s clearly not just a question of more trees equals a safer climate. Trees in the wrong place could exacerbate climate change and biodiversity decline,” said Lancaster. “There’s also a big question around the capacity of Natural England and regulatory bodies in Scotland and Wales and the forestry commissions to properly assess what impact any planting schemes will have on nature, both good and bad, and on the climate., “If we’re serious about tackling the climate and ecological emergency there needs to be a huge government investment in capacity to get that right, otherwise we’re going to have lots of inappropriate planting which could be negative for the climate as well as biodiversity.”uk commercial tree plantations ineffective climate crisis report", "label": 0}, "train-473": {"text": "\nWhy cycling in Palestine is an intensely political act\n, Riding is way of thumbing the nose at occupation and connecting with the land , \nCarlton Reid, \n\nTue 10 Mar 2020 03.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 10 Mar 2020 03.04 EDT\n\n, Are you annoyed by the anti-motorcycle barriers or speed bumps on your local bike path? Spare a thought for Palestinian bicycle advocates. According to the UN, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank imposes 705 obstacles to the free movement of Palestinians., These obstacles include military checkpoints where only those with permits can pass, a 440-mile separation barrier, and roving patrols that can turn a joyous bike ride into humiliating roadside detention., For Palestinian paramedic Sohaib Samara and other cyclists in the region, pedalling is not just about fresh air and exercise; it’s intensely, unavoidably political., On one ride when he and a friend were pulled over by an Israeli army patrol, Samara says he heard the soldiers asking, in Hebrew, whether they should shoot the pair in the arms., “I was not afraid for myself because at the end of the day, if I’m gonna die, I’m gonna die,” said Samara. “But I was worried that if I tried to defend myself or even argue that the soldiers had no right to stop us, they might later blow up my family’s house.”, “Your brain starts to wander in dark places when, really, you just want to keep cycling,” he added., Riding around the West Bank is a way of thumbing the nose at occupation, but it is also a way of connecting with the land; bicycling as a form of affirmative action., In 2016, Samara launched Ramallah Riders, a Facebook group for would-be cyclists in the West Bank town of Ramallah, six miles north of Jerusalem. Four years later, the group now has 3,000 members and, in recognition of wider West Bank membership, is today known as Cycling Palestine., When I lived in Jerusalem for six months in 1984 – having ridden to Israel on my Claud Butler Majestic touring bike – I used to ride out to West Bank villages on weekends with an Israeli friend. We were welcomed with handshakes and mint tea. We were exotic, but we were on bicycles, a form of locomotion that identified us as harmless idiots to Palestinians and Israelis alike., Israel has since had something of a bicycling boom. Along with amenities such as a billionaire-backed velodrome, it also now has protected cycleways, and the Giro d’Italia pro-cycling race spent three days in the country in 2018. But despite the best efforts of Cycling Palestine, the West Bank remains a bicycling backwater., “You’re an old man now,” the then 30-year-old Samara was told by family and friends, worried about his love of cycling. “You should be working, starting a family,” they told him. “Cycling is stupid.”, Ignoring the barbs, Samara continued to cycle., “We’ve been doing this for over four years now; people have lost hope in us,” joked Malak Hasan, Cycling Palestine’s co-organiser. “They’re now more accepting.”, I was speaking to Samara and Hasan in the foyer of the Manger Square Hotel in Bethlehem after an e-bike tour of the city, a new weekly organised ride which had taken me past highlights such as Banksy’s Walled Off Hotel, a greater draw for some than the town’s Church of the Nativity., The e-bike tour aims to get tourists out of buses to see the “real” Bethlehem., “Bicycling in Palestine is a tool for change,” said Hasan. “Environmentally, it’s good; socially, it’s amazing. It’s the best icebreaker — whenever we are on the road, someone wants to talk to us, find out who we are.”, Cycling Palestine’s weekly rides are for locals and leisure but, according to Hasan, “lots of people have adopted cycling as a lifestyle; they now go to work on bikes.”, This isn’t always easy in the West Bank. It’s hilly, it’s hot for much of the year, and cycling is still considered an odd thing to do, especially for women., “Because I’m visibly Muslim,” said the hijab-wearing Hasan, “people are always throwing comments in my face such as ‘how could you be a good Muslim showcasing yourself like this?’”, The cultural stigma – a barrier to bicycling – is lower for men. “Men can embark on amazing adventures because no one will be asking where this man is sleeping. Where is he going? Is he alone?”, After a four-day, 300-mile group ride in 2017 from the Qalandiya refugee camp near Ramallah to Jordan’s Aqaba, Hasan returned to stinging rebukes. She was one of only two women on the 11-person trip., “Most of the comments were like, ‘how could you sleep in tents and on deserted roads with nine men?’ The expectation is for a woman to be at home, taking care of babies, being decent and modest.”, Hasan’s husband doesn’t cycle, “but,” she stated proudly, “he’s very supportive”., She learned to love cycling when studying for a master’s degree in communication in Swansea., “I would feel so overwhelmed with studying, and then get on the bike and feel very relaxed. When I came back to Palestine, I wanted to go back to biking, but I was terrified of people attacking me. I stopped biking until I found Sohaib. We went on a bike ride, and have never stopped cycling. It’s amazing.”, Amazing, but restricted. “Between each valley and the next, there’s an illegal Israeli settlement,” said Hasan. “If you want to cycle for 50km you will be faced with at least two checkpoints and a settlement, maybe a surveillance tower, patrols; continuity is always broken.”, One of Cycling Palestine’s recent tours was a multi-day, 70-person tour following the full length of the separation barrier: their own form of rolling resistance., “It is our duty to keep our relationship with this land,” said Samara. “If we stop moving around, the occupiers will steal more of it.”why cycling in palestine is an intensely political act", "label": 0}, "train-474": {"text": "\nUK's lost sea meadows to be resurrected in climate fight\n, \nUK's lost sea meadows to be resurrected in climate fight\n, First seagrass restoration in Britain will capture carbon rapidly and offer habitat for lost marine life, \nDamian Carrington in Dale Bay, Pembrokeshire, \n\nTue 10 Mar 2020 02.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 10 Mar 2020 06.35 EDT\n\n, “We think this whole bay was once carpeted with seagrass,” says Evie Furness, waving across the sparkling, sunlit waters of Dale Bay in Pembrokeshire, Wales., The underwater meadow is long gone though, a victim of past pollution and shipping. So from a boat half a mile from shore, Furness is feeding a long rope into the water, which carries a little hessian bag of seagrass seeds every metre. “We’ve passed the 800,000 seed mark now,” she says., The Seagrass Ocean Rescue project will ultimately place 20km of rope and a million seeds on the shallow seafloor, where they will sprout through the bags and restore the habitat., Seagrass meadows were once common around the UK coast, but more than 90% have been lost as a result of algae-boosting pollution, anchor damage and port and marina building. The meadows, however, store carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests and harbour up to 40 times more marine life than seabeds without grass, facts that are driving the effort to bring them back., “We face a growing climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency, and we have to make rapid steps to fight those,” says Richard Unsworth at Swansea University and lead biologist on the £400,000 project, which is supported by WWF and Sky Ocean Rescue., Seagrass covers just 0.2% of the ocean but provides an estimated 10% of its carbon storage. It is in trouble around the world, and Unsworth hopes the first project of its kind in the UK may help boost take-up of this nature-based solution to the climate crisis., Seagrass can grow up to 1 metre long. Its flowers are pollinated by shrimps and other creatures, as well as water currents. The seeds are like small pine nuts and many have been placed in their growbags by volunteer schoolchildren. The first green shoots should appear by October., The huge past losses of seagrass means allowing nature to recolonise the bay in its own time is not an option. “It’s hard for people to understand how screwed the ocean is. It’s out of sight and out of mind,” says Unsworth. “The environment here has got stuck in an anoxic, algae-rich, muddy state. You have to intervene.”, The project is the culmination of eight years of laboratory and sea trials and extensive discussions with the local community. “This is perfect habitat, really sheltered, and it’s all coming together here,” he says., The seeds were collected over 300 hours of diving at the few remaining seagrass meadows at theLlŷn peninsula in north Wales and on the coasts of Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. “It’s like underwater blackberry picking,” says Unsworth, describing plucking the “spades” that contain the seeds. The seeds harvested at Llŷn were about 0.05% of the total, so the meadow there was not damaged., Seagrass has a high turnover of leaves and the dead ones fall into oxygen-poor sediments below where they trap carbon. The meadows also slow currents, allowing other organic material to drift down and be trapped, potentially for thousands of years., The meadows are also a rich habitat, providing shelter and food for juvenile cod, plaice and other species. The 20,000 square metres being restored in Dale Bay could also support cuttlefish, pipefish and seahorses, and 200 million invertebrates such as the snakelocks anemone, stalked jellyfish and colourful snails., Seagrass meadows around the world also provide nurseries for a fifth of the world’s biggest fishing species, including pollock, herring and whiting, meaning their restoration can improve catches., Unsworth says the process of gathering seeds and planting them could be made less expensive in future with mechanisation. A large restoration project in Chesapeake Bay in the US used underwater equipment akin to combine harvesters to collect seeds and where the currents were favourable, they were able to simply scatter the seeds., UK waters are cleaner now following EU water directives in recent decades, Unsworth says: “We want thousands of hectares of seagrass restored and the opportunity exists in this country now. The Stour, Orwell and Humber estuaries, for example. These places are ripe for it.” Next in the team’s sights are locations in North Wales, if funding can be obtained., Seagrass can store about half a tonne of carbon per hectare per year, and more when it is mature,” he says. “It could be part of nature-based solutions to climate change, and a significant part of it.”, Alec Taylor, WWF’s head of marine policy says: “Seagrass restoration ticks so many boxes: climate, fisheries, water quality, biodiversity. But we will only get the benefits if we act now and at scale.”, We want the oceans to play a hero’s role” in the fight against global heating, he says. “And we want the UK government to play a hero’s role too.” The UK hosts a crucial UN climate summit in November., One government action would be to make it easier to get permits for restoration. “Officials say it’s a wonderful idea, but when you apply for licensing you are treated as the criminal until you are proven innocent,” says Unsworth. “It’s almost like we are a problem, rather than a solution”, Looking across Dale Bay, Unsworth concludes: “As a scientist, and as a father, I could spend the next 20 years writing awesome academic papers about seagrass decline, or spend the 20 years doing something about it. We have a responsibility as scientists to act, as well as report.”uk lost sea meadows to be resurrected in climate emergency fight", "label": 0}, "train-475": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a singing in the trees\n, Pulborough Brooks, West Sussex: Woodlarks this winter have been heard singing in places away from their normal breeding grounds , \nRob Yarham, \n\nTue 10 Mar 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 10 Mar 2020 07.15 EDT\n\n, The trees on the hill are shaking in the wind. From the top of one of them, somewhere, a woodlark persists with its pretty, lilting song. I look for it, but it must be hidden by branches. About a dozen woodlarks have spent the winter finding food in the field below the visitor centre – along with the finches and buntings – but I expected them to have made their way back to their normal breeding territories on the nearby heathland by now. But here it is, on the edge of the mixed grassland and hedgerow part of the reserve. There have been other local reports of woodlarks singing – unusually – on farmland in recent days, so it will be interesting to see if there is any expansion from heathland to new breeding sites this spring., A chiffchaff chirrups merrily from some bushes lining the track. I wander down to a hide that overlooks the flooded brooks. The tops of fences emerge from the water, the wind whipping it into white waves that flow towards the hide. Birds are hard to find – the ducks and geese are sheltering far away, on the narrow shorelines and on top of the tall flood banks that line the river. High up, the dark arrow of a peregrine falcon flies over, possibly also searching the valley for birds., Round by the northern side of the brooks, where the raised ground and trees provide some shelter, there are more ducks and geese, swimming on the open water and resting in the distant fields. Among them is a group of gleaming white gulls, the adults growing their summer plumage – including two Mediterranean gulls, Larus melanocephalus, whose large, jet-black heads and bright red bills make them stand out among the slightly smaller black-headed gulls., Some Mediterranean gulls overwinter, mostly by the sea, but food – or weather – does bring them further inland. L melanocephalus began breeding in Britain in 1968, regularly since 1979, and numbers of nesting pairs have risen steadily in Sussex, as elsewhere along the coastlines of southern and eastern England and north-western Europe, since 2000. From now on, they’ll become more common at their colonies on the coast as they start to return for the breeding season.country diary a singing in the trees", "label": 0}, "train-476": {"text": "\nAfrican swine fever destroying small pig farms, as factory farming booms – report\n, China is worst hit as lack of financial support leaves small-scale farms struggling to survive while big companies continue to expand, \nMichael Standaert, \n\nWed 11 Mar 2020 13.23 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 11 Mar 2020 13.28 EDT\n\n, Small farmers across the globe are losing out in the aftermath of the African swine fever (ASF) outbreak that killed a quarter of the world’s pig population, argues a new report., Nowhere is this more evident than China, where swine fever has hit the country’s nearly 40 million small-scale pig farmers hardest, says the report by non-profit organisation Grain., China’s long tradition of small-scale pig farming seems to be coming to an end because of a lack of government support to compensate for culled or diseased pigs, to pay for veterinary costs or chemicals for limiting the spread of ASF, and other biosecurity measures in existing facilities, according to Grain., “Unfortunately, small farmers are getting almost no support, from what we can see,” said Devlin Kuyek, lead author of the report., After the first notification of the ASF outbreak in China in August 2018, the illness spread rapidly throughout the industry and led to the slaughter of millions of pigs within months., Just a year later, however, the startling rise in pork prices meant that, despite their losses, many of the biggest industrial pig producers were achieving record profits., Grain has been unable to determine exactly how many of the ASF outbreaks originated in large factory farms or within contract farming production chains that feed the bigger facilities, because of a lack of information or official figures from authorities., In a MARA survey of 1,500 Chinese pig farms in mid-2019, 55% said they had abandoned plans to raise pigs after culling due to future risk of disease, while 22% were waiting to see if the situation cleared up. Only 18% had definite plans to continue pig farming., In the 1990s, small backyard farms supplied around 80% of China’s pork needs. But this has changed rapidly over the past two decades, as the government has steadily industrialised the sector. By 2018, the share of pig farms with more than 500 pigs was around 80%, state-run media reported in November. The government is aiming for at least 65% of pork from industrial farming operations by 2025., As the government’s focus has shifted towards supporting larger-scale production, smaller operations continue to be squeezed into contract farming operations for larger companies., “It is the combination of these two changes that has created the conditions for the rise of new epidemics like ASF and others in Asia’s pork sector,” Kuyek told the Guardian. Despite the fact that it is supposed to be safer, the huge scale of the industrial pig farming industry has propelled the crisis to a global scale, argues the Grain report. “In our view, this is what explains the scale of the recent outbreak. It would not have taken on such massive proportions if it had not penetrated into the global, industrial pork system.” China is not the only country where small farmers have been particularly adversely affected. In mountainous northern Vietnam, the virus has had a disastrous impact on indigenous women who use leftover mash from rice-wine processing to feed pigs they raise to pay bills and school fees., Aaron Kingsbury, an assistant professor of Arts and Sciences at Maine Maritime Academy, who was conducting research in the region at the time of the outbreak in Vietnam, witnessed the devastating effects on these small farmers., “Typically, what you get here is an ethnic minority woman who is raising one or two pigs for family consumption or possibly the wet markets,” Kingsbury said. “Something that provides the family with direct income they otherwise would not have.”, “When one operation gets swine fever and culling begins, the industrial producers are much more capable of tapping into government subsidies for losses of pigs than these small producers, sometimes illiterate women who may not speak Vietnamese and are isolated in small communities,” he said. “When these small producers lose a pig, they really lose quite a bit.”, The report argues that global meat producers are “using the pandemic that they helped to propagate as a political weapon to consolidate their dominance”. , But Brett Stuart, co-founder of Global AgriTrends, an agriculture consulting firm based in the US, disagrees. “I’m not sure that ASF can be shown as a tool of the big companies,” he said. “The incredible profits now are fuelling small farmer margins as well as large.”, Stuart said: “The problem is that complicated diseases like ASF ultimately benefit those with enough scale to pay on-farm vets and implement feed milling procedures, that help protect herds. So while small farmers face a much more uncertain future, that is not enough evidence in my opinion to indict large farmers.”, Andriy Rozstalnyy, an ASF expert and animal health expert at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said the organisation was gathering information to enable a full understanding of ASF transmission., “We cannot speculate on the role of each production sector in ASF spread or endemicity, because the production systems and value chains are very long and complicated in south-east Asia and in particular in China,” Rozstalnyy said., “The fragmented and incomplete data does not fully explain the real epidemiological situation in south-east Asia. FAO is working to collect and analyse data to better understand ASF transmission including the role of feed, fomites, pork products in production systems with different biosecurity practices. This understanding is used to assist countries in development of technically sound and feasible control strategies.”, Rozstalnyy said early detection and containment of ASF outbreaks challenges both small and large-scale operators and both sectors need to be vigilant about any risky practices and aware of establishing more bio-secure practices., “It doesn’t matter if it is a small-scale backyard farmer or workers at a large scale commercial farm, feed supplier, butcher, hunter or international traveller. They all need to strictly follow rules and regulations defined by governments to address risks related to ASF.”african swine fever destroying small pig farms as factory farming booms report", "label": 0}, "train-477": {"text": "\nPolar ice caps melting six times faster than in 1990s\n, \nPolar ice caps melting six times faster than in 1990s\n, Losses of ice from Greenland and Antarctica are tracking the worst-case climate scenario, scientists warn, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nWed 11 Mar 2020 12.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 11 Mar 2020 20.10 EDT\n\n, The polar ice caps are melting six times faster than in the 1990s, according to the most complete analysis to date., The ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica is tracking the worst-case climate warming scenario set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists say. Without rapid cuts to carbon emissions the analysis indicates there could be a rise in sea levels that would leave 400 million people exposed to coastal flooding each year by the end of the century., Rising sea levels are the one of the most damaging long-term impacts of the climate crisis, and the contribution of Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating. The new analysis updates and combines recent studies of the ice masses and predicts that 2019 will prove to have been a record-breaking year when the most recent data is processed., The previous peak year for Greenland and Antarctic ice melting was 2010, after a natural climate cycle led to a run of very hot summers. But the Arctic heatwave of 2019 means it is nearly certain that more ice was lost last year., The average annual loss of ice from Greenland and Antarctica in the 2010s was 475bn tonnes – six times greater than the 81bn tonnes a year lost in the 1990s. In total the two ice caps lost 6.4tn tonnes of ice from 1992 to 2017, with melting in Greenland responsible for 60% of that figure., The IPCC’s most recent mid-range prediction for global sea level rise in 2100 is 53cm. But the new analysis suggests that if current trends continue the oceans will rise by an additional 17cm., “Every centimetre of sea level rise leads to coastal flooding and coastal erosion, disrupting people’s lives around the planet,” said Prof Andrew Shepherd, of the University of Leeds. He said the extra 17cm would mean the number of exposed to coastal flooding each year rising from 360 million to 400 million. “These are not unlikely events with small impacts,” he said. “They are already under way and will be devastating for coastal communities.”, Erik Ivins, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in California, who led the assessment with Shepherd, said the lost ice was a clear sign of global heating. “The satellite measurements provide prima facie, rather irrefutable, evidence,” he said., Almost all the ice loss from Antarctica and half of that from Greenland arose from warming oceans melting the glaciers that flow from the ice caps. This causes glacial flow to speed up, dumping more icebergs into the ocean. The remainder of Greenland’s ice losses are caused by hotter air temperatures that melt the surface of the ice sheet., The combined analysis was carried out by a team of 89 scientists from 50 international organisations, who combined the findings of 26 ice surveys. It included data from 11 satellite missions that tracked the ice sheets’ changing volume, speed of flow and mass., About a third of the total sea level rise now comes from Greenland and Antarctic ice loss. Just under half comes from the thermal expansion of warming ocean water and a fifth from other smaller glaciers. But the latter sources are not accelerating, unlike in Greenland and Antarctica., Shepherd said the ice caps had been slow to respond to human-caused global heating. Greenland and especially Antarctica were quite stable at the start of the 1990s despite decades of a warming climate., Shepherd said it took about 30 years for the ice caps to react. Now that they had a further 30 years of melting was inevitable, even if emissions were halted today. Nonetheless, he said, urgent carbon emissions cuts were vital. “We can offset some of that sea level rise if we stop heating the planet.”, The IPCC is in the process of producing a new global climate report and its lead author, Prof Guðfinna Aðalgeirsdóttir, of the University of Iceland, said: “The reconciled estimate of Greenland and Antarctic ice loss is timely.”, She said she also saw increased losses from Iceland’s ice caps last year. “Summer 2019 was very warm in this region.”polar ice caps melting six times faster than in 1990s", "label": 0}, "train-478": {"text": "Critically endangered snapping turtle program breeds hope for survival, Ninety per cent of Bellinger River snapping turtle adult population was wiped out but Australia’s Taronga Zoo is breeding numbers back up, The Bellinger River snapping turtle is one of the rarest turtles on the planet after a virus wiped out more than 90% of the adult population in 2015, but a captive breeding program is bringing hope that a healthy population can be restored in the wild., Thirty-five turtles have hatched at the special breeding facility at Taronga Zoo since the beginning of this year., The turtles are being housed in a nursery facility where they are fed and keepers monitor their health and growth. , “We release as many back into the wild as possible but some will stay in the breeding program,” said Adam Skidmore, Taronga Zoo’s senior reptile keeper., “In the river there are still some smaller ones growing up but they don’t start breeding until the age of 11 or 12, so, until that happens, we breed here so we can supplement the population., “Hopefully one day they can self-sustain.

A further 20 have been released into the wild in the upper Bellinger River in the mid north coast region of New South Wales., The animals have tracking devices and are monitored by scientists working for the state government’s Saving our Species program., A cure has not yet been found for the virus, known as the Bellinger River virus, that wiped so many of the animals out in 2015., But Gerry McGilvray, a project officer on the program, said the survival rate for the released turtles so far was high., Of the 20 animals, 17 are still being actively tracked. One turtle has died, but not as a result of the virus, while the tracking devices on two others have failed and their whereabouts is uncertain., During the warmer months, scientists recapture the released turtles to check their health, growth and shell measurements, and swab for the virus., In the most recent check-up a week ago, 16 of the turtles were captured and tested and rereleased., “The animals captured a week ago appear to be in good health and there’s no evidence of exposure to the virus,” McGilvray said., The disastrous bushfire season, which has been followed by heavy rainfall, has raised concern that sediment washing into waterways would affect the turtle’s habitat and food sources., McGilvray said scientists were monitoring water quality due to sediment runoff but the effects of this would become clearer over time. So far, the animals they were monitoring remained in good health., “It’s just amazing to see what little animals can do,” she said., “They’re almost two years old when they’re released.

The lid lifted, taking the roof off their world, and the heap’s denizens scattered to find shelter from the downpour of daylight. Ordinarily, there would be, around the rim, a writhing wreath of brandling worms, so knotted together that it would take several seconds before each extricated itself and dripped down the sides of the bin towards safety. The first odd thing I noticed that day was that there were none. The second thing was the shrew., I didn’t immediately recognise it as such, for it was so fleet of invisible foot, just a body racing round and round the top of the heap in erratic loops. While my brain was running through the list of possibilities to identify it – wood mouse, bank vole, many times too small for a rat – my eyes were chasing the dark grey, mole-velvet fur and the long, pointed snout of a shrew.

Community groups are calling for urgent action to save the once abundant habitat, Kate Evans, \n\nWed 11 Mar 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 26 Mar 2020 07.34 EDT\n\n, Tiritiri Matangi is one of the jewels of New Zealand’s Hauraki Gulf. For the past 35 years the island, which is within sight of Auckland’s skyscrapers, has been a protected nature reserve., Step ashore and you’re enveloped in birdsong: kiwi and takahē thrive here, and vegetation envelops the cliffs to the sea. But beneath the waves it’s a different story., “It was solid kelp forest, beautiful ecklonia, crayfish bristling out of every crevice,” marine biologist Roger Grace, who started diving here in the early 1960s, told me shortly before he died last year., Now, the kelp and the crays are almost gone. The bare rock is overgrazed by sea urchins, or kina, which flourish in the absence of snapper and crayfish, their natural predators. The entire seascape is an impoverished and degraded landscape., “People just don’t realise what’s happened before their eyes, because it’s out of sight,” Grace had said. “Unless there are some radical changes, it’s not going to get better.”, In 2000, New Zealand established its first national park of the sea, the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park. Covering 13,900 sq km (5,370 sq mile), the park’s objective was to protect the gulf’s “life-supporting capacity”, its nature and its history. The legislation required the slew of local councils and government departments with jurisdiction over the gulf to consider these objectives in planning or fisheries decisions., However, with the exception of a handful of tiny marine reserves, commercial and recreational fishing was allowed to continue throughout the entire gulf. Twenty years later, the creation of the park has failed to prevent ecosystem collapse., Last week the government body charged with administering the park, the Hauraki Gulf Forum, released a report highlighting what had changed over those two decades., “It certainly hasn’t lived up to the vision we all had, which was a thriving and healthy Hauraki Marine Park,” says Nicola MacDonald, the Māori co-chair of the forum. “Our taonga treasure is dying.”, It remains legal to drag dredges and trawls across the sea floor, even recreationally, and no-take marine reserves have increased just 0.05% in two decades, to 0.3% of the Hauraki park. Crayfish are functionally extinct in most of the gulf: the few that are left play no meaningful role in the ecosystem, for example in keeping urchin numbers down. Kina barrens – those forests of sea urchins – are proliferating. , In 2019, after dramatic declines in the commercial crayfish take, the government slashed the daily recreational quota from six crayfish to three. Most divers are lucky to even find one. The snapper population is down to about 20% of what scientists calculate pre-fishing numbers would have been. Lifelong fishermen report the virtual disappearance of baitfish such as anchovies and pilchards., In 2000, 4% of the seabird species in the gulf were threatened with extinction. Today, 22% are. Spotted shags, which once flourished in their tens of thousands, are down to 300 pairs; scientists suspect a lack of food., On Auckland’s beaches, stormwater and sewage overflows make 38% of the 50 monitored sites frequently unsafe to swim. Three sites are never safe to swim., The dairy industry is another disruptive factor. The nearby Hauraki Plains are New Zealand’s dairy heartland, and despite efforts by farmers to fence off waterways and plant trees, the rivers still pump fertiliser and effluent – and 3,730 tonnes of nitrogen – into the gulf each year. High nitrate levels lead to algal blooms and ocean acidification. Some estuaries are badly affected by sediment flows., Human settlements are growing, too – faster around the gulf than anywhere else in New Zealand. Land clearing has caused sediment to collect elbow-deep in some estuaries, choking delicate organisms., Critics say this is all the more upsetting given New Zealand’s past role as a marine-protection trailblazer. The country is unlikely to meet its commitment under the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) to conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas by this year, let alone contribute to the global push to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030., The minister for conservation, Eugenie Sage, admits the government won’t meet the SDG target this year. “Overseas, we’ve seen visionary initiatives by some of our Pacific neighbours – Palau, the Cook Islands – to extend marine protected areas,” Sage says. “We are a long way back, and that’s really disappointing.”, “We had the first no-take marine reserves in the world. What happened to that leadership position?” says James Frankham, the publisher of New Zealand Geographic magazine. “We’re 20 years on from our landmark national park of the sea, and it’s crashing.”, Frankham, 45, grew up sailing, fishing and diving in the gulf, watching the water roil as seabirds plunged among kahawai and kingfish., Last week he came away fuming from an event run jointly by the department of conservation and Auckland council, commemorating the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park’s 20th anniversary. “I don’t come to outrage very easily as a person, but I was outraged by the lack of political action being planned to address the issue., “I’ve seen incredible change over my lifetime in the Hauraki Gulf, and my father and grandfather had stories of an abundance of biodiversity that were equally preposterous to me as the stories I’m telling my children today. It’s really heartbreaking. I can’t describe it as anything other than a collapse.”, Simon Thrush, head of the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Auckland, says the decline in animal populations is extremely concerning, although there is still time to turn things around., If we could have taken an aspirin 20 years ago, we're on to chemotherapy now, “You can think of these collapses in biodiversity as a series of ratchets.

We can still stop it falling off the next step.”, He argued for immediate action on every problem at once: more marine reserves, a halt to trawling and dredging, and more efforts by developers and farmers to keep sediment out of the gulf. Although more research is necessary, too, he called for action on the studies already done: for example, his research in the 1990s demonstrated the negative biodiversity effects of bottom-impacting fishing gear, but fisheries management has not adapted to the problem., “We need agencies to not just commission another report and have another meeting, but to do something,” he says. “We need citizens to vote appropriately. We want as many people as we can to stick their thumb in the dike.”, There have been some positive developments. A voluntary speed limit for container ships of 10 knots has effectively eliminated whale collisions. The creation of the island sanctuaries, such as Tiritiri Matangi, appears to have reduced mammalian pests. Commercial longline fishers are collaborating with NGOs and the government to reduce seabird by-catch, including trialling a device to bait lines underwater so birds don’t get caught in them. Community and local Māori groups are reintroducing native species to the islands, removing old moorings from bays and seeding juvenile mussels, which act as natural water purifiers., Auckland council, meanwhile, admits many building sites haven’t complied with sediment control regulations and is trialling new ways to enforce them. Stricter rules for farmers aimed at curbing run-off will come into force this year., In 2016, a report titled SeaChange – a collective effort from a diverse group of gulf users, including commercial and recreational fishers, Māori and conservationists – made ambitious recommendations to address these issues. This summer, four years later, a special government committee will finally report on which to adopt., In the past, however, commercial and recreational fishers have blocked many protection efforts., “In the marine space there are many who assert their rights and fewer who assert their responsibilities,” says Sage, the minister for conservation., “Any change is hotly contested, and I hope now that people realise how serious it is and how urgent. Our shared goal must surely be a healthy Hauraki Gulf.

The analysts on Thursday slashed forecasts for new solar power projects by 8%. It expected sales of electric vehicles to stall too., “We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition,” Birol said. He said global governments should use the economic stimulus packages which are being planned to help countries weather the downturn to invest in clean energy technologies., He added: “We have an important window of opportunity. Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.”, The IEA’s analysis has shown 70% of the world’s clean energy investments are government-driven, either through direct government finance or in response to policies such as subsidies or taxes. The watchdog has also found government fossil fuel subsidies total $400bn (£300bn) each year., Birol urged global governments to invest in energy efficiency measures, which might not offer good short-term returns while energy prices are low but would prove a lucrative investment in the longer-term., The IEA head also urged policymakers to use the downturn in global oil prices to phase out or scrap fossil fuels subsidies, which could be used to boost healthcare spending., “These challenging market conditions will be a clear test for government commitments,” he said. “But the good news is that compared to economic stimulus packages of the past we have much cheaper renewable technologies, have made major progress in electric vehicles, and there is a supportive financial community for the clean energy transition., “If the right policies are put in place there are opportunities to make the best of this situation,” he added.coronovirus poses threat to climate action says watchdog", "label": 0}, "train-483": {"text": "\nRevealed: Monsanto’s secret funding for weedkiller studies\n, The research, used to help avoid a ban, claimed ‘severe impacts’ on farming if glyphosate was outlawed, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nThu 12 Mar 2020 13.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 12 Mar 2020 15.00 EDT\n\n, Monsanto secretly funded academic studies indicating “very severe impacts” on farming and the environment if its controversial glyphosate weedkiller were banned, an investigation has found., The research was used by the National Farmers’ Union and others to successfully lobby against a European ban in 2017. As a result of the revelations, the NFU has now amended its glyphosate information to declare the source of the research., Monsanto was bought by the agri-chemical multinational Bayer in 2018 and Bayer said the studies’ failure to disclose their funding broke its principles. However, the authors of the studies said the funding did not influence their work and the editor of the journal in which they were published said the papers would not be retracted or amended., Glyphosate is sold by Bayer as Roundup and is the world’s most widely used weedkiller. The World Health Organization’s cancer agency, the IARC, declared that glyphosate was “probably carcinogenic to humans” in 2015 but several international agencies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), subsequently came to opposite conclusions., Last year courts in the US ordered Monsanto to pay damages of up to $2bn (£1.5bn) to individuals with cancer and faces many more lawsuits. Bayer said it “stands fully behind its glyphosate-based products”., The new revelations centre on studies published in 2010 and 2014 by researchers at ADAS, an agricultural and environmental consultancy in the UK. The analyses concluded “the loss of glyphosate would cause very severe impacts on UK agriculture and the environment”. They suggested a 20% fall in wheat and rapeseed production. However, other researchers at another consultancy, the Andersons Centre, said: “We believe that this may be rather high.”, Glyphosate weedkiller allows planting without ploughing, which helps stop carbon being released to the atmosphere. The ADAS research indicated a 25% increase in greenhouse gas emissions – a rise of 12m tonnes a year – if glyphosate was banned., The ADAS research was used by the NFU in lobbying against an EU ban in 2017 when the renewal of the licence for glyphosate was being considered. The industry lobby group, the Glyphosate Task Force (now renamed the Glyphosate Renewal Group), also used the research, as did the Crop Protection Association., Despite a petition from 1.2 million citizens calling for a ban, the pesticide licence was renewed for five years. However, this was far shorter than the 15 years that had been sought., The secret funding of the ADAS studies was uncovered by a German transparency campaign group, LobbyControl. In December, LobbyControl revealed two pro-glyphosate German studies that were partly funded by Monsanto and published in 2011 and 2015 without the funding being declared., “This is an unacceptable form of opaque lobbying,” said Ulrich Müller at LobbyControl. “Citizens, media and decision-makers should know who pays for studies on subjects of public interest. The studies also used very high figures for the benefits of glyphosate and for possible losses in case of a ban. These extreme figures were then used to spin the debate.”, The tendency of the results of scientific studies to favour their funders – called funding bias – is widely recognised in research on chemical toxicity, tobacco and pharmaceutical drugs., A spokesman for Bayer said the company always disclosed its funding of third-party scientific publications. “The lack of reference to the funding of these studies does not meet Bayer’s principles,” he said., He added: “Glyphosate-based herbicides have been used safely and successfully for more than 40 years. They are one of the most thoroughly studied products of their kind. We have no reason to doubt the methods, content or results of the studies conducted by ADAS.”, Sarah Wynn, at ADAS and one of the authors of the studies, said: “As with other companies in our field, it is entirely normal for external organisations to fund research studies. However, it has always been our core principle that our research is never influenced in any way by those that fund us.” ADAS is now leading another project on glyphosate that was partly funded by Monsanto., Leonard Copping, editor of the journal Outlooks on Pest Management, in which the studies were published, said: “The authors did not advise me of the source of the funding. For this reason it was not disclosed. Conflict of interests is important but not relevant in this case. The papers will not be amended or retracted.”, However, following an enquiry from the Guardian, the NFU has amended its glyphosate material. “We are happy to add a line to the online article stating that the research on this occasion was funded by Monsanto,” said an NFU spokesman., Bayer said farmers around the globe rely on glyphosate to provide enough food for the world’s growing population. But campaigners claim Monsanto has defended the product by ghostwriting research papers for regulators and using front groups to discredit critical scientists and journalists. In 2017, the Guardian revealed that EFSA based its recommendation that glyphosate was safe on an EU report that copied and pasted analyses from a Monsanto study.revealed monsantos secret funding for weedkiller studies roundup", "label": 0}, "train-484": {"text": "\nDavid Attenborough calls for ban on 'devastating' deep sea mining\n, \nDavid Attenborough calls for ban on 'devastating' deep sea mining\n, Proposed mining of seabed could destroy unstudied ecosystems and disrupt vital carbon-storing functions, says naturalist, \nKaren McVeigh, \n\nThu 12 Mar 2020 12.56 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 12 Mar 2020 13.33 EDT\n\n, Sir David Attenborough has urged governments to ban deep sea mining, following a study warning of “potentially disastrous” risks to the ocean’s life-support systems if it goes ahead., The study, by Fauna and Flora International (FFI), warns proposed plans to mine the seabed could cause significant loss of biodiversity, disruption of the ocean’s “biological pump”, and the loss of microbes important for storing carbon. The process, requiring machines operating thousands of metres under the sea, could also create plumes of sediment that smother areas far from the mining sites and kill wildlife., Dozens of exploratory licences, two of which are sponsored by the UK, have already been granted for huge tracts of the sea bed, ahead of a race to mine commercially for ores and minerals such as copper, used in mobile phones and batteries. But the rules to govern the responsible exploitation of this global resource are not finalised – they are expected to be completed at a meeting in July at the UN International Seabed Authority., Attenborough, the vice president of FFI, said deep sea mining could create a “devastating series of impacts” threatening processes critical to the health and function of the oceans, and called on governments to be guided by scientists., “Fauna &amp; Flora International is calling on global governments to put in place a moratorium on all deep sea mining – a call I wholeheartedly support,” Attenborough said., In a foreword to the report, Attenborough said it was “beyond reason” for countries to consider the destruction of deep sea places before they have understood them or the role they play in the health of the planet., Attenborough said: “The rush to mine this pristine and unexplored environment risks creating terrible impacts that cannot be reversed. We need to be guided by science when faced with decisions of such great environmental consequence.”, FFI warned that human activity was already putting a huge strain on the oceans, which have absorbed a third of our carbon emissions and 93% of the extra heat trapped by the rising concentration of greenhouse gases., Oceans are becoming more acidic because of the carbon dioxide dissolving into them, fisheries are under pressure as a result of over-exploitation and there are hundreds of huge “dead zones”, it said., Pippa Howard, director at FFI and lead author of the report, called for a moratorium on deep sea mining. She said: “The conclusions we have come to after extensive study could hardly be more troubling., “From methane release to disruption of the ocean’s life-support systems and the destruction of unstudied ecosystems, the risks of deep sea mining are numerous and potentially disastrous.”, Louise Casson, of Greenpeace’s Protect the Oceans campaign, said the UK government’s holding of exploration contracts for deep sea mining was at odds with its position as a “global ocean champion”.Casson said: “The UK government now has a choice to make: listen to industry and press ahead with this dangerous new practice, or listen to scientific warnings, public concern and the creator of Blue Planet himself and ban deep sea mining.”, A government spokesman said: “The UK continues to press for the highest international environmental standards, including on deep sea mineral extraction., “While we have sponsored two exploration licences, these allow only for marine research to understand the effects of deep sea mining., “We will not issue a single exploitation licence without a full assessment of the environmental impact.”david attenborough calls for ban on devastating deep sea mining", "label": 0}, "train-485": {"text": "\nWales launches £5m national forest scheme – with pupils' help\n, Green corridor for wildlife will also help to meet carbon targets, \nSteven Morris, \n\nThu 12 Mar 2020 11.16 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 12 Mar 2020 13.50 EDT\n\n, It was hard, chilly work for nine-year-old Alfie Perry and his eight-year-old classmate Dempsey Owens., But, after a bit of cajoling from their pals and teacher on a windswept hillside above the town of Neath, the pair succeeded in planting a sessile oak that could soon be part of a forest stretching continuously the length and breadth of Wales., The Welsh government is initially ploughing £5m into its national forest scheme, aiming to link existing woodland with new forests, parkland and hedges, creating green corridors for flora and fauna – and people., The Labour-led government says the scheme will help it to create new, important environments, meet carbon reduction targets, combat flooding – but also boost tourism and people’s sense of wellbeing as they criss-cross the country under, or next to, trees., Lesley Griffiths, the Welsh government’s environment minister, was on hand in Neath to help Alfie and Dempsey dig and set out the vision., “We love our woodland in Wales,” Griffiths said. “Welsh businesses, communities and, particularly, our farmers and foresters, will want to help create the national forest.”, Griffiths accepted there would be challenges but pointed out that people had doubted the country could create a footpath right around the coast, but it had done just that. “We’re a small country. You’re able to do things differently.”, The spot for the launch – Coed Brynau - is a beautiful one. High above Neath, with views of the Brecon Beacons and the Mumbles Lighthouse, Coed Cadw (the Woodland Trust in Wales) is in the process of planting 150,000 trees here by 2025, including rare species such as the small-leaved lime and the black poplar., The estate used to be owned by the coalmine owner and Tory MP Herbert Mackworth (1687-1765), who created a parkland on the hill. There are vestiges of ancient woodland that will be linked with the new tree planting., The area is home to barn owls, Daubenton’s bats and possibly the very rare blue ground beetle. Welsh white cows, which look ghostly in the landscape, are being introduced to graze grassland areas of the site., There is not yet a route for the forest – this will evolve as the consultation moves on., But Natalie Buttriss, director of Coed Cadw, suggested one option could be to link the great forest of Wentwood in Monmouthshire along the M4 corridor to Coed Brynau., It could then head north towards the “Celtic rainforest” of mid Wales and Snowdonia, one of the most important and historic habitats in Wales, and perhaps veer east towards Wrexham, where a plan is in place to increase the urban tree canopy to a minimum of 20% by 2026., Chris Matts, Coed Cadw’s woodland manager for south and west Wales, likes the government’s ambition, though he thinks perhaps forest is the wrong word. “It’s a word that in English originally meant a hunting ground for kings,” he said., Matts prefers the Welsh word: coed, which has more of the connotation of “an area of trees”, which takes in parkland and hedgerows as well as thick forest and woodland., Mary Gagen, a professor of geography at Swansea University, praised the ambition of the scheme. “We need to get trees in the ground now. Trees are a brilliant multi-tasker, good for the environment, good for habitats, good for us.”, The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the February floods reinforced the need to plant more trees., “In planting, growing and protecting the right network of trees we can increase our resilience to flooding., “Trees improve air quality, they remove harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, they provide material for construction, they regenerate soil for food, they clean the water in our rivers and they provide a home to all the life that finds shelter in their canopy., “The project is ambitious and dynamic and will not grow overnight. Over the next 20 years, we will work with all kinds of stakeholders – from the Woodland Trust to farmers, landowners and school pupils – to grow the right network of trees that will greatly improve biodiversity, trap carbon from the air and provide economic opportunities too., “These ambitious projects work – the Wales Coast Path, which created a path around the entire coastline of Wales, has been a real success story.

Just last year, taps were turned off in more than 23,000 homes, three-fifths of which were still without water by mid-January 2020., There is no vaccine or treatment for coronavirus, also known as Covid-19. According to the World Health Organization, good hygiene, specifically frequent hand-washing with soap, is crucial to prevent the virus spreading., Amid growing pressure to act, Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Detroit city officials this week announced plans to stop shutoffs and temporarily reconnect water services for all residents, as part of a plan to prevent spread of the coronavirus., “The state is stepping up to cover the cost of water restoration for the first 30 days, because it’s the right thing to do to keep families safe and protect public health,” Whitmer said., The governor later declared a state of emergency, after confirmation of the first two Covid-19 cases in the state. Both patients, an unrelated middle-aged man and woman from Detroit, were hospitalised. At least 12 states across the US have declared emergencies as cases have risen past 1,000, with 31 deaths confirmed., Church leaders and poverty campaigners had urged Whitmer to suspend water shutoffs., “The unconscionable act of depriving anyone of water because the cost is more than they can afford has resulted in a health crisis,” said the Detroit People’s Water Board, a coalition of social justice organizations, in February, adding that the coronavirus outbreak “has the serious potential to be magnified and spread due to thousands not having access to water”., Nicole Hill, 47, was disconnected in 2015, after falling behind with monthly bills which had quadrupled over five years., “Having your water shut off is horrendous,” she said. “I ended up in hospital with bacterial pneumonia when my water was shut off. Now with coronavirus, I’m really frightened for people.”, Water affordability is a growing problem across the US, as low-income households struggle to pay increasingly expensive bills. Numerous public water utilities have increased shutoffs, ostensibly to encourage people to pay up on time., But many low-income households struggle to keep up with rent, gas and other bills too and in 2016, according to research by Food and Water Watch (FWW), an estimated 15 million Americans were disconnected from running water after failing to pay., “The United States has been facing a water affordability crisis for years,” said Mary Grant, director of an FWW campaign which calls for federal action to stop shutoffs and introduce affordability programmes nationwide., “Now, threats of the coronavirus are finally making it clear to our elected officials: water shutoffs are not only inhumane but also a public health nightmare., “Detroit’s plan to halt water shutoffs is long overdue. It should not have taken the coronavirus epidemic.”, Almost four in 10 Detroit residents live in poverty, the highest rate among the 20 largest US cities. Water rates have increased by as much as 400% in the last 20 years., In 2014, shortly after filing the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history, the city launched a massive shutoff programme. In its first year, 31,000 households had their water shut off., The UN described the shutoffs as “contrary to human rights” and condemned the disproportionate impact on African Americans, who account for 80% of the city., Under this week’s temporary plan, the state will cover water bills for the first month, after which customers can pay a reduced rate of $25 a month to stay connected until the crisis abates., But it is unclear how many households will be reconnected, and how quickly., Alice Jennings, a Detroit lawyer and member of the People’s Water Board, told the Guardian the board welcomed “the acknowledgment by the governor and mayor to stop the water shutoffs and restore water services but this is crisis intervention and not a solution to a permanent problem”., In Washington, Frank Pallone, chair of the House energy and commerce committee, and Peter DeFazio, chair of the transportation and infrastructure panel, urged water utility companies across the country to follow Detroit’s lead., “Access to clean water is a basic human right at all times,” they said, “but any action that restricts families’ access to water during the current coronavirus outbreak would be reckless in the extreme.”, In Seattle, the worst-hit US city so far, water and electricity shutoffs have been suspended., For those still without water, Covid-19 poses a terrifying threat., In Detroit, Marjorie Davis and her children have lived without running water for almost five years. It was disconnected in summer 2015 after Davis, 46 and reliant on welfare benefits, was unable to keep up with bill payments. She owed about $1,000., “It’s a nightmare,” said Davis, whose name has been changed to protect the family’s privacy. “I’ve tried to get help but the city’s affordability plan doesn’t work. I can’t afford it.”, She has relied on bottled water, sanitary wipes and the kindness of neighbours, who refill bottles and let her and the children take occasional showers. The family are forced to use a hospital commode, which is emptied into the trash., “This virus is killing people all over the world and we can’t flush the toilet or wash our hands regularly,” Davis said. “It’s messing with my mind, I don’t know what to do., “I’m so worried about myself and my children.”detroit water shutoffs unpaid bills coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-488": {"text": "\nCuttlefish added to red food list after stocks decline in Channel\n, Charity says rise in catches putting strain on stocks, but brown crab is back on the menu, \nRebecca Smithers Consumer affairs correspondent, \n\nThu 12 Mar 2020 03.00 EDT\n\n, Consumers are being urged to avoid eating cuttlefish caught by trawlers in the Channel to help alleviate pressure on threatened stocks., A rise in prices has fuelled an increase in catches of the molluscs over the last decade, with landings in the UK in 2018 worth a record £14.9m, the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said.

It’s not that early in the day, but it looks like I’m the first to break the crust of the snow on the path leading up to the open moor. White-faced sheep warily watch me go by., Last time I was up here the moor from Baildon to Ilkley was gripped by heatwave, the land groaning and cracked under the weight of the weather. Not now.

Today I don’t see any at all. Instead I see another bird of whom it might be said, as Shakespeare’s Helena says of Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, “though she be but little, she is fierce”.

Solar power in Japan was forecast to be a better option than new coal by 2023 and existing coal by 2026., The story was similar in China and South Korea, which each take about 15% of Australia’s exported thermal coal. In China, wind was already cheaper than any coal power, and solar electricity was forecast to on average cost less than existing coal later this year. Renewable energy in South Korea was expected to be cheaper than existing coal within two years., The report acknowledged this trend did not necessarily mean coal power would be pushed from the market within a decade. It said some governments were effectively incentivising or underwriting new coal power through regulatory programs that either directly subsidised coal operators or passed the higher cost on to consumers., But the group found that coal power would struggle if markets were priced fairly. It called on governments to block new coal projects and phase our existing coal plants, in part by changing regulations to allow renewable energy to compete on a level playing field., Carbon Tracker’s Matt Gray, a co-author of the report, said proposed coal investments risked becoming stranded assets that locked in increasingly expensive power for decades. The analysis found that developers risked wasting more than $600bn if all mooted coal-fired plants were built., “The market is driving the low-carbon energy transition but governments aren’t listening,” Gray said. “It makes economic sense for governments to cancel new coal projects immediately and progressively phase out existing plants.”, Christiana Figueres, a former head UN climate chief who oversaw negotiations on the Paris agreement and is in Australian on a book tour, said demand for coal had been diminishing, having been overtaken by cheaper gas-fired power in the US and outpriced by solar in India. She said the price of solar and onshore and offshore wind were falling consistently., “No one should not assume that the demand for thermal coal from Australia is actually elastic. It’s not,” Figueres said., Australia is the world’s second largest thermal coal exporter after Indonesia, and is the biggest trader in metallurgical coal, which is used in steel making., The export value of both forms of coal dropped notably last year. The spot price of thermal coal slumped more than a third from US$100.73 to US$66.20, its biggest fall in more than a decade., Before the coronavirus outbreak, the government’s latest resources and quarterly energy report estimated the declining price would cut earnings from thermal coal exports from a record A$26bn in 2018-19 to A$20.6bn this financial year., In terms of coal use, the International Energy Agency found it declined last year, but forecast a slight increase over the next five years due to rising demand from India., A more detailed analysis by several thinktanks found that coal-fired electricity fell about 3% in 2019, the biggest drop on record after more than four decades of near-uninterrupted growth in which coal power has been a primary driver of the climate crisis. China’s use of coal plants continued to climb while generation in the US and Europe fell by 16% and nearly a quarter., Within Australia, black and brown coal provide about two-thirds of the electricity used in the five eastern states, but this is expected to fall as old plants continue to close. According to federal government projections, renewable energy is expected to meet nearly 50% of national demand by 2030., In 2018 the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change examined how rapidly global coal power needed to be phased out to give the world a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C , a goal referenced in the Paris agreement., It found this would require a cut of 59% to 78% below 2010 levels by 2030, before declining to zero.wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper than coal in all big markets around world analysis finds", "label": 0}, "train-491": {"text": "\nThe week in wildlife – in pictures\n, The week in wildlife – in pictures, The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including the last female white giraffe and boxing hares, , \n\nFri 13 Mar 2020 13.45 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 15 Apr 2020 20.16 EDT\n\n, Photograph: Ozgun Tiran/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images, Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA, Photograph: Chris Strickland/Alamy, Photograph: Patrik Stollarz/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Ingolf König-Jablonski/dpa-Zentralbild/ZB, Photograph: Roger Cox/2020 Mammal Photographer of the Year, Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA, Photograph: Karl-Josef Hildenbrand/dpa, Photograph: Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Chaideer Mahyuddin/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Andy Wong/AP, Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: EPA, Photograph: Richard Robinson, Photograph: Kate MacRae/2020 Mammal Photographer of the Year, Photograph: Pete Stevens/2020 UK National Parks Photography Competitionthe week in wildlife in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-492": {"text": "\nCarbon benefits of fast-growing trees have been clearly proven\n, Letters, \n\nFri 13 Mar 2020 12.46 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 13 Mar 2020 13.50 EDT\n\n, The article based on the RSPB’s recent report (Tree plantations ‘do not help climate’ as timber not used over long term, 11 March) is an unhelpful contribution to the critical debate on land use in the context of the climate crisis., The danger with the article, and the RSPB report, is that it undermines the scientific argument for a significant increase in commercial conifer planting., A recent report from the government’s Committee on Climate Change, entitled Land use: policies for a net zero UK, makes it clear that we need to increase “UK forestry cover from 13% to at least 17% by 2050 by planting around 30,000 hectares or more of broadleaf and conifer woodland each year” and the conifers are needed for “wood in construction, creating an additional stock of carbon in the built environment”. This construction timber will be substituted for concrete and steel, which together are responsible for 12% of global carbon emissions., There is little point in saving the curlew’s habitat if, as a consequence, we lose the battle against climate change. It’s time the RSPB acknowledged the bigger picture.Paul BrannenFormer MEP and member of the EU’s agriculture committee, • Government policy is based on advice from independent organisations like the Committee on Climate Change, which examine the evidence on carbon sequestration to take a full life-cycle picture., The full evidence on the carbon benefits of fast-growing trees does take into account all the uses of wood harvested in the UK and recognises that the trees are replaced with new fast-growing trees., Wood burned for energy replaces non-renewable fossil fuels, and wood used, for example, in a fence, does not magically give up its carbon to the atmosphere when that fence is replaced (with more wood). Typically, it is reused and recycled. This adds to the positive carbon story and is an exemplar of reuse., It is irresponsible to raise the spectre of land management practices, specifically planting on ground containing deep peat, which ended decades ago and will not happen again. The claims that newly planted native woodlands are much richer in wildlife than modern forests planted to produce wood and designed against high standards is also not supported by the evidence., If we are serious about tackling climate change and benefiting nature, we need to base policy on the full suite of evidence and embrace positive solutions.Stuart GoodallChief executive, Confor: Promoting forestry and wood, • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com, • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters, • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

It is one of many areas created for human use that has become a wildlife haven, \nAmy Fleming, \n\nFri 13 Mar 2020 10.37 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 13 Mar 2020 10.42 EDT\n\n, With its trees still naked after winter, Lordship Road in the London borough of Hackney is an urban vista of asphalt, brick and concrete. Heading north, a pair of tower blocks loom from the horizon. Pounding its pavements to the soundtrack of vans accelerating between speed bumps, it’s hard to imagine that behind the barbed-wire-topped fence on my right, obscured by a tall, grassy bank, lies a nature reserve that is more biodiverse than much of what we consider the real countryside., As soon as you enter Woodberry wetlands, the soundtrack changes to an enthusiastic avian choir. The high-pitched honks of the coots that live year round on this drinking-water reservoir punctuate the shrill chatter and song of robins, blackbirds, dunnocks, greenfinches, parakeets, wrens, warblers, tits (great, long-tailed and blue) and many more. The 11 hectares of wide-open space is calming, like a giant deep breath, while the enigmatic rustles and darting movements of nature going about its business are delightful and reassuring., The reservoir was built in 1833, but was developed as wetlands with thriving reed beds and opened to the public in 2016. This is the result of investing in what the natural history writer and television producer Stephen Moss calls our accidental countryside. “My definition of it is quite simple,” he says. “Excluding farmland and gardens, it’s any place that was created originally for human use that wildlife either stayed in, or found and moved into later.”, From ancient ruins, to disused railways, these unintended havens dot the British landscape. Tate Modern, on the Thames, with its nesting peregrine falcons, counts as accidental countryside. So do motorway service stations, which birders keen to spy pied wagtails know offer birds more food than neighbouring sprayed fields. Stonework in cemeteries attracts more than 600 species of lichen – a composite organism of algae and fungi living in symbiosis – some of which are hundreds of years old. “None of these places were designed for wildlife,” says Moss., In a country in which farms take up almost 57% of the land, the tiny, unmeasured fraction of accidental countryside we have needs protecting, says Moss, who made programmes with Bill Oddie for many years and has been a birder since boyhood. “Our society is geared to paying farmers very little money to produce huge amounts of food so supermarkets can make big profits and we have cheap food. Everyone’s happy except the farmers and the wildlife,” he says., He quotes the environmentalist Chris Baines who said that one way to improve the biodiversity of an arable field is to build a housing estate on it. “This may sound glib, but he was being entirely serious,” writes Moss in his new book, The Accidental Countryside. “Most arable fields are monocultural deserts, with virtually no wildlife, whereas Britain’s gardens are often home to a suite of former woodland birds and other wild creatures.”, It is birders and other nature spotters who are often first to realise the ecological value of accidental havens. The classic example, says Moss, is Belfast docks. “They decommissioned three huge docks, and they left them because you can’t build on them straight away. The silt has to settle. Of course the birds turned up, birds brought seeds, plants grew, and suddenly you had this fantastic place in the 1980s or 90s, where birders would climb over the fence and watch the birds.” It is now a RSPB-managed nature reserve, “in the middle of Belfast docks and it’s incredible”., Occasionally, the thought of inviting the public into these sites has made naturalists nervous. “It’s this idea that they’ll spoil it for us,” says Moss. But the birds won’t get frightened away, he says, because they’re used to people. He’s right. I used to regularly hang out with leggy herons on the human-made New River in Islington. One once stood unselfconsciously a few feet away from me, with a pair of kicking frogs legs dangling from its beak. “If I walk along in the countryside and see a heron, it will fly away, the way the foxes run away,” says Moss. “But here, you could walk up to them.” Even here, however, you will only see the iridescent blue flash of the cautious kingfisher if you are really lucky., Cities invite biodiversity, says Moss, partly because they provide warmth – the reason he suspects he spotted his first bumblebee of the year here today, rather than near his home in Somerset. “There’s a longer growing season so there’s more natural and semi-natural food, places to nest and food that we provide.”, Moss is staunchly pro feeding the ducks. “There are a lot of theories about feeding ducks, but ducks eat lots of other stuff anyway,” he says. He sees the ritual as a gateway for connecting with nature. “I’m only here because, when I was three, my mum took me to feed the ducks and I asked her what the funny black ones were.” When he got home, he leafed through the Observer’s Book of Birds to discover they were in fact coots. “That was my first bird spot, the funny black duck. So feeding the ducks is incredibly important. It’s better if you can feed them seed, but not everyone can afford that. There’s a nice coot down there now,” he says, binoculars at the ready., “There are some long-tailed tits coming through here, see? A little flock of them,” he says, pointing to the brambles on the outer edge of the reed beds. “They build amazing little ball-shaped nests out of lichen and spider’s web.” He picks out the call of a cetti’s warbler from the throng, once a rare sound in cities., Sparrow populations, meanwhile, have declined in towns and cities where they used to be common, by 60% since the 70s and Moss said we won’t see one today. Gazing into the reeds now, however, he says: “That looks remarkably like a sparrow. It is a sparrow, how amazing.”, Over the past 20 years, he says, “there’s been a real understanding amongst conservationists that these places are not bolt-on extras, but they are where the wildlife is. Because it ain’t in the field.” At Canvey Wick in Essex, for example, a disused oil refinery is now known as a “brownfield rainforest”, home to rare insects. “Being further east, it has a more continental climate. It has the second most invertebrates of anywhere in Britain. Some of these sites are extraordinarily biodiverse.”, And yet because they have been previously developed by humans, they are classified as brownfield, and are therefore fair game for development. Moss argues that in terms of boosting biodiversity, it could be better to build on fields than rewilded brownfield sites., “This is quite controversial,” he concedes. “Not everyone will agree with me. But fundamentally what I’m saying is, if your brownfield site is in the middle of Finsbury Park in London and it’s an old garage that’s not needed any more, of course you should build housing on it. The problem is, the word brownfield is used for anything where there has been some kind of industrial build.”, While building on “green” land seems sacrilege, he says we have an exaggerated notion of how built up Britain really is. According to the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, 7% of Britain is built on, rising to 10.6% in England alone. In 2012, the BBC reporter Mark Easton analysed this statistic and found that when you take into account urban gardens, parks and other green areas, the proportion of England that is built up drops to 2.3% (and lower nationally)., “Given that we need to build so many new homes to alleviate the current housing crisis, perhaps we should consider a radical solution: putting at least some of them in the countryside itself,” writes Moss., In 1993, Thames Water put the site of Woodberry wetlands up for sale, but local residents campaigned against building over the reservoirs (one has become the nature reserve while the other is a leisure and water-sports centre.) Other potential reserves haven’t been so lucky. Perry Oaks sewage farm in west London, once rich with migratory waders such as wood and green sandpipers, was obliterated in 2002 by Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 5., Some smaller nature havens don’t even have names. One particular pond known to wildlife fans on the edge of the Chilterns to the west of London, home to the rare southern damselfly, had been drained when Moss returned to it as his book was going to press. And the rich surrounding vegetation, beloved of butterflies, had been cleared. “That’s the fate of so much of the accidental countryside,” Moss writes., Strolling around the reservoir at Woodberry wetlands, we pass walkers and runners wearing blissful expressions. “One of the most exciting things the accidental countryside offers,” says Moss, “is making nature available to everyone.” A mother watches the water birds (there are five species of gull) while her toddler plays with stones on the pathway. And a lone walker bids us good morning – something strangers rarely do in London., The Accidental Countryside: Hidden Havens for Britain’s Wildlife by Stephen Moss is published by Faber &amp; Faber on 19 March.

There was no light, there was nothing.”, He spent days with neighbours and rescue workers digging survivors and the dead out of the earth and was housed with hundreds of other residents in a local school before being allowed to go home., Days earlier, five people died during heavy rains across Rio de Janeiro. One man drowned when the Acari favela in north Rio was flooded. Bruna Aguiar, an activist from the favela’s Fala Akari collective, said rains have worsened there since a flood in 2013., “Older people talk about other floods in the 1970s, but nothing of this magnitude,” she said., According to data from Brazil’s National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet), one Rio de Janeiro weather station logged 134 extreme rainfalls from 1960 to 1990, and 221 from 1990 to 2020. A São Paulo weather station reported 15 from 1960 to 1990 and 44 since., “There’s clearly been an increase of extreme events in the south-east of Brazil,” Ambrizzi said., His own research from São Paulo – capital of the state where four people died in two days in February following heavy rainfall – backs this up., Data from two weather stations in the city showed an increase in extreme rain events, according to a paper Ambrizzi and other scientists published in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences last month. The dry season has begun extending from September into October in recent decades, they found., “This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas, such as slopes and banks of water-courses, leads to inundation, flooding and landslides,” the paper said. “Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate variability but can also be related to global warming and/or urbanisation.”, “Urban heat islands” created by the concrete and lack of vegetation in big cities increase temperatures, scientists said, and lack of permeable ground means more flooding. Global warming exacerbates the effect., “When it is hotter, it rains more, and this gets worse if you have urban areas, areas of concrete and asphalt,” said José Marengo from Brazil’s National Centre for Monitoring and Alerts of Natural Disasters, and another of the paper’s authors., Not all scientists hold global warming responsible. Brazil’s Space Research Institute said the rains were “meteorological phenomena typical of summer”, and blamed them on the South Atlantic convergence zone – “a band of clouds that channels moisture from the Amazon and the tropical Atlantic Ocean” for three days or more, producing heavy rain and cold fronts. Nor has the rain increased everywhere: the north-east has seen more extreme droughts, it said., “You can’t generalise everything and blame global warming for everything,” said Josélia Pegorim, a meteorologist from the Climatempo weather service, while noting summer’s rains have been exceptional. “We are breaking records,” she said., In January, 59 people were killed during heavy rains in Minas Gerais state. According to Inmet data, its capital Belo Horizonte saw 30 “extreme rain” events from 1960 to 1990, and 52 from 1990 to 2020., In Belo Horizonte, 13 people were killed in January, when 935mm of rain was recorded at one weather station – the highest level since 1910, and more than half the rainfall expected for the whole year., Extreme rain events and consecutive droughts are likely to continue, said Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil’s leading climate scientists and a senior researcher at the University of São Paulo’s Institute for Advanced Studies. “This is the new normal,” he said.climate crisis blamed for rains and floods that have killed 150 in brazil", "label": 0}, "train-495": {"text": "\nInspired by Nature, National Parks Photography Competition 2020\n, Inspired by Nature, National Parks Photography Competition 2020, The UK National Parks and Campaign for National Parks are delighted to announce the winner, runner up and shortlisted entrants for our joint photography competition underscoring the importance of nature in our national parks., The competition, around the theme of ‘inspired by nature’, drew about 1,700 entries via social media.

It was the late 1970s, the roads were impassable and we walked to a pub a mile away through waist-high drifts. Set on a slight rise above the level meadows of the North Tyne, the old coaching inn (now a B&amp;B) was named The Moorcock.

In Falstone village, there is still a pub called The Blackcock., The names of places in Northumberland often drew on the land’s birdlife. Plover Hill is on a high ridge where golden plover and lapwings would nest in spring. An 18th-century farmhouse near Bardon Mill is delightfully named Partridge Nest, and likely refers to the native grey partridge rather than the introduced red-legged species. Woodcock Hall was a house near Bellingham, and Cockrumple was, according to Godfrey Watson’s Northumberland Place Names: Goodwife Hot and Other Places, “apparently inspired by the likeness of the Land to the Rump of a Woodcock sitting on her nest”., Then there’s Lark Hall and Laverock Hall, laverock being an old northern word for skylark; Mavis Farm and the Throstle, from other names for the song thrush; the simply named Sparrow House and the more evolved Sook Hill and Sugley. I imagine that Curleheugh means the rugged hillside where there are curlews, and Cranecleugh is a reminder that there were once cranes here., Curlew, skylark, plover, song thrush, house sparrow, woodcock and black grouse – they are all among the 67 species that appear on the Red List of Britain’s most vulnerable birds.

But the council’s chief executive said it was told that operations could not be halted when Forestry Corporation was not in breach of its approvals., The council is now calling on the state government to suspend the coastal integrated forestry operations approval (IFOA) until assessments of the impact of the fires are complete., “They’ve Forestry Corporation finished their operation in Styx River so my guess is whatever damage was going to be done has been done,” Gambian said., “But it’s not too late to halt operations everywhere else in the state.”, Gambian said the government should offer an assistance package to the industry to support timber communities., “We understand there are communities that rely on the timber industry for their survival,” he said. “This shouldn’t be a fight between the timber industry and koalas.”, Since the fire crisis, the forestry industry has pushed for more access to burnt areas of forest for logging., But state politicians have been surprised to learn that logging of unburnt areas has continued as per harvesting plans., In an estimates hearing last Friday, the Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann said Forestry Corporation had told an inquiry into the state’s koala populations “it was no longer logging unburnt forest while this assessment of the impact on threatened species was continuing”., “Yet, in fact, in the Styx River state forest, they were continuing to log and the EPA realised that,” Faehrmann said., She asked EPA officials whether the burning of more than 80% of the Hastings River mouse’s habitat had prompted them to suggest logging operations in remaining habitat should stop., “Did that not trigger anything within the EPA to suggest to State Forests that it should stop logging those compartments where probably the last few little Hastings River mice, post-fire, were potentially living?” she asked., Officials said they would respond on notice with the scientific advice they received., But they said EPA ecologists had raised concerns about the impact of logging on species affected by fire., “There were issues raised and concern raised about post-fire logging activity and the impact on species,” David Fowler of the EPA told the hearing., The steering committee for the Great Koala national park met with the environment minister, Matt Kean, this week and asked him to investigate logging operations in the Lower Bucca state forest., “We requested an immediate end to logging in unburnt forest on the north coast, particularly unburnt forest that is known koala habitat,” Ashley Love a member of the steering committee and the Bellingen Environment Centre said., Love said the operations were in a significant patch of forest he described as “the largest unburnt remnant within the proposed Great Koala national park”., The Bees Nest fire on the NSW north coast burnt large amounts of koala habitat to the west of the Lower Bucca., Love said it meant the Lower Bucca was now potentially an important site for surviving populations that might later repopulate burnt areas when the bushland recovered., Guardian Australia sought comment from the forestry minister, John Barilaro, and from Kean., Response was provided via the NSW Forestry Corporation, which said 70% of its harvesting operations on the north coast had been moved into plantations., A spokeswoman said there were “a small number of areas of unburnt forest still being harvested, maintaining sustainable timber supplies in demand for rebuilding and work in communities where employment in forestry and the timber industry is important”., “There are strict regulations around forestry operations that were developed by expert scientific panels to ensure a high level of protection for wildlife during harvesting operations,” she said., The spokeswoman said Forestry Corporation was also working with NSW government agencies, led by the EPA, to “develop appropriate conditions for harvesting timber from a small proportion of forests that are set aside for timber production and affected by fire”., But the independent MP Justin Field said it was “unacceptable to the community that some of our last unburnt forests are being logged before the assessment of the impact of these fires has even been completed”., “Forestry Corporation need to be called to account by the forestry minister and the environment minister.

Its leaders have been willing to try something new and now they are starting to see the results.”, Dennett said Salford had invested millions in green infrastructure and had embraced the decarbonisation agenda long before it was in vogue. “Our carbon management programme was put in place in 2009 and has helped to save 14,000 tonnes of CO2,” he said. “And 60% of Salford is now green space.”, According to the study, the least sustainable area in England and Wales is Stockton-on-Tees in the north-east. It has well over double the average CO2 emissions, nearly half the average recycling rates, and fewer trees than most authorities., The full analysis – which rates 363 local authorities on 60 indicators covering sustainability, equality and local conditions – reveals that Richmond upon Thames offers the best quality of life overall. Residents of the affluent south London borough have the best mental and physical health, along with the most trusting neighbours., Stockton-on-Tees also has one of the worst scores overall. Its poorest children make less progress than those living in most other areas, while the scale of its health challenges dwarfs those found elsewhere. It has the largest life-expectancy gap in England and Wales, with people in deprived areas dying on average more than 16 years earlier than in the better-off parts of the borough., One of the most culturally diverse areas in the study, Brent in north-west London, was found to be the most egalitarian place in England and Wales. Its council chamber is fully representative of its black and minority ethic population – an achievement matched by only 21 other councils. It has more than half the average gender pay gap, with children from disadvantaged backgrounds standing a better chance of doing well at school and getting good jobs than those in 80% of areas in England., Brent said its good schools enabled equality of opportunity. “The other secret to our success is that we know that diversity is our greatest strength, so we proudly celebrate it,” said its deputy council leader, Margaret McLennan., Stockton-on-Tees said it accepted it had problems, but the study did not reflect the area’s many strengths. “We’re the economic powerhouse of the Tees Valley, contributing about a third of its economic output, and we’re home to internationally recognised brands,” said Bob Cook, leader of the council. “But we do, of course, have our challenges. We have significant areas of deprivation and serious health inequalities.”, He added that the area’s energy-intensive industries were meeting government emissions targets, and its weekly bin collections were popular with residents.salford greenest city bristol brighton england wales", "label": 0}, "train-499": {"text": "\nHow the world's fattest parrot came back from the brink\n, \nHow the world's fattest parrot came back from the brink\n, New Zealand’s kākāpō has long been endangered, but when a deadly fungal disease struck the country’s vets came to the rescue, Kate Evans, \n\nSat 14 Mar 2020 07.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 16 Mar 2020 07.07 EDT\n\n, Growing up in the north of England, Dr James Chatterton was enthralled by the books of the pioneering zookeeper and conservationist Gerald Durrell and dreamed of saving endangered species. Now, on the other side of the world, Chatterton has done just that, helping to bring the world’s fattest parrot back from the brink., Chatterton and his team spent the best part of a year bringing in quarantine conditions and trialling new treatments on the frontline of a killer disease afflicting New Zealand’s kākāpō., “I think most people think our job is to go and stroke the red panda, and cuddle the kākāpō,” says Chatterton, manager of veterinary services at Auckland Zoo’s New Zealand Centre for Conservation Medicine. Even in a normal year, the vet team’s work caring for the zoo’s animals and treating some of the country’s wild creatures is more serious than that, but 2019 was “monumental”, he says., The respiratory disease aspergillosis began to spread through the endangered kākāpō population last April, threatening to reverse the gains of the bird’s most successful breeding season in living memory., Kākāpo are not just rare, they are also deeply weird: flightless, nocturnal, with fragrant feathers and a comical waddling run. Males “boom” to attract females, and they only breed every three to six years when the native rimu trees “mast”, or produce large numbers of seeds. Last year was a “mega-mast”, the ripe fruit carpeting the ground, and the kākāpō responded by laying eggs earlier than ever before., By the end of the southern hemisphere’s summer in February, thanks to intensive intervention by New Zealand’s Department of Conservation (DOC) Kākāpō Recovery Programme, the population of 147 kākāpō had produced more than 80 chicks – a record number, given the seriously inbred species’ struggles with infertility., Auckland Zoo’s vets took turns working busy stints alongside conservation workers on the remote sanctuary islands where the birds live, in the country’s far south. By April, everyone was exhausted, but finally starting to relax., Then one of the chicks died suddenly. It was found to have aspergillosis, a brutal infection in which lumps of fungus form in the birds’ lungs and slowly choke them to death., “It’s hard to diagnose, extremely hard to treat, and usually fatal, particularly in wild birds. You usually just find them dead,” says Chatterton. The disease had only ever been seen in one kākāpō before. “We thought it was going to be a one-off.”, A few weeks later two more chicks died. Then two adult females became ill and had to be put down. “We thought: ‘Something very unusual is going on.’ You’re dealing with a lot of unknowns.”, With aspergillosis, by the time a wild bird begins to display symptoms – or anything unusual shows up in blood tests – it is usually too late to save them. The only way to diagnose the disease in time is using a CT scan or endoscopy to spot fungal growths in the lungs., The vets and DOC scientists began mapping which kākāpō had shared a nest with the sick birds and which had been on the same food run. The 12 deemed at highest risk were evacuated from their home, Codfish Island/Whenua Hou, and taken by helicopter to Auckland., Unfortunately, the city’s veterinary CT scanner was being replaced and was out of action for a crucial five weeks, so the vets took the kākāpō to one of the city’s human hospitals. Though they appeared completely healthy, all 12 were found to have lesions on their lungs., That was a stomach-dropping moment, says kākāpō scientist Andrew Digby, who was based on Whenua Hou at the time. “We were beginning to think it could possibly have affected the whole island … When you’re working with a threatened species, that’s always the biggest fear. They could go extinct at any point. We could lose half the population quite easily in a disease outbreak and set the programme back decades.”, Aspergillosis can be treated with oral anti-fungal drugs if you catch it early enough. “It’s worked really well with other parrots, but each new species you try needs a different dose,” says Chatterton. “We had birds dying, so we went with a high dose, but worried that in saving some we might kill some.”, To get the drugs into the birds’ air sacs, the vets also needed to use a nebuliser. Kākāpō may be the world’s fattest parrot, but their airways are still too small for the droplets produced by an adult human nebuliser, so Chatterton tried a paediatric one. It worked – but New Zealand is a small country, and initially only two were available., Meanwhile, more at-risk birds were being flown in from the island., “We peaked at 19 birds in the hospital, each being nebulised for 30 minutes, twice a day, with only two nebulisers. We had to do weekly bloods to make sure we weren’t killing them with liver damage from the drugs, and we had 19 birds that needed feeding twice a day and cleaning.”, Volunteer vets arrived to help from around the world. Extra pens were built to house the birds. People brought in sheets and duvets from home to cover the floors, and these had to be washed every day. Others went to the city’s regional parks to gather armfuls of the native plants kākāpō like to eat. Chatterton worked every day for five weeks., By September, 51 kākāpō had been evacuated and scanned – nearly a quarter of the entire population. Of 21 infected birds, aspergillosis had taken nine – though most of the deaths occurred before the anti-fungal treatments started., Many birds needed months of daily care, but the outbreak was contained. Chicks became juveniles, and while a few died from other causes, most survived and are now counted in the population number: 211, up from just 123 when Chatterton arrived in New Zealand seven years ago., It is a much happier ending than anyone was expecting. Digby and Chatterton put the team’s success down to the close attention paid to the kākāpō during the breeding season, the detailed records kept about each bird’s movements, and the connections forged between scientists and vets over the past two breeding seasons., “The only chance these endangered species have is if we all work together,” Chatterton says., Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresworlds fattest parrot comeback from extinction aoe", "label": 0}, "train-500": {"text": "\n'I can't get above water': how America's chicken giant Perdue controls farmers\n, Corporate control is a curse for farmers like Rudy Howell who are burdened with debt and have no alternative buyers, \nMichael Sainato, \n\nSat 14 Mar 2020 04.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 16 Mar 2020 04.32 EDT\n\n, Back in the 1990s, Rudy Howell, then in his mid-50s, took over his father-in-law’s poultry contract business in North Carolina. He and his wife hoped it would provide a decent income they could combine with their small pensions to fund a comfortable retirement., Instead, Howell, now 70, finds himself working long hours, deep in debt and earning less than $40,000 (£30,654) in 2019 – well below the average US wage. He spoke to the Guardian about his situation. “It doesn’t matter what I do, I can’t get above water. I do the same thing every time and the payout per flock can vary by as much as $8,000. Our output depends on their input.”Like nearly 90% of  US poultry producers Howell is not an independent farmer who can buy and sell his chickens to whoever he wants. He is contracted exclusively to Perdue Farms, one of the largest poultry companies in the US. The company, which produces a number of other agricultural products and services, generates more than $6bn a year in revenue., Over the past half century poultry farming in the US has become increasingly consolidated among a handful of companies. Tyson Foods, Pilgrim’s Pride, Sanderson Farms, Koch Foods and Perdue control about 60% of the US chicken market. The companies own and operate all the means of production, including the feed mills, slaughterhouses, trucking lines and even the hatcheries that develop the best strains of chickens.In the 1960s, poultry companies experimented with owning and operating chicken farms, but realised it was the least profitable, highest risk part of the supply chain. Instead they moved to the current system, persuading independent contracted farmers to take on this responsibility instead, and the system has reaped rich profits for those at the top. From 1981 to 2018, farm sales of chickens increased from $4.5bn  to $31.7bn., But contracts typically hand a remarkable amount of control to the parent company. In this case, Perdue maintains ownership of the birds, and the contract stipulates that farmers can only use feed, medication, vaccinations and other supplies provided by or arranged by Perdue. The contract also grants Perdue the authority to determine the breed of chickens produced, the numbers in each flock, the time allowed for processing each flock, and placement for future flocks., Howell and his fellow poultry farmers are so far from independent that in March 2018 the small business administration office of the Inspector General issued a report stating that most poultry farmers do not qualify as independent businesses eligible for loans from the agency because integrators exert so much control over them. “This control overcame practically all of a grower’s ability to operate their business independent of integrator mandates,” it concluded., “They Perdue call themselves a family farm, but they’re a corporate farm. They have control over everything out here,” said Howell., It’s a system that has been criticised by farm support groups, because it prevents farmers from changing poultry producer or leaving the business due to the amount of debt accrued to get started and maintain the business. The average estimated debt required to build one chicken house is $300,000, with farms usually containing at least four. The bank debts immediately lock producers into depending on their contract to meet repayments. Howell says he is also mandated to take on farm upgrades as required by the company., “It’s a combination of long-term debt through a contract and a very high cost of exit. For the company, it’s a short-term commitment. The farmers are at a huge disadvantage,” said Scott Marlow, senior policy specialist at the Rural Advancement Foundation International-USA. “By the time the farmer pays initial debt, they have to buy new equipment so they never get out of debt, never get to the point where they’re not in significant debt.”Howell has little alternative but to stick with Perdue. In Robeson County, North Carolina, where he farms, there is only one other company, Mountaire Farms, to do business with, but the changes it would require to meet different standards would demand a massive amount of starter debt., Perdue told the Guardian that Sanderson Farms and Pilgrim Farms also operate in the area. In fact, as far as we could discover, Sanderson Farms only operates hatcheries and a processing plant, not chicken houses. Pilgrim Farms told the Guardian it does not operate any houses in the county., Today, the handful of companies controlling 90%  of the poultry market in the US are currently under federal investigation over allegations they coordinated to fix prices. This price fixing makes it nearly impossible for individual farmers to survive independently without a niche or speciality market. Perdue declined to comment on the pending litigation.Developing a niche market and trying to compete with Perdue is virtually impossible, says Craig Watts, a former contract grower with the company. “There’s a sense of hopelessness among farmers. Half a million dollars worth of debt makes a man very agreeable so they’re not going to rock the boat too much. Most people hang on and continue,” he said., Half a million dollars worth of debt makes a man very agreeable. They’re not going to rock the boat too much, Howell says he gets paid .052 cents per pound of chicken, with deductions or bonuses decided by a so-called tournament system covering every other farmer in the area. Farmers who produce the most amount of weight with the least amount of feed receive the bonuses on top of base pay, while less efficient farmers have money deducted.Howell claims he is charged with the responsibility and costs of incinerating unusable birds in flocks provided by Perdue, but isn’t compensated for the birds sent to him in poor condition. “They send us bad low quality feed out here, you get bad birds, they send us bad birds, we’re going to get bad birds. In the past year, they’ve been sending a lot of culls, little birds you can’t do anything with and have to kill them.”, While a number of contract broiler growers are reporting incomes substantially higher than average farm incomes, the  United States Department of Agriculture has said growers’ income can vary widely with some reporting earnings as low as $18,782., A South Carolina poultry grower also supplying Perdue, who asked to remain anonymous, made a similar claim: “You’re penalised if you don’t perform and it’s not your fault. You listen to your flock supervisor throughout and then do poorly. Why am I at fault if I do everything they want me to do?”, “On average, we have to kill 6-8,000 chickens per flock because they’re not growing, but we don’t get compensated for it. We shouldn’t have to pay for birds that are given to us sick and it’s been getting worse over the past year,” he added., In response, a Perdue spokesperson told the Guardian: “Culls and livability varies from farm to farm. Birds that are well cared for will generally have a higher livability and that has a lot to do with the management style on the farm. As part of our animal care initiative, we have put a lot of emphasis on identifying birds that are in pain or can’t get to feed and water, and taking the proper measures. It is the right thing to do.”The spokesperson added: “Our poultry farming contracts are designed to help insulate farmers from most of the financial risks associated with raising chickens and turkeys – including volatile markets – while providing year-round farm income and rewarding top performance.”i cant get above water how americas chicken giant perdue controls farmers", "label": 0}, "train-501": {"text": "\nOn the verge: a quiet roadside revolution is boosting wildflowers\n, On the verge: a quiet roadside revolution is boosting wildflowers, Projects to reduce grass cutting and increase the diversity of plants and wildlife along Britain’s roads are having dramatic results, by  Patrick Greenfield, \n\nSat 14 Mar 2020 04.00 EDT\n\n, In 2014, Giles Nicholson was battling the growing year from hell. A mild winter followed by a warm, wet spring had turbocharged a ferocious mass of cow parsley, nettles and dense grass along the hundreds of miles of road his team maintains for Dorset council. Austerity meant there was barely enough money to pay for repeated cuttings to hold back the matted swards. Complaints poured in about messy roadsides., “The machinery wouldn’t go through it,” says Nicholson, recalling the overspilling verges., But the chaos of that summer would prove an unlikely turning point for wildflowers and biodiversity in the English county. Vast stretches of roadside have been transformed. Where there were thick clumps of grass, there are low-growing wildflowers such as black medic, birds-foot trefoil and red clover. The verges are cut two or three times a year, not 12, saving the council tens of thousands of pounds. Butterflies and other invertebrates have returned in their droves., The reasons behind this unlikely mini-revolution for biodiversity are simple. When the worst of the 2014 growing season was over, ecologist Philip Sterling was brought in to oversee the council’s service team. He and Nicholson, Dorset council’s countryside and greenspace manager, set about applying the centuries-old principles of hay making to the management of verges, cul-de-sacs and urban grass patches across the county. It is a practice that has now been adopted by other counties in the UK, including in Lincolnshire., In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing. Photograph: Eva Worobiec/Alamy, The process is simple: cut infrequently, ideally, just twice a year in spring and then late summer once plants have bloomed and seeded; remove the clippings to gradually reduce the fertility of the soil and prevent a buildup of mulch; repeat, wait, and enjoy the resurgent wildlife and flowers., “It will not fail,” says Sterling, who, as programme manager for charity Butterfly Conservation’s building sites for butterflies project, has taken his roadside revolution around the country to any local authority that will listen. “As fertility declines in a soil, biodiversity increases. At first that seems a little counterintuitive because you imagine the more you pour into a soil, the more plants that can grow. That’s not how it works in the natural system. In more fertile systems, a few species dominate and they swamp and smother everything else.”, Wildflowers on roadsides are a haven for butterflies and insects. Photograph: Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, Grass cuttings are almost always left where they fall along the thousands of miles of road verges that are maintained by law in the UK. Over time, the resulting mulch increases the fertility of the soil, meaning the grass grows with increasing vigour and needs to be cut more frequently. The cut and collect method breaks the cycle., The before and after photos of otherwise ordinary roadsides across Dorset show the dramatic effects of Nicholson and Sterling’s maintenance regime, as suffocated seed banks have been allowed to spring back into life. Yarrow and yellow flashes of lady’s bedstraw punctuate roadsides and roundabouts throughout summer. Magenta pyramidal orchids linger outside a branch of Tesco., The cost savings of managing roadsides this way are equally stunning for the council’s accounting department. The annual budget for highway verge management dropped from nearly £1m to £650k in five years under the cut and collect, low fertility approach. London boroughs, councils from across the country and European governments are paying attention., “For the last 40 years we’ve been doing entirely the wrong thing,” says Sterling, impatient with the possibilities for roadsides across the UK and beyond., Wildflower meadows, ancient British ecosystems that are crucial for wildlife, thrived for centuries with the help of traditional farming methods and livestock husbandry, but have largely vanished in the post-war era. Industrialised use of nitrogen fertilisers and poor land management have diminished the crucial wildlife habitat by 97% since the 1930s. But road verges have become an unlikely source of hope., Last September, the wildlife charity Plantlife produced new guidelines for transforming the management of the UK’s roadsides that incorporate some of Nicholson and Sterling’s practices. Crucially, the plan to turn verges into wildlife corridors is also backed by the country’s highways authorities and construction and services businesses such as Kier and Skanska., If adopted nationwide, an area the size of Nottinghamshire could see 700 species of wildflowers thriving along the road network in Great Britain, equivalent to around 40% of the government’s land restoration targets for 2040. A petition backing Plantlife’s campaign has more than 85,000 signatures., Botanical surveyors inspect roadside verges in Lincolnshire. Photograph: Matthew Roberts/Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, “It’s about bringing colour back to the countryside and to our roadsides. If we have that colour there, then we’ll have lots of other wildlife there as well,” says Plantlife botanist Trevor Dines., “Plants are the powerhouses of our food chains. They are the only things that are collecting energy from the sun and pumping it into the food chain. Without that diversity of plants there, you don’t get the diversity of other wildlife,” he adds., One 4.5-mile stretch in Dorset shows what is possible: the Weymouth relief road. Opened in 2011 ahead of sailing events at the Olympics, the seven hectares (17 acres) of verges that line one of the busiest roads in the county have become a crucial site for biodiversity., Yellow clusters of kidney vetch, the only wildflower where the small blue, Britain’s smallest butterfly, will lay its eggs, dominate the roadsides in the spring and summer. But the medicinal pea-like flowers, whose seeds can cost more than £2,000 a kilo from commercial providers, are not an extravagant token of the region’s Olympic legacy., “I harvested the seeds for that myself,” says Sterling, recounting the painstaking task of growing enough kidney vetch at recycling centres and flood bunds since the early 90s. “Now look how much there is.” , Since the road opened, more than half of the species of butterfly known to inhabit Britain have been recorded on the grasslands lining the road, including the Adonis blue and Chalkhill blue. Sterling has 10kg of of kidney vetch seed ready in his office for when the Stonehenge tunnel gets approval ., A Holly blue butterfly rests on a yellow kidney vetch. Photograph: MusicalJoe/Getty Images/iStockphoto, “If you think about the species of butterfly that Weymouth relief road supports on seven hectares, what would it be like on a hundred hectares?” says Nicholson excitedly., “There’s a huge opportunity here in the UK to change what we’ve currently got,” says Sterling. “We can put back much of what we’ve lost. It’s not impossible to do. We haven’t gone beyond that tipping point where there is so little left that there’s no point., “If half the species of butterfly in the UK can turn up on a road verge created less than 10 years ago, then we do have the capabilities to do this, don’t we?”, But such enthusiasm for Britain’s wildflowers are not apparent everywhere. Opposite a burger van in a ditch near Ely lies one of England’s rarest plants, the only known native fenland ragwort plant., The critically endangered wildflower, which is supposedly protected by being on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is surrounded by faded McDonald’s packaging and beer tins. The plant was only discovered when a French botanist from a nearby Cambridge research centre identified it while relieving himself in a layby in the 1960s, so the story goes., “It was the first sighting of fen ragwort since the mid to late 19th century, so getting on for 100 years, more or less,” says Tim Pankhurst, Plantlife’s conservation manager for the east of England, as lorries storm pass on the road that links Ely and Newmarket., “That’s it for fen ragwort. This is the sole native site in Britain. A lonely roadside ditch at the back of a verge near Ely.”, The tall plant is a relic of how the fens, in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk, used to be: a vast expanse of marshland full of native birds and wildlife. Fen ragwort would have been torn up and moved around by flood waters, but since the region was drained in the 18th century, there’s now only one known native site., Grass needs to be three to four inches long for flowers such as clovers, daisies, selfheal and creeping buttercup to thrive. Prof Jane Memmott, president of the British Ecological Society, says we should drop our obsession with keeping everything tidy. “I think bohemian untidiness is what we’re aiming for – you don’t want it to look like neglect.\" If gardeners can't wave goodbye to their manicured lawn, Buglife recommends leaving a strip of long grass and mowing it just once in autumn and spring., Dandelions are a crucial source of food for early pollinators such as solitary bees, honey bees and hoverflies. Each dandelion head contains up to 100 individual flowers, known as florets, which contain large amounts of nectar and pollen., Old English roses and dahlias might look beautiful but they focus much of their energy on producing petals, leaving little nectar for insects. A good test to find out if a flower is insect-friendly is to see whether you can see the pollen and nectar parts without pulling the petals back. If they are visible, it’s probably ok for pollinators, Memmott says., The trend for artificial lawns threatens valuable habitats for a wide range of butterflies, bees and birds. Research from 2011 found that 7,423 acres of the UK’s garden space had been lost over eight years and nearly all of this loss was down to people putting decking, concrete or artificial grass over their gardens. , Phoebe Weston, Restoring wildflower meadows in the agricultural heartlands of the UK by creating a network of wildlife corridors has become a particular focus for conservationists. The widest road verges in the country are in East Anglia, on the former drovers’ roads once used to transport livestock to London and other major cities. Small stretches in Lincolnshire have been managed as roadside nature reserves since the 1960s., Seated around a table in a rural pub near Spalding in Lincolnshire is an unlikely trio of wildflower revolutionaries taking Plantlife’s maintenance guidelines one step further. Derek Scott, an agricultural equipment manufacturer, Henry Dymoke, a local farmer and landowner, and Mark Schofield, a conservation officer at Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, have developed a machine that could spread the cut and collect method around the country., Scott’s company manufactures industry-standard machinery for vegetable washing, which is exported to every major agricultural economy. In 2018, Schofield convinced him to apply his engineering prowess to a pioneering tender by Lincolnshire County Council to create machinery that would allow the local authority to use the cut and collect method on hundreds of miles of road in the county., Crucially, the machinery had to be able to deliver the cuttings to an anaerobic digestion plant that could convert the grass into biogas, which is found at Dymoke’s farm, Scrivelsby Estate., The Vergenair 5.5 verge harvesting system is a JCB tractor, an Italian suction flail and a Larrington trailer. The bespoke machinery trundles along the roadsides, cutting the grass and sucking it into the trailer which can take up to 10,000kg to the anaerobic digestion plant., “We’re replacing a natural process. We see fossil records of the auroch, the ancestor of the modern-day cow in cave paintings. Predators would drive them on from place to place, they’d have routes to get to water and they’d be moving from one bit of grazing to another bit of grazing,” says Schofield., A suction flail is used to cut grass verges in Lincolnshire. Photograph: Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust , “Hay cutting is our replacement for the wild auroch, the tarpan, the horse, the red deer. You can’t unleash the auroch on the A158 but you can have an artificial beast that’s a lot more manageable.”, The contraption allows the council to use the cut and collect, low fertility method across Lincolnshire and could go nationwide. But the project has come to an abrupt halt. The Environment Agency (EA) did not renew the permit for Lincolnshire to continue the trial due to concerns about waste codes and regulations., Because roadside verges are not being managed as a crop, they are formally classified as waste. To continue the project, Dymoke would have to purchase expensive new permits from the EA and invest thousands of pounds in upgrades to the anaerobic digestion plants., For now, Dorset and Lincolnshire lead an increasing number of councils in the quest to turn UK roadsides into the backbone of a nature recovery network where native plants and wildlife are free to re-emerge., Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featureson the verge a quiet roadside revolution is boosting wildflowers aoe", "label": 0}, "train-502": {"text": "\nCountry diary: long-tailed tits swirl high like leaves\n, Harlech, Gwynedd: They rank by weight as the tiniest of British birds, though that disproportionate tail gives a slightly false impression of their size, \nJim Perrin, \n\nSat 14 Mar 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n, Heading down through fields towards oak, ash and hazel copses along the Afon Artro, past impenetrable ramparts of gorse, I heard a familiar, delicate song. “A prolonged trill, low and aërial” is how WH Hudson, the most scrupulously observant of all avian writers, describes it. I scarcely needed to look around before an eccentrically scattering quiver of exquisite small birds hurled past me to settle momentarily and search for insects among bare, dark-budded twigs of the ash trees. A moment later, and as though at a signal, the acrobatic throng swirled high like leaves on an eddying wind and was gone., Long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus). “Bum-barrels” as John Clare knew them. I’m never sure whether that term applied to the birds themselves or more properly to the artistic masterpieces that are their nests. They are utterly endearing little creatures. Along with the goldcrest, they rank by weight as the tiniest of British birds (though that disproportionate tail gives a slightly false impression of their real size, as does the fluffiness of their pastel-tinged plumage). Their relationship to other tits is not close (larks, warblers and swallows also belong to the same large family). But their behaviour – the communal groups, the incessant activity – is distinctly tit-like., Those fist-sized, barrel-shaped nests are marvellous creations. It speaks volumes for Clare’s attentiveness to the natural world that he was well acquainted with them. Occasionally you see them high in the fork of a tree, but more often they’re concealed well within the densest thickets of gorse or blackthorn. They are constructed from moss, wool and feathers, decorated with scales of lichen, and bound together with gossamer., To see one with eight or 10 gaping maws clamouring for food at the entrance is one of the most pleasing and intimate sights in nature, and one of the hardest to locate. You need to study their comings and goings in May or June, then find a good angle to train your glass on the thicket to which they’re bound.

But the rodent is in the sights of another predator – a mammoth drone carrying hundreds of kilograms of deadly poison., This scene could soon be playing out across New Zealand’s most rugged wilderness as the Department of Conservation (DoC) considers a new high-tech strategy to halt the country’s biodiversity crisis., A drone, which is seven metres long and looks like a mini-helicopter, is being developed to wipe out pests in areas that humans simply can’t access due to steep cliffs, deep ravines and impenetrable vegetation., Conservation rangers usually hike into remote spots to lay bait stations and traps to kill stoats, rats and possums; invasive species the government has vowed to eradicate from the whole country by 2050., For hard to reach parts of the wilderness, manned helicopters have been extensively used by DoC, but the department is now investigating cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives in an increasingly climate-aware age., By the hour, drones are two-thirds cheaper than helicopters, and emit 85% less carbon, drone manufacturers say – a priority for a left-leaning government that has committed to being carbon neutral by 2050., Drones are more precise than helicopters, and are able to drop their bait loads within centimetres of the target, an important consideration when accidental poisonings of endangered native species are still occurring., “Restoring nature so indigenous species can thrive requires new tools and technologies,” minister of conservation Eugenie Sage said. “Drones have the potential to be a game-changer.”, Brent Beaven, head of the Predator Free 2050 programme at DoC, said more than 1 million hectares of land was being targeted for pest eradication “so there’s plenty of New Zealand” for the drones to deal with., “We are in a changing world, we can use helicopters for a lot of stuff, but our carbon footprint needs to track towards zero, we need to be looking at other options,” Beaven said. “My dream is that one day we’ll have artificial intelligence devices that will detect the presence of a pest somewhere that will automatically link to a messaging service that will send a drone out – wouldn’t that be great?”, Beaven said after three years of exterminating pests on 117 offshore islands the next phase of the project was “science”., A sum of NZ$790,000 (£390,000) has been awarded to Kiwi startup Environment &amp; Conservation Technologies (ECT) to engineer drone technology designed to withstand the unique challenges of the New Zealand bush, which include harsh sub-alpine environments and violent, unpredictable weather., ECT has undertaken similar pest eradication programmes using drones in the Pacific and the Galapagos islands., In the Galapagos, an infestation of black and brown rats was threatening the survival of the vulnerable, ground-dwelling bird population, and two drones were deployed by ECT to drop 1.5 tonnes of bait over 184 hectares in two days., The South American regional director of Island Conservation, Karl Campbell, who worked alongside ECT said drones saved the conservation group hundreds of thousands of dollars, and were far quicker and less invasive than traditional pest eradication measures. Helicopters were previously used., “The use of drones is more precise; it also increases feasibility, and reduces eradication costs of invasive rodents in small and mid-size islands worldwide,” Campbell said., The successful eradication of the rat invasion on the Galapagos is thought to be a world first., Using knowledge gained in the Galapagos project, Sam Vye of ECT said the potential for drones in the conservation arena was “exciting”; though he ruled out weaponising the machines for armed pest extermination from the sky., “New Zealand’s environment has extreme terrain and vegetation type and can be extremely dangerous for people on the ground to lay bait stations,” Vye said. “Using a drone we can actually fly in slightly more dangerous conditions than a manned helicopter, including to remote islands which are expensive for helicopters to get to. Compared to a manned helicopter, it also comes down to the precision and the placement of baits.”, The drone being developed for use in the New Zealand back country will be able to carry up to 170kg of bait. It requires only a drone pilot on the ground and an office worker to control it., So far the government has totally eradicated introduced pests from 117 offshore islands, and is now focusing its attention on the mainland., The drone trial will run over the next two years and involve three phased stages of testing.poison laden drones to patrol new zealand wilderness hunt pests aoe", "label": 0}, "train-504": {"text": "\nHow wildlife found sanctuary on our unwanted scraps of land\n, \nHow wildlife found sanctuary on our unwanted scraps of land\n, In this extract from his new book, the naturalist and broadcaster Stephen Moss visits sites around Britain that have become accidental, but vital, nature reserves, \nStephen Moss, \n\nSun 15 Mar 2020 07.01 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 25 Mar 2020 14.19 EDT\n\n, Wherever you go in Britain – in city, town or country – you can come across a hidden wildlife haven. It may be home to sand lizards and stoats, adders and orchids, butterflies and bush-crickets, water voles, peregrine falcons, or great crested grebes., Yet often these oases are not official nature reserves, but little scraps of land we rarely consider important for nature. Churchyards, roadside verges, railway cuttings and disused quarries may not appear to have much in common. But they were all originally created for humans’ needs, before becoming places where wild creatures thrive. Together, they add up to an area larger than all our official nature reserves combined., Not that these spots are unimportant to people. Often on the edge of urban areas, they are accessible to more people than rural nature reserves – especially to those who, by an accident of birth, background or geography, do not have access to “real” countryside., These places also matter for another, even more urgent reason. Since the second world war, a continuous drive towards more intensive farming has turned much of our countryside into a wildlife-free zone., That’s where the sites featured in this book come in. They provide a much-needed refuge for otherwise scarce species. Without them, some of our most vulnerable wild creatures would already have disappeared., I don’t need to tell you that Britain’s wildlife is under threat. Loss of habitat, pollution, persecution and, above all, the global climate emergency, mean that even our once common and widespread species are now struggling., So, at the start of this make-or-break century, as our wildlife enters one of the most challenging periods in its history, I have travelled round the country to visit these unheralded sanctuaries. Without them, nature in modern Britain might not be able to survive at all. , My taxi driver looked puzzled. ‘No, fella – there’s nothing down there except an industrial estate. I’ve never even heard of the “Window on Wildlife”!’ Fortunately, Google Maps came to our aid, and we headed through the rush-hour traffic towards Belfast docks., Twenty minutes later, we arrived outside “WoW” – the RSPB’s Window on Wildlife. The first thing that struck me was the strident calls of black-headed gulls, floating en masse over the lagoon before drifting down to land on artificial nesting rafts. They were accompanied by more delicate, wraith-like birds – common and Arctic terns – and dozens of black-tailed godwits, feeding voraciously., During the 1960s, when the port was being regularly dredged to permit the passage of large ships, the mud was dumped into three large pools. The plan was that eventually the mud would settle, and the land could then be reclaimed for building. But nature had other ideas. The fertile combination of water and mud created the ideal habitat for waterbirds such as ducks and waders, and they came here to feed in their thousands., Gradually, it became clear that the area was a real hotspot for birds: not just migrants and winter visitors, but breeding species too. Local people began lobbying to save this precious place from development. After long negotiations with the port authorities, the middle of the three lagoons was set aside for wildlife., Back at the visitor centre I had a chat with two regular volunteers, Ken and Phyllis. Ken reflected on the irony that somewhere that looks so natural is entirely created by humans, while Phyllis had noticed that, as the nearby industrial estate and business park grows, more and more workers are dropping in, lured by the sign outside., Belfast WoW is, to be honest, a bit out of the way to attract casual passers-by, as my taxi driver confirmed. But that’s all the more reason why places like this need championing. Phyllis told me she loves the reaction from visitors when they enter the observation area for the first time. ‘They just say, “Wow!”’, The southern migrant hawker is one of the most attractive of all our two dozen dragonfly species, and not only because it is so rare. The male is a dazzling cerulean shade, each azure segment interspersed with jet black. Close up, through my zoom lens, I could see the pale blue eyes and the lattice-like wings, laced with tiny shards of gold., This was just one of the amazing insects I saw on a recent visit to Canvey Wick, Britain’s first “brownfield” nature reserve. It is also home to a plethora of birds such as the whitethroat and stonechat as well as reptiles including adders and common lizards. In the early 1970s, this site was earmarked for an oil refinery, but the oil crisis led to the cancellation of the entire project. Afterwards, it was simply allowed to return to the wild., Had someone wanted to design a nature reserve for insects, they could hardly have done better – yet Canvey Wick is perhaps the most genuinely accidental habitat in this book. The poor, sandy soils only allow vegetation to grow slowly, so the wildflowers and grasses are not swamped as they might be elsewhere. And the large, circular stands of asphalt where the oil tanks would have stood built retain heat, creating a microclimate ideal for continental, warmth-loving species such as the shrill carder bee. Then there is the location: Canvey Island is one of the sunniest, warmest and driest places in the whole of the UK., Canvey Wick has been described as “England’s rainforest”, but as the Guardian’s wildlife writer Patrick Barkham pointed out, “England’s savannah” is a better description, given the absence of large trees. Like so many other wildlife-rich sites I have visited, it is a mosaic of mini-habitats: birch and willow scrub, brambles, dry and damp reedbeds, long grass and earth banks, which between them create exactly the right mix of ecological niches., Canvey Wick may not look special, but for invertebrate life it rivals well-known nature reserves such as Minsmere, Wicken Fen and Dungeness. As ecologist Dr Sarah Henshall notes, its unusual history gives it a special place in our natural heritage: “Canvey Wick is wild, it’s different, it’s rough around the edges. Wildlife thrives in the untidy messiness – that’s what makes the site unique.”, I am reminded of my childhood, when I played for hours in places like this. Canvey Wick is the clearest possible evidence why the label “brownfield site” is so unhelpful – indeed positively detrimental. To those who care about Britain’s wildlife, it’s these messy corners that need to be prioritised, not the green swathes of agri-desert that make up so much of our lowland countryside., In May 1974, I cycled from my home to the village of Datchet, where the Queen Mother Reservoir was being built. I walked slowly through the heat-haze towards a distant strip of water, where a slim bird took off a few yards in front of me, giving a persistent, high-pitched whistle I now know was a sign of alarm., I lifted my binoculars to see a small, long-winged wader circling low over the gravel. When it landed, I could see the plain, brownish back, black mask and, most importantly, a thin, lemon-yellow eye-ring: my first ever little ringed plover., This was a classic example of a species adapting to an “analogue habitat”. On the continent, little ringed plovers nest on the shingle banks of rivers, swept clean of vegetation by winter floods. The bare shingle allows them to disguise their eggs, especially from aerial predators such as kestrels. Gravel pits and reservoirs provided an ideal substitute for riverbanks, and during the post-war years they allowed the little ringed plover to gain a foothold this side of the Channel., About this time, I came across Adventure Lit Their Star, by Kenneth Allsop. The name will be familiar to readers of a certain age, for Allsop was a familiar face on TV during the 1960s. This was a Boys’ Own adventure story, in which an airman recovering from tuberculosis joins forces with two young lads to foil attempts by an egg-collector to steal a precious clutch of little ringed plovers’ eggs. The message is that birds need to be protected and welcomed and, more importantly, that nature can offer a form of therapy. This was something Allsop, who had lost a leg in the war and suffered periodic bouts of depression, understood only too well., Little ringed plovers went against expectations to breed in what Allsop described as “the messy limbo that is neither town nor country”. As a definition of the Accidental Countryside, this could hardly be bettered., It took me five minutes to walk round. At the edge of the peat diggings a few miles from Glastonbury I saw 10 birds, of just four species. And yet, apart from the five loitering mallards, the others confirmed these changing times., The first bird was a little egret. I am old enough to remember when one of these impossibly white birds made any birding trip a red-letter day. Even now, I still feel a jolt of pleasure whenever I see this little heron, which when I was growing up was still confined to the area around the Mediterranean., Moments later I saw a buzzard, another bird that wouldn’t have been here 20 years ago. Whereas the little egret extended its range northwards thanks to climate change and habitat restoration, the buzzard benefitted from an end to persecution by gamekeepers, enabling it to recolonise its former haunts., The next bird was one of my favourites: the green sandpiper. I half expected to see it here on this warm, early-August evening, as they drop in to feed on their journey south to Africa. For me, they are the first sign of autumn, despite appearing at the height of summer., The final pair of birds would once have been a very rare sight here. But there are now several dozen great white egrets on the Somerset Levels, and recently they have begun to visit my local patch., Birds like the great white, little and cattle egrets (another recent colonist), give the lie to the idea that all our wildlife is in decline. It’s not, but it wouldn’t take much to destroy these temporary, liminal habitats on which so many wild creatures depend., Before I left, I heard the piping call of that lone green sandpiper, and watched it rise into the sky. As it disappeared, I wished it good luck. It would need it, for just as places like this are being destroyed, so its stop-over points are also under threat, from wetlands being drained, or drying up because of climate change., One day, I fear, I will watch one disappear over the horizon, and that will be the last time I ever see a green sandpiper; not just here, but anywhere.

Might it save the world?, \nRyan Bradley, \n\nSun 15 Mar 2020 05.00 EDT\n\n, Ten years ago, James Rogers was driving through some of the most productive farmland on the planet, thinking about food. He had recently read an article detailing the challenges of feeding the world’s growing population, and as he gazed out over the fertile fields of the Salinas Valley outside Monterey, California, he thought: how is it possible that people go hungry, that people starve, when growing food seems so simple? “You just take these magic beans and...” Rogers, recalling the thought, casts his hand as if tossing seed on the ground. “I realise it’s a bit more complicated than that, but, still…”, Back then, Rogers was a PhD student in material sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He wasn’t working in anything food-related at all. His PhD research involved creating a kind of paint that, when dried, turned into a solar panel. There was a lab up in Berkeley that had the equipment necessary for his studies, but between the lab and his home in Santa Barbara, he passed the farmland, and the food problem gnawed at him. He wondered if it wasn’t merely as simple as he supposed. He began taking classes in environmental economics and natural resources. He learned that, globally, we are indeed producing more than enough food. The problem isn’t production, it’s what happens next., We waste an extraordinary amount of food. In America it’s about 40%; in the UK, nearly the same. Around the world, almost a third of all the food produced – approximately 1.3bn tonnes – is lost one way or another each year. Much of the time it’s not merely lost, but brought into our homes only to be chucked in the bin, and then transported to a landfill, where it slowly releases methane back into the atmosphere, actively warming the Earth. Worldwide, a staggering 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. The question for Rogers was: what exactly was driving so much waste?, One day, while researching, he came across another article. He can still recall its first line: “All fresh produce is seasonal as well as perishable.” That insight – so simple, so true – struck him like a lightning bolt. “The problem,” he recalls, “is you’re either in season and have more than you know what to do with, or you have nothing.” Plenty of animals have adapted to these natural cycles of boom and bust, fat times and lean: birds migrate, bears hibernate. Humans trade, converting this surplus into a non-perishable asset we call money. Some of the earliest forms of currency were, in fact, grains stored in clay pots. And clay pottery, Rogers is quick to point out, was one of material science’s very first breakthroughs. Clay pottery allowed us to continue eating long after the harvest. But clay pottery only got us so far. It was what material science might offer food today that interested him., He decided, then, to switch tracks. No longer would he work on paint that dried into solar panels. He would instead begin to work on increasing the shelf life of fruit and vegetables. Eventually, he developed a substance that wasn’t entirely dissimilar from the solar paint. This substance, however, was made entirely out of plant lipids, or fatty acids. Spray it on to an avocado, say, and the substance dries into a sort of second skin, which increases the avocado’s shelf life by two to three times., The company Rogers founded, Apeel Sciences, is currently growing by hundreds of employees a year, backed by tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and is revolutionising entire food systems and economies. But back then, in 2010, driving past those fertile fields, it was still early days. Rogers remembers calling his mother and telling her the news about his insight – the big switch in his interests and research. “Sweetie,” she said to him. “That sounds really nice. But you don’t know anything about fruit and vegetables.”, Apeel Sciences is headquartered in Goleta, California, just north of UCSB and south of farmland that quickly gives way to the rural, rolling Central California coast. The company’s 100,000 sq ft building was formerly home to a medical-device maker and the labs and clean rooms easily swapped from their previous purpose – building prototypes for entry into the human body – to their current one: the study of the molecular structures of fruit’s skin., “This room is part of our food-manufacturing practice,” says Molly Greathouse, who is giving me a tour. We peer in, but the lab is dark and empty and appears abandoned. “It’s still being set up,” she says. “We’re still putting wires into things.” Her colleague, Daniel Costanza, is my other guide. Both are recent hires, but recent is relative: Apeel’s employee count rose in the past six months from 130 to more than 200, so Greathouse, who has been here for nearly a year-and-a-half, counts as a seasoned veteran., 'This is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet', We pass another lab, a clean room that houses, among other bacteria, E coli and listeria. The lights are on, and along one wall is another big door topped by a glowing red light. Here, Greathouse says, is where Apeel’s scientists put fruit and vegetables through a battery of tests mimicking conditions they might face while in transit. What happens when refrigeration shuts down? What happens when a contaminated batch of food is nearby, hence the reason for the dangerous bacteria. There are cascading effects to prolonging the shelf life of produce., Costanza describes how one of the suppliers they work with no longer uses plastic wrap on cucumbers now that Apeel’s spray is in the mix. It’s a seemingly small change that quickly adds up. In a single year, that one move will save enough plastic wrap to enfold the Empire State Building 11 times over. “Imagine adding that to each food category throughout the globe,” Costanza says. “That’s a huge paradigm shift away from single-use plastics. It’s pretty crazy.” Costanza drops his voice, getting serious. “This is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet. There are so many lives we can affect in a positive way. And we have such tight intellectual property no one’s really able to replicate it – we don’t really have competition.”, They do, really. There’s Hazel Technologies, which is based in Chicago and makes little packets that get stashed in produce boxes. The packets alter the atmosphere within the box, slowing the food’s response to ethylene, a chemical that fruit and vegetables emit as they age that causes a breakdown in colour and texture. A similar company in the UK, called It’s Fresh, makes ethylene filters, too, and recently received a $10m investment from AgroFresh, a company that sells a dozen or so products including fungicides and wax coatings, all of which aim to prolong produce shelf life and enhance their look., There’s also Cambridge Crops, from Massachusetts, which makes a similar edible protective coating to Apeel, using silk proteins rather than plant lipids. Cambridge Crops received $4m in seed funding from the MIT venture fund last year, whereas Apeel recently landed $70m from the Silicon Valley fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has famously backed Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb and Soylent, the meal-replacement drink company., All of these companies and investors are making a play for a market worth at least $218bn in the US, and several times that worldwide. That number – $218bn – is about how much grocery stores, restaurants and people at home spend on food that simply gets thrown away per year, according to ReFed, a food waste-reduction nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. ReFed also estimates that, last year, venture capitalists invested about $185m in technologies to combat food waste., People have been trying to preserve fruit and vegetables for at least as long as they’ve been putting grains in clay pots. We dry it in the sun (12,000 BC) or jam it (600 AD) or cure it (1400 AD), or cool it or can it, pasteurise it or vacuum seal it. The practice of coating a fruit in wax to seal its freshness and enhance its appearance is at least several centuries old, and today you’d be hard pressed to find a supermarket apple without it. Today, wax seals also contain antifungal properties, which are perfectly safe, and are applied in so thin a layer as to be pretty much insignificant., What sets Apeel apart is its specific coating technology – the fact that it works more effectively than a wax and is an organic additive made from plant parts. That, and the company’s comparatively huge cash influx from Silicon Valley, and its truly global reach. Apeel is already well on its way to spanning the globe. It has satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey, and it works with five different suppliers of avocados, including Del Monte and Del Rey, which are two of the largest. It also works with Sage Fruit, one of Washington state’s largest organic apple growers., Greathouse and Costanza shepherd me past the analytical sciences lab, where the fruit is run through a series of taste and smell tests to make sure that the Apeel spray essentially disappears as soon as it’s applied. This is a complex task. The spray can be made of the lipids from any plant – much of the source crop for their ingredients changes throughout the year, and is simply the excess or discarded produce from farms and vineyards – but it has to be molecularly reconstituted to act more or less exactly like the specific fruit on which it is sprayed., We arrive at yet another lab, this one home to the material sciences team – the beating heart of the Apeel operation. Here, they use liquid gases to separate specific molecules from the lipid slurry, then reconfigure those molecules into a variety of combinations, essentially highly educated hunches as to what a specific fruit or vegetable’s skin might be like. If this seems like a lot of tedious guesswork, it is. The research and development for Apeel’s first product, a coating for avocados, took eight years., Now we’re in a bright room lined with racks of mouldering strawberries and bananas. Well, some are mouldering, some are not. Each rack has a camera mounted and set to a timer, to scan the fruit and track its breakdown. Some of the fruit has been sprayed with the Apeel spray, some has not. Tim, an engineer and overseer of the rotting fruit, apologises for the fruit fly situation in the room., Finally, our tour ends in a warehouse at the back of the building. The space is dominated by huge produce sorting and cleaning machines, rigged with a custom-made Apeel spray device that treats the fruit or vegetables at the very last step of the process., “It feels like moisturiser,” Greathouse says, describing the spray. It is odourless and tasteless, too. Once, when Greathouse tried some of it on her hand, she thought, “Maybe I can shave with this.” In fact, she adds, “The reason we wrinkle is oxidation and moisture loss – same as fruit. I want to do an experiment with one half of my face on Apeel, one half not, and then see what happens.”, James Rogers, the CEO, has an office filled with avocados. Some are pillows, some figurines, some are squishy stress balls shaped like avocados, some are the genuine article. Rogers loves avos. “The joke with the av is: not now, not now, not now. Now? Too late,” he says. But: “When you get an Apeel avocado the joke no longer makes sense,” because the fruit stays ripe for so long. The window to enjoy it, previously so fleeting, has been stretched by weeks. The one fruit he loves even more, though, is the strawberry. “I know it’s not sexy, but it’s just my favourite,” he says. “And they go bad so quickly.” The company is a few years into R&amp;D on that one. “When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that’s when I know we’ll have made it.”, These days, Rogers spends less time in material science and more on distribution chains. It turns out, when you create a new technology that extends the shelf life of produce, it creates another problem central to the whole business: who, exactly, does this create value for? The perishability of a fruit or veg dictates everything about its supply chain. Everything from when you pick it, right down to the season and the time of the day, to where it’s packed, in the field or a packing shed. Is it then force air-cooled, or hydro-cooled? Does it travel down a flume or a conveyor belt? Does it go in a bag? Or does it get boxed? Does it go in a box with big holes or small holes? Does it go into a shipping container? Does it go into an aeroplane? Does it go into a display in the grocery store? When it goes home with you, does it go in the fridge? Or does it go on your counter?, Within every supply chain for every different fruit or vegetable lies economic opportunity. The goal for each of Apeel’s produce lines, Rogers says, is that the savings accrued by the growers or grocers are so great that you and I are actually paying less for their fruit and vegetables in the market. This is crucial, because – yes – while it’s good for the environment and will cut down on waste, feeling good about what you buy can only rope in so many consumers; the rest, the real revolution, lies in sheer economic price cutting. A cheaper piece of fruit that will last four times as long? No one will pass that bargain up., Where things start to get truly interesting, from a market perspective, is how this opens up whole new avenues of produce to put in front of people. Just as perishability dictates everything about its supply chain, how well a fruit or vegetable travels is the most important characteristic of any mass-produced produce. The best example of this is the banana. Nearly every banana sold in supermarkets is a variety called the Cavendish. The Cavendish isn’t particularly tasty, as banana varieties go. Nor is it especially packed with nutrients. There are far better bananas out there. But none travel – stay firm and unripe quite as long – like the Cavendish. Only, the Cavendish is falling victim to its own success, and a fungus is rampaging through this particular variety. So diversity in our produce isn’t just a nice thing for us as eaters, it’s essential for our future food security., Just up the road from Apeel’s headquarters is a farm growing a strange kind of finger-shaped lime. When cut open, the flesh appears pearled, like caviar, which is why it’s known as a caviar lime. The farm’s caviar limes are a speciality item, trucked to high-end restaurants in LA and flown to New York for the same purpose. The limes last for 7-10 days after they’ve been picked. But Apeel started working with the farm a few years ago, and was able to develop a spray that worked. A fruit with a shorter window of ripeness actually speeds up the development process, because you are able to quickly see what’s working, and what’s not. Now this fruit that was so highly specialised, appearing for just one weekend in a farmer’s market, and in a few dishes in fancy restaurants, can be sold in supermarkets., The caviar limes weren’t Rogers’ idea. Some of his scientists became infatuated with the problem and went to work on it. But now, he sees how this might be the future: new fruit and heirloom vegetables: the weirder, more specialised, small-batch stuff, brought to the masses. The weird limes were actually the very first product Apeel brought to the market. “Thank God no one listened to me on that one,” he says, smiling, thinking back on it. It taught him another important lesson, one he carries forward now. “The shorter the shelf life, the bigger the opportunity.”a new way to extend the life and fruit and vegetables", "label": 0}, "train-506": {"text": "\n90 US cities and states suspend water shutoffs to tackle coronavirus pandemic\n, But just one in five water departments have agreed to reconnect household currently without running water, \nNina Lakhani in New York, \n\nMon 16 Mar 2020 05.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 14.03 EDT\n\n, Almost 90 cities and states across the US have suspended water shutoffs for residents unable to afford their bills, as local leaders scramble to tackle the complex public health threats posed by the coronavirus pandemic., There is no vaccine or treatment for coronavirus, also known as Covid-19. According to the World Health Organization, good hygiene, specifically frequent handwashing with soap, is crucial to prevent the virus spreading., The expanding list of public utilities ordering a moratorium on shutoffs means about 57 million Americans in cities including Cleveland, Memphis and San Diego will be protected from losing their water service during the pandemic., Seven states – Wisconsin, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Louisiana – have mandated a halt to shutoffs, according to data provided exclusively to the Guardian by Food &amp; Water Watch (FWW), a not-for-profit organisation tracking the situation., A handful of private water companies, which supply about 15% of Americans, have suspended shutoffs., But just one in five water departments have explicitly agreed to reconnect households currently without running water. The rest have only committed to halting new shutoffs., As a result, potentially hundreds of thousands of impoverished Americans will remain without running water during one of the worst public health crises in modern history., “Suspending water shutoffs is the right thing to do, but reconnecting every household in the country is essential during this emergency in which handwashing is a primary measure to stop the spread,” said Michigan congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, who last year co-sponsored legislation to tackle America’s water crisis., “Clean, safe, affordable water is a basic human need … it is unacceptable and inhumane to shut off people’s water because they can’t afford the bill,” Lawrence said., According to data collected by the New York Times, at least 2,800 people in 49 states, Puerto Rico and Washington DC had tested positive for Covid-19 by Sunday morning, with 59 confirmed deaths., The actual number of cases is almost certainly far higher given the country’s struggle to provide proper screening – one of multiple potentially catastrophic failures being blamed on the Trump administration’s haphazard handling of the pandemic., There is no national database tracking the number of US households without running water. But in 2016, one in every 20 households were disconnected by public water departments, leaving an estimated 15 million Americans without running water, according to research by FWW., The highest shutoffs rates were concentrated in southern or rural states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida and Oklahoma. The hardest-hit cities, such as New Orleans, Detroit and Jacksonville, have high poverty and unemployment rates and more people of color., Before the Covid-19 outbreak, only 10 US cities, among them New York, Flint and Baltimore, had banned water shutoffs., Mary Grant from FWW said: “We need an immediate outright nationwide ban on shutoffs, and must make sure that every household has running water in order to protect human health and our communities.”, It is unclear what proportion of the country’s half a million homeless people currently have access to running water., Last week, Detroit became the first city to announce a moratorium. It included the state covering the $25 reconnection fee for homes without water, and a reduced monthly bill for these households during the coronavirus outbreak., According to figures from the Detroit water and sewerage department (DWSD), 3,600 occupied homes (or houses with water usage in the previous 12 months) have been disconnected since April 2019. Of these, a staggering 2,800 were still without running water when the coronavirus reconnection plan was announced., In its first couple of days of implementation, only 73 families were reconnected – partly because DWSD crews had to spend time installing meters in some homes, according to a city spokesman. Residents are being advised to flush the water pipes before drinking in order to reduce the risk of lead poisoning., “The issue is broad, complex and bureaucratic but these numbers are unacceptable,” said Lawrence., Reconnections should speed up this week as three extra plumbers have been hired and the call centre, where residents must register for help, is beefing up capacity., At least 141,000 Detroit households have been disconnected since 2014 as part of a widely condemned debt-collection programme, according to records obtained by Bridge, a news magazine., One study found a significant increase in skin and waterborne gastrointestinal diseases among hospital patients in Detroit who lived on a block where at least one neighbour had been disconnected. The city claims most shutoffs are done in unoccupied houses to prevent flooding and other damage., “What’s happening now … this has been our greatest fear,” said Monica Lewis-Patrick, director of We the People of Detroit, a grassroots coalition and research collective., “It’s undeniable that access to clean water is for the public good.

We hear of damsons and a Victorian plum tree in bloom already in a Westmorland valley, but it is in a sheltered spot within a short distance of the coast; no doubt affected, like all that country is said to be, by the influence of the sea breezes passing over the “Gulf stream,” which strikes that part of the coast. On the fells only a few miles away, however, the snow is lying, and wintry weather is checking the too rapid advance of nature. And it is well so, for many fruit trees were getting too forward for safety., I notice that again this spring letters are appearing in defence of the starling as a bird that is a friend to the gardener and ought to he encouraged. I cannot imagine where the experience suggesting this statement can have been got. If ever a small flight of these birds visit your orchard when the pears are ripe they will not, as so many of our feathered friends, attack a pear and make an end of it, but they will set to work and peck a hole in one after another, till practically your crop is worthless – scarcely any left without blemish on the tree; and often, when the visiting flight has been large, as in recent years it sometimes has been, they have done serious mischief amongst the apples and other fruit. It is in this as in so many other cases: when you destroy the balance of nature by killing their natural enemies, their vast numbers cause them to be unable to live on their old foods and they become a pest.country diary starlings no friend to the gardener 1920", "label": 0}, "train-508": {"text": "2019 was bad year for floods and drought in England, say charities, Exclusive: conservation groups say weather extremes putting strain on resources and taking toll on wildlife, Last year was one of the worst in recent times for both flooding and drought in England, a study has found., There were more than 5,600 flood warnings in England in 2019, more than in any of the last 15 years except 2012. Groundwater levels were lower than normal in 25 areas, more than in any year since comparable records began in 2006., In 2012 there were only eight areas where groundwater levels were lower than normal. In 2014, another wet year, no areas recorded lower than normal levels., Having both very wet and very dry weather is unusual but is likely to become more common as weather becomes more extreme as a result of climate change. People may begin to experience both water shortages and flooding, putting infrastructure under unprecedented strain., Wildlife will also suffer, a group of conservation charities have said. They estimate that only 1% of current spending on flooding and drought goes to nature-based solutions such as restoring water meadows and wetlands, which can act like a sponge to store water under flooding and as natural reservoirs at times of drought., The charities are particularly concerned that staff cuts and stretched resources at the Environment Agency and Natural England and in local government and other government agencies charged with environmental protection mean years like 2019 will stretch England’s resilience to breaking point., Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “If funds for our water watchdogs dry up, the human and ecological effects of flooding and drought will grow every year. We need to get flood funds flowing to Natural England and the Environment Agency to ensure that good water management is part of the fabric of our landscape., “The government should devote new cash to the agencies for natural flood mitigation, urban resilience, habitat enhancement and sustainable farming, plus vital functions like regulatory enforcement and spatial planning.”, This year has had one of the wettest starts on record, with rainfall in February in many areas breaking records after Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis., Benwell said more heavy rainfall this spring would be likely to lead to further widespread flooding and damage to wildlife in waters and wetlands. This is due to exceptionally high river flows and groundwater levels, and soil saturation., But if this summer is hot and dry, as in the drought of 2018, rivers would quickly cease to flow again in parts of the country., Britain’s chalk streams, a natural habitat under increasing threat from extremes of weather, are likely to be among the worst-hit areas, said Ian Hepburn, of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust., “Exceptionally serious drought and floods created a perfect storm for our waters and wildlife last year, with our globally rare chalk streams particularly badly hit,” he said. “Climate change means that without radical action many more years of flood and drought crises lie ahead. We need substantial, consistent and urgent investment from the government in our water watchdogs and natural flood and drought defences or our rivers and lakes, and the wildlife that relies on them, will continue to deteriorate.”, In the budget, the chancellor of the exchequer pledged to double capital spending on floods, from £2.6bn to £5.2bn, which the government said would protect an additional 330,000 homes. However, the new spending will not take account of ongoing maintenance and upkeep costs, and only a small proportion of the money is likely to be spent on the kind of natural flood management projects that conservationists say are necessary to protect wildlife and nature as well as homes., A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “We will continue to work closely with Natural England and the Environment Agency to ensure they have the right resources to continue to not only protect our natural environment but also improve it for future generations.”, Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said: “Now more than ever, urgent action is needed to tackle the climate emergency and the government has been very clear about its ambition to tackle climate change and restore our natural environment. Nature-based solutions such as restoration of peat bogs and our marine sea grass beds will play a huge part in this and Natural England will be at the forefront of delivery.

The early evenings have finally been freed from darkness. As I have countless times before, I go for an aimless wander around gritstone boulders, gorse and heather on top of the Chevin; totally unexceptional, but after not being able to do it for months, it feels like a luxury., I am looking out at the glacial contours of Wharfedale when I hear weird, wonderful sounds behind me. In previous years, a pair of lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) have nested in a field next to the car park, and they seem to have returned for another season. The male barrels around in his aerial display, a spasmodic mixture of twists, tumbles and plunges, and makes noises that sound faintly inorganic, like the blips and glitches of a haunted radio or, as a friend once put it, like Space Invaders. The calls stir up a host of memories, many associated with the cold but budding days before the arrival of proper spring., I can’t say for certain that these are the same individuals as last year; lapwing pairs do return to successful nest sites, but can also abruptly abandon them if disturbed. But this patch of Wharfedale is a landscape I know well, and a seasonal lapwing presence in this field, with the accompanying sights and sounds, is reliable enough that it forms part of my mental map of the place. I don’t just identify these Chevin birds; on seeing them I feel something like individual recognition., I think of other birds that live in the local area and the places I have them mapped to: a kestrel that hunts over the fields near West Chevin; buzzards that I often see whirling above the old railway line; a pair of kingfishers that appear in electrifying glimpses along the river next to what was Ackroyd’s Mill. You won’t find any of these on an Ordnance Survey map, but I use them to orient myself in both space and time. With their help, I know my place, and I find my way through the year.country diary the call of the lapwings orients me in time and place", "label": 0}, "train-510": {"text": "\nUS national parks cause public health concern as visitors flood in\n, Parks have remained open amid the coronavirus and become a haven over the past week, prompting fears for staff and large crowds, Annette McGivney, \n\nTue 17 Mar 2020 13.34 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 28 Mar 2020 18.26 EDT\n\n, Even as Broadway shows were shuttered and Disneyland was closed due to the Covid-19, most US national parks were open for business on Tuesday, confounding public health officials and worrying park staff who did not want to be exposed to the virus., National parks have become a haven over the past week as the public seeks places to go during spring break. One park employee reported on Facebook that a visitor center at Big Bend national park was full on Monday with hundreds of people. Another shared a photo of shoulder to shoulder crowds at Zion national park waiting to board shuttle buses. (The park closed its shuttle bus system later in the day.), The only units in the system that have closed in response to Covid-19 are Golden Gate national recreation area, the National Mall and the Statue of Liberty., National park staff who were interviewed for this story but requested anonymity for fear of retribution reported that superintendents in charge of at least two parks had requested permission from the Department of the Interior to close their units but so far no approvals have been granted. The Department of Interior did not respond to a request for comment on its park closure policy. , “Our focus is on ensuring park employees are safe,” said Grand Canyon national park public information officer Lily Daniels., Grand Canyon tourists milled around inside the park visitor center yesterday, rode shuttle buses and ate at restaurants., Daniels said that social distancing measures taken by the park include limiting shuttles to passengers who can find a seat, paying entrance fees at kiosks rather than at counters, and closing the theater inside the visitor center. “We are working in close consultation with the Centers for Disease Control,” she said., Asked about the CDC guidelines on preventing large gatherings of people, Daniels said she was not sure how many people were in the Grand Canyon visitor center yesterday. Grand Canyon is one of the most popular parks in the system with nearly 6 million visitors a year., Many national parks offer wide open spaces that are ideal for social distancing and are not inherently risky environments during the coronavirus pandemic. However, park infrastructure such as restrooms and trash cans require regular upkeep from staff in order to prevent the kind of rapid deterioration that occurred during the 2018-2019 government shutdown., Park employees from units across the country vented on social media about fears for themselves and their community. Many staff live in dorm-like quarters., One low-level park employee who cleans public restrooms wrote: “It’s not a matter of if I get sick but when.” While park employees in management positions are allowed to work from home, many minimum wage-level workers are forced to come in contact with visitors from all over the world in order to earn their paycheck., “Politicians never go to the frontlines themselves but they often decide to put others in harm’s way,” said Tom Myers, who has worked as a physician at Grand Canyon national park’s clinic for 30 years. “In this case it’s the park’s working poor, all in the name of maintaining the economy. It’s shameful.”, The fact that southern Utah’s national parks and other popular federal lands are still open prompted the Southeast Utah health department to declare a “local public health emergency” on Sunday in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus to a remote area where no cases had been reported to date., “We are concerned people will come and get sick,” the mayor of Moab, Emily Niehaus, told the Salt Lake Tribune. While Moab is internationally famous for its proximity to iconic national parks like Arches and Canyonlands, its hospital only has 17 beds. “Being a rural community, we don’t have the capacity to deal with a pandemic,” Niehaus added., It may be private concessions operators that finally push the Department of Interior to close parks as coronavirus spreads. On Monday, Eastern National, which runs retail stores in 170 national parks, announced it would no longer provide staffing at those facilities. “Our store staff are unable to maintain the social distancing that the CDC recommends in our store while serving visitors,” wrote Eastern National’s CEO, Kevin Kissling, in a memo sent to national park managers., In the Grand Canyon, private outfitters are also taking matters into their own hands., “We proactively canceled all our trips,” said Dave Logan, owner of Flagstaff, Arizona-based Four Season Guides. “We decided to do it not only for the health of our guests but also for the health of our guides. We don’t want them getting sick and then spreading the virus around in our community.”, The decision is a big financial hit for Logan who depends on the popular spring break hiking season for a large chunk of his revenue. “We refunded every penny,” he said. “My company has a sense of personal responsibility in dealing with this crisis.

He pointed out an area of bright gorse that is one of the few homes in this part of the world for the small pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly. “At the last count there were only 15 of them there. And they only stay in that one very small area.”, A major aim of the super reserve project is to help such creatures spread further so they do not rely on just one tiny area – and so face being wiped out if disaster strikes their home patch., Ways in which this will be done include grazing the heathland with cattle and pigs and letting more human visitors tramp across. The concept is not about preserving the landscape as it is but to create the conditions in which it will change dynamically. It is as the changes are happening that some of the most interesting and rare species can flourish., Some of the developments that will be made at Purbeck will be obvious such as removing non-native Scots pine. But other improvements will be much more subtle including simply encouraging bare patches that plants liked by the nationally scarce yellow centaury., Brown is keen on the carnivorous plants that can do well here including the sundews. “You can sometimes see dragon fly wings floating on the surface of the boggy pools.The sundews digest their bodies and spit out the hard bits like the wings.”, Birds that do better here than in most places include the Dartford warbler, which dines on spiders that live in the gorse and the woodlark, another lover of tree-cleared ground., The new Purbeck Heaths NNR knits together 11 types of priority habitat to enable wildlife to move more easily across the landscape. This will give wildlife, including the sand lizard and the Dartford warbler a better chance of adapting and thriving in light of the current climate crisis., It combines three existing NNRs at Stoborough Heath, Hartland Moor, and Studland and Godlingston Heath. They will be linked with other nature reserves, conservation areas and a golf course, which manages its rough to encourage wildlife and plant life. The whole area will cover more than 8,000 acres and together they will create the largest lowland heathland NNR in the UK., Partners also include the Forestry England, the private Rempstone Estate, Dorset Wildlife Trust and the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust., The chair of Natural England, Tony Juniper said: “By creating bigger, better, and more joined-up wild places like this one, we will achieve big benefits for both people and wildlife., “In facing the twin and deepening challenges of global heating and wildlife loss, we need to think and act on a larger scale. Today’s move marks a shift in gear and a new era for nature recovery in England.”, Purbeck Heaths is one of the most biodiverse places in the UK – home to thousands of species of wildlife, including 450 that are listed as rare, threatened or protected., All six native reptiles are to be found here, including endangered smooth snakes and sand lizards. As well as the smaller birds such as the stonechat, raptors including hen harriers, marsh harriers, merlins, hobbies and ospreys hunt the heathland., At least 12 species of bats on the heaths. It is also one of the last strongholds for many specialist insects and other invertebrates, such as southern damselflies and the Purbeck mason wasp., Mark Harold, the National Trust’s director of land &amp; nature, said: “All the rare and beautiful wildlife living in and beyond the reserve will benefit hugely from a landscape where habitats are bigger, in better condition and better connected – and where natural processes are restored. Here they will be able to spread and build more resilient populations.”, Environment minister Rebecca Pow said it was a landmark project. “Purbeck Heaths is a trailblazing example of how landscape-scale conservation can help wildlife thrive, improve people’s well-being, and build resilience to climate change,” she said.uks first super national nature reserve created in dorset", "label": 0}, "train-513": {"text": "Pine tree near flooded Czech village voted European tree of the year, Winner beats stiff competition from Croatian gingko tree, Portuguese chestnut and English oak, A lonely pine tree believed by superstitious locals to act as sentinel over a flooded Czech village has been chosen as Europe’s tree of the year, beating stiff competition from a Croatian gingko tree, a Portuguese chestnut and an English oak., The Guardian of the Flooded Village has grown for 350 years on a rocky height near the village of Chudobin, said locally to play host to a devil that sat under it at night, playing the violin and warding off intruders – though in reality the eerie sounds are more likely to have come from the strong winds blowing over the valley., Its guardianship was doomed, however, as a dam was constructed on the site and flooded the village, leaving only the lonely pine tree as witness to its former existence.

This underlying health damage means respiratory infections, such as coronavirus, may well have a more serious impact on city dwellers and those exposed to toxic fumes, than on others., However, strict confinement measures in China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and in Italy, Europe’s most affected nation, have led to falls in air pollution as fewer vehicles are driven and industrial emissions fall. A preliminary calculation by a US expert suggests that tens of thousands of premature deaths from air pollution may have been avoided by the cleaner air in China, far higher than the 3,208 coronavirus deaths., The experts stressed, however, that no one is claiming the pandemic can be seen as good for health and it is too early for conclusive studies to have been done. In particular, they said, other indirect health impacts of the coronavirus, via lost income and lack of treatment for other illnesses, will also be large., While urban air pollution has declined in developed countries, the understanding of the widespread damage it causes to health has increased, and toxic air has risen to extreme levels in developing countries, such as India., “Patients with chronic lung and heart conditions caused or worsened by long-term exposure to air pollution are less able to fight off lung infections and more likely to die. This is likely also the case for Covid-19,” said Sara De Matteis, at Cagliari University, Italy, and a member of the environmental health committee of the European Respiratory Society. “By lowering air pollution levels we can help the most vulnerable in their fight against this and any possible future pandemics.”, There is evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks that those exposed to dirty air are more at risk of dying. Scientists who analysed the Sars coronavirus outbreak in China in 2003 found that infected people who lived in areas with more air pollution were twice as likely to die as those in less polluted places., Research on the Mers coronavirus outbreak, first seen in Saudi Arabia in 2012, showed that tobacco smokers were more likely to get the disease and were more likely to die. Early research on Covid-19 suggests smokers and former smokers are more susceptible to the virus. But one difference is that Covid-19 appears to have a lower overall mortality rate than Sars or Mers., “Given what we know now, it is very likely that people who are exposed to more air pollution and who are smoking tobacco products are going to fare worse if infected with Covid-19 than those who are breathing cleaner air, and who don’t smoke,” Aaron Bernstein, at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health told the Washington Post., Reductions in air pollution have been recorded over northern Italy, the centre of that nation’s outbreak. Air pollution also fell sharply across China in the four weeks after 25 January, when regions shut down in response to the outbreak. The level of PM2.5, dangerous small pollution particles, fell by 25%, while nitrogen dioxide, produced mainly by diesel vehicles, dropped by 40%., The link between such pollutants and early deaths are well known and Marshall Burke, at Stanford University in the US, used the data to estimate the impacts on air pollution mortality. The young and old are worst affected by dirty air and, using conservative assumptions, Burke calculated the cleaner air may have prevented 1,400 early deaths in children under five and 51,700 early deaths in people over 70., “It seems clearly incorrect and foolhardy to conclude that pandemics are good for health,” he said. “But the calculation is perhaps a useful reminder of the often-hidden health consequences of the status quo, ie, the substantial costs that our current way of doing things exacts on our health and livelihoods.”, He said that indirect impacts of Covid-19 are probably much higher than currently known. “It seems likely that any ‘benefits’ from reduced air pollution are going to be dominated by the direct and, especially, the indirect costs of the virus, such as the health effects of lost income and the morbidity/mortality costs of non-Covid health problems going untreated.”, Sascha Marschang, the acting secretary general of the European Public Health Alliance, said: “Once this crisis is over, policymakers should speed up measures to get dirty vehicles off our roads. Science tells us that epidemics like Covid-19 will occur with increasing frequency. So cleaning up the streets is a basic investment for a healthier future.”air pollution likely to increase coronavirus death rate warn experts", "label": 0}, "train-515": {"text": "\nCountry diary: the fellowship of frogs\n, Buxton, Derbyshire: There is something funny and gloriously shameless about the amphibians’ mating behaviour , \nMark Cocker, \n\nTue 17 Mar 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n, What is it about mating common frogs that is so humorous? Part of it is surely their physical comedy, such as the winking white throats bellowing in and out as the males chorus at the surface. Then there are the old man’s skinny legs on all frogs. My mother-in-law mentions the ear-to-ear grin across every frog face., Another friend talks about an aura of “smugness” about them and, indeed, there is something faintly ridiculous about the way one will climb across the spawn lolling at the surface, and stand on top, full square, head raised proudly as if in ownership of the entire hoard., There is also something gloriously shameless about frogs: how they will clamber over their fellows, briefly smothering them or working with those immense hindlegs against a neighbour’s face, forcing each gold-rimmed black eye to close, then reopen after it finally passes. None seems to mind either the inconvenience or these levels of familiarity., The thing I love most, aside from the song – the throaty granular music that swells up at the surface and is as smooth as frog skin in water – is the animals’ collective willingness to accept me. Make a sudden move and you are left with an empty pond, but for many small overlapping ripples, yet slow your pace to a heron’s stalk and you can get right down among them. In fact, I can vouch that a human thumb and four fingers at the water’s surface can start to seem highly attractive to an amorous frog., At that range you can watch each pinhole nostril on an amphibian’s nose, billowing air in and out, working precisely as it has done for the last 200m years. And to kneel in my waders among the pond’s atmosphere of natural abundance, to be accepted on equal terms by its owners, provided a special kind of reward. For a moment, amid the wider church-bell-ringing song of song thrushes or the chiming of great tits, surrounded by the fellowship of frogs, I was allowed to feel that March 2020 was like any other spring, and that all would soon be well with the world.country diary the fellowship of frogs", "label": 0}, "train-516": {"text": "Nature's healing potential – for us, and the planet, The destruction of the countryside is denting my optimism, writes John Green.

When I return to the lanes, hedgerows and woods I loved as a boy, where I found birds’ nests every 50 yards or so, watched field mice clambering with acrobatic agility up the stems of swaying wheat and heard the mournful piping of curlews and redshank from the marshy fields, today there is only an eerie stillness and scarcely a fluttering wingbeat over the monotone greenery., When, in 2000, I wrote and illustrated my book Wings Over the Valley: A Birdwatcher’s Wales Diary, about the joys of birdwatching and the countryside, communicating that exhilaration gave me renewed strength and optimism, but those feelings have been shattered in the face of the continued destruction of our countryside.John GreenLondon, • It’s good to read that highway authorities and the construction industry are taking the greening of our roadsides seriously (Flower power: the route map to a roadside revolution, 14 March), but we also need to get to grips with the huge increase in paved-over front gardens., We may need to find a place to park cars, but the case for having a green space around our homes is very persuasive. Not only do plants and trees help keep our homes cool in summer and warm in winter, but every blade of grass also absorbs carbon dioxide and emits oxygen, thus playing a part in stopping climate change. Green spaces in residential areas are an essential stopping-off point for butterflies, birds and bees., The Royal Horticultural Society reports that almost a third of front gardens are now paved over. The RHS Greening Great Britain campaign gives lots of hints to people who could be encouraged to leave space for flowers, shrubs or trees., If, like me, you’d like to congratulate those who have a green front garden, visit Healthy Life Essex at https://bit.ly/2WeFH6L, where you will find a downloadable thank-you card to pop through the letterbox.Eileen PeckBenfleet, Essex, • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com, • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters, • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

It will open once the pharmacy is fully stocked. The 20-bed hospital will treat less critical inpatients, in order to free up intensive care units in nearby facilities, and prioritize Native Americans from any tribe., “Our unique approach has piqued a lot of state and federal interest, we’re offering them a different model which shows that tribes are part of the solution in recovery efforts,” said the tribal chairman, Lawrence Solomon. “No private organization is going to try what we’re doing.”, The tribe’s proactive response to the evolving global pandemic has been possible thanks to vast improvements to the quality and capacity of its community healthcare system over the past decade., Like an increasing number of tribes, the Lummi nation has opted for “self-determination” which enables greater financial flexibility and clinical autonomy – as opposed to depending on the federally controlled Indian Health Service (IHS) which has suffered decades of severe underfunding., As a result, the Lummi health services raises substantial revenue by treating patients on Medicaid and Medicare – the third party billing program created by President Obama in 2010. This extra cash has allowed them to invest in infrastructure and build capacity: the tribe now has eight doctors compared with just three in 2013, including three physicians with public health expertise., CDC modeling suggests that anywhere between 2.4 million and 21 million people in the US could require hospitalization during the course of the pandemic, potentially overwhelming the hospital system which has only 925,000 beds nationwide., The Lummi want to help. Dr Lane said: “The Lummi believe in controlling our own destiny. We don’t count on help reaching us, but the hospital is something we can do to help the community.”covidcoronavirus native american lummi nation trailblazing steps", "label": 0}, "train-518": {"text": "\n'Wonderchicken': oldest fossil of modern bird discovered\n, Tiny creature, half the size of a mallard, found in rocks dating back to dinosaur age, \nNicola Davis, \n\nWed 18 Mar 2020 12.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 12.04 EDT\n\n, Experts have discovered a fossil of the world’s oldest known modern bird – a diminutive creature about half the size of a mallard duck., Dubbed the Wonderchicken, the remains were found in rocks dating to about 66.8m to 66.7m years ago, revealing that the bird was active shortly before the asteroid strike that wiped out the dinosaurs 66m years ago., “This is the oldest evidence of modern birds that we have so far,” said Dr Daniel Field, of the University of Cambridge, an avian palaeontologist and co-author of the research., Modern birds evolved from meat-eating theropod dinosaurs, with creatures such as the 150 million-year-old Archaeopteryx cropping up along the way. In sharp contrast to Archaeopteryx, modern birds have no teeth and tend to lack the bony tails and clawed wings of many of their predecessors., It is not clear exactly when modern birds emerged, but estimates range from about 110m years to 85-70m years ago., “As best as we can tell, this fossil sits very close to the common ancestor of two major groups of living birds – the group that eventually gave rise to chickens and their relatives, and the group that eventually gave rise to ducks and their relatives,” Field said., The team says the discovery pushes back the date of the earliest known modern bird: the record was previously held by Vegavis whose fossils were discovered in Antarctica and dated to about 66.5m years ago., Writing in the journal Nature, Field and colleagues describe making the discovery while carrying out CT scans on a specimen donated to Maastricht Natural History Museum. The fossils were unearthed 20 years ago by an amateur fossil hunter at a quarry in Belgium, near the border with the Netherlands, within sedimentary marine rock that is part of the so-called Maastricht Formation., At first, said Field, the specimen appeared unprepossessing. “It is basically four small blocks of rock with a handful of broken limb bones visible, poking out of the rock,” he said. However, on digitally “removing” the low-density rock around the fossil using computer software, the team found something special., “As soon as I did that, this incredible skull – one of the most incredible fossil bird skulls in the world – stared straight out at us, and we could not believe our eyes,” said Field, noting that the lack of teeth and other features of the skull quickly suggested it was from an early modern bird., The team say the bird would have weighed about 400g, about half the size or less of a mallard duck. “It is the same size as a green-winged teal, which is one of the smallest ducks in the entire world,” said Field. “We think it would have had a face that looked a little bit like a modern chicken, and the back of the skull looked a little bit more like a living duck,” he said. Its long slender legs – together with the rocks it was found in – suggest it may have lived along the shoreline., The bird’s official name is Asteriornis maastrichtensis, a reference to the place it was found and the Greek goddess of falling stars, Asteria., “We thought that that was apropos because the fossil is so close in time to the asteroid impact,” said Field, adding the Greek myth describes Asteria being transformed into a quail and throwing herself into the ocean to avoid Zeus, features that nod both to the animal and the habitat in which it may have lived., The team say the fossils not only suggest modern bird evolution was in its early stages when the asteroid struck, but its discovery in Europe opens up debate about whether modern birds emerged in the southern hemisphere, as has previously been proposed., Prof Julia Clarke, an expert in avian palaeontology and Vegavis from the University of Texas, in Austin, who was not involved in the study, described the find as “fantastic” and said it fitted in well with predictions based on Vegavis.,  “Finding this new fossil in Europe is key to understanding a global pattern of extinction and survivorship in the Latest Cretaceous,” she said. , Prof Mike Benton, a palaeontologist from the University of Bristol, said the new skull was “gorgeous”, adding that previous contenders for the world’s oldest duck have been queried, and that fossils hunters have been searching hard for unambiguous members of the modern bird group that definitely lived before the dinosaur mass extinction., “The new fossil ticks all the boxes,” he said.wonderchicken oldest fossil of modern bird discovered", "label": 0}, "train-519": {"text": "\nCop26: Boris Johnson urged to resist calls to postpone climate talks\n, Expert says early cancellation due to coronavirus would damage hopes of progress, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nWed 18 Mar 2020 10.31 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 11.06 EDT\n\n, Nicholas Stern, one of the most prominent global experts on the climate crisis, has urged Boris Johnson to resist calls to postpone vital UN climate talks this year, despite the coronavirus outbreak., Ministers and officials have privately discussed the possibility of postponing the Cop26 talks scheduled for Glasgow this November, but no decision has yet been taken. Travel bans and the shutdown imposed in many countries because of the virus have resulted in cancelled meetings and officials working remotely., Lord Stern believes any move to postpone the talks would put paid to any hope of making real progress. “At the moment we must just get on with the preparation,” he said. “This is such an urgent challenge and there is so much to do, and so much valuable work that is being done, that we can’t afford to lose the momentum.”, At Cop26 – the 26th conference of the parties – countries are supposed to come up with more stringent plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions, because current plans under the Paris agreement are inadequate. The UK was hoping to bring many countries to the table with pledges to hit net zero carbon by 2050, a target that the UK has already enshrined in law., Stern said work had become more difficult because of the virus, but not impossible. Postponing the summit now would effectively put the brakes on at a time when acceleration is needed, he said, and if needs be then a postponement could be discussed after the summer, depending on the situation then., Stern is backed by other former high-ranking diplomats. Yvo de Boer, a former chief of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), who led talks in Copenhagen in 2009 that ended in acrimony, said it was vital to keep working towards a November Cop26. “If it is going to be cancelled, that should only be done at the last possible minute – in October,” he said., ﻿One former high-ranking official who helped put together the Paris agreement said: “Cancelling now might look like the UK was grasping too soon for a way out of an important meeting.”, Some NGOs and developing country experts also view talk of postponement as counterproductive. Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa and a close observer of the talks for many years, said: “We would rather not see it cancelled until we know more about the spread of the virus. Cancelling it immediately might mean action on climate change gets ignored this year and people on the frontlines in poorer countries can’t afford that.”, Janine Felson, the deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: “We cannot afford to lose any momentum. We should all focus our energies on ensuring that we can support each other through this trying time and continue to push for ambition.”, But some experts contacted by the Guardian believe postponing the talks would provide more time for diplomacy. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, has written to Alok Sharma, the business secretary and president of Cop26, urging him to delay., He said: “Postponement is very different to cancellation. It would be the same president, the same venue, the same two countries co-hosting, so all you are doing is having a slight delay. The UK got off to a slow start in launching its strategy for hosting Cop26 so postponement would give more time for the work that is needed.” , One key issue is that the US presidential election is due to take place a week before Cop26 begins. Donald Trump is strongly opposed to the Paris agreement and his withdrawal from it will take effect the day after the election. A new president, if there is one, could be more amenable to climate action but would not take office until January, so a postponement could allow the US to participate., Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute in the US, said: “One distinct advantage of delay until spring 2021 is the growing prospect that US voters will turn Trump’s climate nihilism out of office in favour of Joe Biden’s robust climate ambition, infusing global negotiations with far greater importance and momentum.”, Some pre-Cop meetings are already in doubt. The UNFCCC has cancelled all meetings for the next month but a decision will have to be taken soon on an intermediate meeting set for Bonn in June. Italy is due to co-host Cop26 with the UK but its plans have been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus pandemic., The UK government has said there are no plans for a change. A spokesperson said: “We continue to work towards hosting the event in Glasgow in November, which is eight months away. Given this is an evolving situation we are keeping the situation under careful review.”, The UNFCCC also said there was no immediate move to postpone the talks. Any decision would have to be taken by the Cop Bureau, made up of elected representatives from various countries, and would also involve the Chilean government, which technically will preside over the process until the UK officially takes on the presidency in November. cop26 boris johnson urged resist calls postpone climate talks coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-520": {"text": "\nBillion-dollar wildlife industry in Vietnam under assault as law drafted to halt trading\n, Move will hopefully curb vast wildlife trade from farm, street markets, and online traders, Chris Humphrey, \n\nWed 18 Mar 2020 06.16 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 19 Mar 2020 10.11 EDT\n\n, Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, has asked the country’s agriculture ministry to draft a directive to stop illegal trading and consumption of wildlife over fears it spreads disease., The directive, seen as a victory for animal rights organisations, will lead to a clamping down on street-side markets dotted across the country, increase prosecutions of online traders and ideally put pressure on thousands of farms with known links to illegal wildlife trading., Vitenam’s move to ban the wildlife trade follows similar moves by the Chinese government, after the new coronavirus pandemic appeared to have emerged from a wet market in Wuhan., Both illegal and “legal” wildlife trading flourishes in Vietnam, where the trade has grown into a billion-dollar industry. There are thousands of markets around the country, many of which include stalls selling animals for food or as pets. Anyone walking around some of the street-side stalls of the Mekong delta can see fish tanks stuffed with sea turtles or skinned-alive frogs., There is also a thriving online trade in animals. Many sellers advertise on Facebook, uploading photos of leopard cats caught in mesh nets, dead pangolins stored in a freezer, slaughtered macaque monkeys, frozen tiger cubs, butchered bats or even freshly barbecued wildlife. They are bought as status symbols, pets, food, or to be used in traditional medicines., Yet the largest issue in terms of Vietnam’s wildlife trade is the nation’s “legal” commercial farms, where you can see maltreated civets in metal cages or an array of rare reptiles. Across Vietnam, bears are still trapped in tiny cages on bear bile farms, while Nghe An province in central Vietnam is known for tiger farms., “Opportunistic farmers can legally acquire licences for a plethora of species. Some of these species are incredibly difficult to raise in captivity while others are not economically viable to raise and sell profitably, but it has not been a common practice to involve third parties in the process of licensing farms, so the authorities are issuing permits to trade native species that can only be sourced from the wild,” Douglas Hendrie, director of enforcement for local environment NGO Education for Nature Vietnam (ENV) told the Guardian., “Additionally, in some cases farmers can get away with trading completely protected species which are not even allowed to be farmed due to authorities lacking education on species protection. With such a poorly regulated and enforced commercial wildlife farming industry few fear prosecution.”, “Animals from these farms and ‘conservation’ facilities are then sold via a huge ‘legal’ industry to businessmen, restaurants, traditional medicine shops and even across the border into China,” Hendrie added., On 20 November, Vietnamese authorities investigated a wildlife farm and temporarily seized 57 animals from 19 different species, the Guardian has learned. In this case, the owner was caught in possession of more than 10 species protected by law – a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It is this diversity of species – as seen in Wuhan’s wet market – that can lead to the spread of disease., According to Hendrie, online trading has grown in appeal as sellers can hide their identity while reaching more buyers. Entire Facebook pages are dedicated to ivory, rhino horns and bear claws or posting photos of animals being caught or slaughtered. Last year ENV recorded more than 2,400 advertisements in violation of wildlife protection laws on Facebook, YouTube, Zalo and other online platforms, along with more than 600 people caught illegally possessing wildlife., Vietnam began recognising protected wildlife species listed by Cites (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) in 1994. Currently, Vietnamese law prohibits the trafficking of protected wildlife products, such as pangolins or rhinos, and the illegal trading or killing of wildlife. Yet campaigners say the illegal trade continues to flourish thanks to poor enforcement. Convicted criminals can face imprisonment or a fine of more than $600 (£500)., Hanoi-based wildlife NGO Pan Nature recently sent a letter to the prime minister’s office – signed by 14 other environmental NGOs including WWF, Animals Asia, ENV and Traffic – calling on authorities to close markets and other locations where illegal wildlife is on sale. And the prime minister has now asked Vietnam’s agriculture ministry to draft a directive and present it by 1 April., Trinh Le Nguyen, executive director at Pan Nature, said the conservation community in Vietnam has “unanimously joined hands” to propose recommendations to the government., “We welcome the proactive response from the prime minister with specific guidance to relevant agencies for drafting the directive to completely ban illegal wildlife consumption and trade in Vietnam,” he said. “We hope to see Vietnam as a country free of illegal wildlife trade in a very near future. We expect unanimous actions of government agencies in enforcing wildlife protection laws.”, The exact actions made possible by the new directive will become clear when it’s presented at the beginning of April. The 14 NGOs that signed the letter are pushing for the closure of wildlife markets, increased policing of online sales and an end to permits for transporting large quantities of wildlife., Any suspicious shipments, they say, should be reported to police, while large deliveries of “legal” wildlife should be investigated to determine whether laundering was involved. If there is evidence of crime, farms’ licences could be revoked and sentences of up to 15 years handed out.billion dollar wildlife industry in vietnam under assault as law drafted to halt trading", "label": 0}, "train-521": {"text": "\n'Tip of the iceberg': is our destruction of nature responsible for Covid-19?\n, As habitat and biodiversity loss increase globally, the coronavirus outbreak may be just the beginning of mass pandemics, \nJohn Vidal, \n\nWed 18 Mar 2020 02.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 19 Mar 2020 16.41 EDT\n\n, Mayibout 2 is not a healthy place. The 150 or so people who live in the village, which sits on the south bank of the Ivindo River, deep in the great Minkebe Forest in northern Gabon, are used to occasional bouts of diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and sleeping sickness. Mostly they shrug them off., But in January 1996, Ebola, a deadly virus then barely known to humans, unexpectedly spilled out of the forest in a wave of small epidemics. The disease killed 21 of 37 villagers who were reported to have been infected, including a number who had carried, skinned, chopped or eaten a chimpanzee from the nearby forest., I travelled to Mayibout 2 in 2004 to investigate why deadly diseases new to humans were emerging from biodiversity “hotspots” such as tropical rainforests and bushmeat markets in African and Asian cities., It took a day by canoe and then many hours along degraded forest logging roads, passing Baka villages and a small goldmine, to reach the village. There, I found traumatised people still fearful that the deadly virus, which kills up to 90% of the people it infects, would return., Villagers told me how children had gone into the forest with dogs that had killed the chimp. They said that everyone who cooked or ate it got a terrible fever within a few hours. Some died immediately, while others were taken down the river to hospital. A few, like Nesto Bematsick, recovered. “We used to love the forest, now we fear it,” he told me. Many of Bematsick’s family members died., Only a decade or two ago it was widely thought that tropical forests and intact natural environments teeming with exotic wildlife threatened humans by harbouring the viruses and pathogens that lead to new diseases in humans such as Ebola, HIV and dengue., But a number of researchers today think that it is actually humanity’s destruction of biodiversity that creates the conditions for new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19, the viral disease that emerged in China in December 2019, to arise – with profound health and economic impacts in rich and poor countries alike. In fact, a new discipline, planetary health, is emerging that focuses on the increasingly visible connections between the wellbeing of humans, other living things and entire ecosystems., Is it possible, then, that it was human activity, such as road building, mining, hunting and logging, that triggered the Ebola epidemics in Mayibout 2 and elsewhere in the 1990s and that is unleashing new terrors today?, “We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbour so many species of animals and plants – and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses,” David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Pandemic, recently wrote in the New York Times. “We cut the trees; we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.”, Research suggests that outbreaks of animal-borne and other infectious diseases such as Ebola, Sars, bird flu and now Covid-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, are on the rise. Pathogens are crossing from animals to humans, and many are able to spread quickly to new places. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that three-quarters of new or emerging diseases that infect humans originate in animals., Some, like rabies and plague, crossed from animals centuries ago. Others, such as Marburg, which is thought to be transmitted by bats, are still rare. A few, like Covid-19, which emerged last year in Wuhan, China, and Mers, which is linked to camels in the Middle East, are new to humans and spreading globally., Other diseases that have crossed into humans include Lassa fever, which was first identified in 1969 in Nigeria; Nipah from Malaysia; and Sars from China, which killed more than 700 people and travelled to 30 countries in 2002–03. Some, like Zika and West Nile virus, which emerged in Africa, have mutated and become established on other continents., Kate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at UCL, calls emerging animal-borne infectious diseases an “increasing and very significant threat to global health, security and economies”., In 2008, Jones and a team of researchers identified 335 diseases that emerged between 1960 and 2004, at least 60% of which came from animals., Increasingly, says Jones, these zoonotic diseases are linked to environmental change and human behaviour. The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she says., The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now “a hidden cost of human economic development. There are just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely undisturbed places and being exposed more and more. We are creating habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily, and then we are surprised that we have new ones.”, Jones studies how changes in land use contribute to the risk. “We are researching how species in degraded habitats are likely to carry more viruses which can infect humans,” she says. “Simpler systems get an amplification effect. Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left with are the ones humans get the diseases from.”, “There are countless pathogens out there continuing to evolve which at some point could pose a threat to humans,” says Eric Fevre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Infection and Global Health. “The risk of pathogens jumping from animals to humans has always been there.”, The difference between now and a few decades ago, Fevre says, is that diseases are likely to spring up in both urban and natural environments. “We have created densely packed populations where alongside us are bats and rodents and birds, pets and other living things. That creates intense interaction and opportunities for things to move from species to species,” he says., “Pathogens do not respect species boundaries,” says disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University’s  department of  environmental  sciences, who studies how shrinking natural habitats and changing behaviour add to the risk of diseases spilling over from animals to humans., “I am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,” he says. “The majority of pathogens are still to be discovered. We are at the very tip of the iceberg.”, Humans, says Gillespie, are creating the conditions for the spread of diseases by reducing the natural barriers between host animals – in which the virus is naturally circulating – and themselves. “We fully expect the arrival of pandemic influenza; we can expect large-scale human mortalities; we can expect other pathogens with other impacts. A disease like Ebola is not easily spread. But something with a mortality rate of Ebola spread by something like measles would be catastrophic,” Gillespie says., Wildlife everywhere is being put under more stress, he says. “Major landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats, which means species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with humans. Species that survive change are now moving and mixing with different animals and with humans.”, Gillespie sees this in the US, where suburbs fragment forests and raise the risk of humans contracting Lyme disease. “Altering the ecosystem affects the complex cycle of the Lyme pathogen. People living close by are more likely to get bitten by a tick carrying Lyme bacteria,” he says., Yet human health research seldom considers the surrounding natural ecosystems, says Richard Ostfeld, distinguished senior scientist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. He and others are developing the emerging discipline of planetary health, which looks at the links between human and ecosystem health., “There’s misapprehension among scientists and the public that natural ecosystems are the source of threats to ourselves. It’s a mistake. Nature poses threats, it is true, but it’s human activities that do the real damage. The health risks in a natural environment can be made much worse when we interfere with it,” he says., Ostfeld points to rats and bats, which are strongly linked with the direct and indirect spread of zoonotic diseases. “Rodents and some bats thrive when we disrupt natural habitats. They are the most likely to promote transmissions of pathogens. The more we disturb the forests and habitats the more danger we are in,” he says., Felicia Keesing, professor of biology at Bard College, New York, studies how environmental changes influence the probability that humans will be exposed to infectious diseases. “When we erode biodiversity, we see a proliferation of the species most likely to transmit new diseases to us, but there’s also good evidence that those same species are the best hosts for existing diseases,” she wrote in an email to Ensia, the nonprofit media outlet that reports on our changing planet., Disease ecologists argue that viruses and other pathogens are also likely to move from animals to humans in the many informal markets that have sprung up to provide fresh meat to fast-growing urban populations around the world. Here, animals are slaughtered, cut up and sold on the spot., The “wet market” (one that sells fresh produce and meat) in Wuhan, thought by the Chinese government to be the starting point of the current Covid-19 pandemic, was known to sell numerous wild animals, including live wolf pups, salamanders, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, squirrels, foxes, civets and turtles., Equally, urban markets in west and central Africa sell monkeys, bats, rats, and dozens of species of bird, mammal, insect and rodent slaughtered and sold close to open refuse dumps and with no drainage., “Wet markets make a perfect storm for cross-species transmission of pathogens,” says Gillespie. “Whenever you have novel interactions with a range of species in one place, whether that is in a natural environment like a forest or a wet market, you can have a spillover event.”, The Wuhan market, along with others that sell live animals, has been shut by the Chinese authorities, and last month Beijing outlawed the trading and eating of wild animals except for fish and seafood. But bans on live animals being sold in urban areas or informal markets are not the answer, say some scientists., “The wet market in Lagos is notorious. It’s like a nuclear bomb waiting to happen. But it’s not fair to demonise places which do not have fridges. These traditional markets provide much of the food for Africa and Asia,” says Jones., “These markets are essential sources of food for hundreds of millions of poor people, and getting rid of them is impossible,” says Delia Grace, a senior epidemiologist and veterinarian with the International Livestock Research Institute, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She argues that bans force traders underground, where they may pay less attention to hygiene., Fevre and colleague Cecilia Tacoli, principal researcher in the human settlements research group at the International Institute of Environment and Development (IIED), argue in a blog post that rather than pointing the finger at wet markets, we should look at the burgeoning trade in wild animals., “It is wild animals rather than farmed animals that are the natural hosts of many viruses,” they write. “Wet markets are considered part of the informal food trade that is often blamed for contributing to spreading disease. But … evidence shows the link between informal markets and disease is not always so clear cut.”, So what, if anything, can we do about all of this?, Jones says that change must come from both rich and poor societies. Demand for wood, minerals and resources from the global north leads to the degraded landscapes and ecological disruption that drives disease, she says. “We must think about global biosecurity, find the weak points and bolster the provision of health care in developing countries. Otherwise we can expect more of the same,” she adds., “The risks are greater now. They were always present and have been there for generations. It is our interactions with that risk which must be changed,” says Brian Bird, a research virologist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine One Health Institute, where he leads Ebola-related surveillance activities in Sierra Leone and elsewhere., “We are in an era now of chronic emergency,” Bird says. “Diseases are more likely to travel further and faster than before, which means we must be faster in our responses. It needs investments, change in human behaviour, and it means we must listen to people at community levels.”, Getting the message about pathogens and disease to hunters, loggers, market traders and consumers is key, Bird says. “These spillovers start with one or two people.

The most numerous beneficiaries are yellow meadow ants (Lasius flavus), whose mounds have been built grain by grain, with earth mined from underground galleries and carried to the surface in tiny jaws. They are everywhere, sometimes so densely clustered as to be visible in aerial mapping images, but the beauty of this ant-engineered landscape is best appreciated from only a few inches away., There is an annual floral cycle on the summits of this undulating ant hill metropolis, unbroken over centuries and maintained by millions of social insects that are rarely disturbed, except when hungry green woodpeckers hack into their nests and raid their underground galleries., Now, at winter’s end, every ant-hill dome is capped by an emerald blanket of mosses, already giving way to new spring growth of wildflowers. Kneeling down, I could see the first barren strawberry flower buds opening. Unfurling leaves of pignut, heath bedstraw, speedwell, hawkweeds, bird’s-foot trefoil, creeping cinquefoil and dog violets (Viola riviniana) were forcing their way through. Spring comes early to the flora of these knee-high islands, exposed to the warmth of the sun and raised above a surrounding sea of competing pasture grasses., Most wildflower species arrive here by chance, but the violets probably owe their presence to unwitting ant gardeners, because their seeds have a small, nutritious oily protuberance called an elaiosome, which ants find irresistible. They will eat these wherever they find them, but undoubtedly carry some back to the colony, where discarded seeds germinate on the mound., By August, the ant excavators, hollowing out new nest chambers, will have partially buried some plants under a new layer of soil particles. Summer droughts take their toll, when parched soil leaves many hummocks with bald patches, only covered again with a revived wig of mosses when cool, wet autumn weather returns.country diary this ant engineered landscape dog violets durham", "label": 0}, "train-523": {"text": "\nStudy: global banks 'failing miserably' on climate crisis by funneling trillions into fossil fuels\n, Analysis of 35 leading investment banks shows financing of more than $2.66tn for fossil fuel industries since the Paris agreement , \nPatrick Greenfield and \nKalyeena Makortoff, \n\nWed 18 Mar 2020 00.01 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 18.25 EDT\n\n, The world’s largest investment banks have funnelled more than £2.2tn ($2.66tn) into fossil fuels since the Paris agreement, new figures show, prompting warnings they are failing to respond to the climate crisis., The US bank JP Morgan Chase, whose economists warned that the climate crisis threatens the survival of humanity last month, has been the largest financier of fossil fuels in the four years since the agreement, providing over £220bn of financial services to extract oil, gas and coal., Analysis of the 35 leading global investment banks, by an alliance of US-based environmental groups, said that financing for the companies most aggressively expanding in new fossil fuel extraction since the Paris agreement has surged by nearly 40% in the last year., Using Bloomberg financial data and other sources to analyse loans, equity issuances and debt underwriting services from 2016 to 2019, the analysis is published on Wednesday in the Banking on Climate Change 2020 report., It has been compiled by Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oil Change International, Reclaim Finance and Sierra Club., Although the last 12 months has seen many investment banks announce financing restrictions on coal, Arctic oil and gas, and tar sands extraction, the report warns that the business practices of financial institutions are not aligned with the Paris agreement., Alongside JP Morgan Chase, the US banks Wells Fargo, Citi and Bank of America dominate financing for fossil fuels, accounting for nearly a third of the £2.2tn of financial services since the Paris agreement, according to the report., The report said big banks overall have increased their funding in the four years since Paris to companies with significant Arctic oil and gas reserves., Alison Kirsch, a researcher at Rainforest Action Network who led the analysis in the report, said: “The data reveal that global banks are not only ramping up financing of fossil fuels overall, but are also increasing funding for the companies most responsible for fossil fuel expansion.”, Barclays, which has been under increasing investor pressure over its environmental stance, has been the top European financier of fossil fuels in the last four years, the figures show. Last year, the London-based bank was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas, according to the figures., A group of influential shareholders are now urging the bank to phase out lending to fossil fuel companies, and have filed a resolution to be voted on at Barclays’ AGM in May., Fracking has been the focus of intense business activity by investment banks since the Paris agreement, with JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America leading £241.53bn of financing, much of it linked to the Permian basin in Texas., The Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion led financing for tar sands crude oil projects in Alberta, north-west Canada, which have caused widespread damage to ecosystems., The big-four Chinese banks have dominated financing for coal mining and coal power since the Paris agreement and have no policies restricting business practices., Kirsch said: “This makes it crystal clear that banks are failing miserably when it comes to responding to the urgency of the climate crisis. As the toll of death and destruction from unprecedented floods, droughts, fires and storms grows, it is unconscionable and outrageous for banks to be approving new loans and raising capital for the companies that are pushing hardest to increase carbon emissions.”, Ahead of the next major international climate talks, Cop26 in Glasgow this November, the UK government has sought to make the business and the banking sector the focus of tacking the climate crisis. The former head of the Bank of England Mark Carney has been appointed as a climate envoy, warning that businesses must improve how they disclose their impact on the environment or risk failing to meet climate targets., Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack, an NGO which monitors the activities of major financial institutions, said it was time for banks to commit to phasing out financing for all new fossil fuel projects., “In the last year, banks have been queueing up to proclaim support for the goals of the Paris agreement. Both the Principles for Responsible Banking and the new Equator Principles, each signed by over a hundred banks, acknowledges the global climate goals. Yet the data in Banking on Climate Change 2020 show these laudable pledges making little difference, and bank financing for the fossil fuel industry continuing to lead us to the climate abyss,” he said., “It is high time banks recognised that reaching the Paris climate goals requires an immediate end to finance for all new fossil fuel projects, and a rapid phase-out of existing fossil finance. This should be the Global Glasgow Goal for all banks.”, JPMorgan Chase said the commitments it announced last month “reflect our ongoing efforts to help address climate change and promote more sustainable development”., It added: “This includes financing to support climate action and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, backing market-based policy solutions to reduce carbon emissions, expanding restrictions on financing for coal mining and coal-fired power, and prohibiting project financing for new oil and gas development in the Arctic.”, The bank looked forward, it said, to growing “its impact over time”., A Barclays spokesperson said: “We are working hard to help tackle climate change including facilitating £34.8bn of social and environmental financing last year. We continue to engage with ShareAction and other stakeholders on how we can make further progress.”, Wells Fargo told the Guardian that it believes that climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time, and is committing to a low-carbon economy. The bank said it is working to measure and report on the carbon intensity of its credit portfolio., A Bank of America spokesperson said they recognise their role in managing climate risk and in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy., Citigroup did not respond when contacted by the Guardian for comment.global banks climate crisis finance fossil fuels", "label": 0}, "train-524": {"text": "Welsh government plans to ban single-use plastics from next year, Measure to target items such as straws, cutlery and polystyrene food and drink containers, Plastic straws, cutlery and polystyrene food and drink containers look set to be banned in Wales under proposals from the Welsh government., It said the ban would be part of wider measures to make Wales the world’s top recycling nation., The plastics affected include straws, stirrers, cotton buds, balloon sticks, plates and cutlery, food and drinks containers made of expanded polystyrene, and products made from oxo-degradable plastic, such as certain types of carrier bags., Hannah Blythyn, the deputy minister for housing and local government, said a consultation on the proposals would take place in the coming months with restrictions due to be enforced next year., “The single-use plastics we want to ban are hard to recycle and often found on the beaches and seas around our coast, blighting our beautiful country and harming our natural and marine environments,” the minister said., “It is vital we don’t throw away our future – which is why we believe taking this direct action will have a significant impact on changing people’s behaviour and make them think about their waste when ‘on-the-go’., “The measures I am announcing today are part of a range of potential solutions to the plastic problem.

Numbers of all of the three subspecies of black rhino are now improving., “The continued slow recovery is a testament to the immense efforts made in the countries and a powerful reminder that conservation works,” said Grethel Aguilar, acting director general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which compiles the global red list of species under threat., “But there is no room for complacency as poaching and illegal trade remain acute threats. It is essential that the ongoing anti-poaching measures and intensive, proactive population management continue, with support from national and international actors.”, The outlook for the other African rhino species is still troubled, according to the update to the red list published on Thursday., White rhinos are more numerous in Africa but categorised by the IUCN as near-threatened. The outlook for them has worsened in recent years, driven by high levels of poaching in South Africa’s Kruger national park. White rhinos have larger horns than their black counterparts, making them more attractive to poachers, and they are easier to find as they prefer more open habitats., Although white rhino numbers grew between 2007 and 2012, the numbers of the southern white rhino subspecies fell by 15% during that period, from an estimated 21,300 to 18,000, cancelling out previous growth., Poaching levels appear to have declined again in the last few years, down from a peak in 2015 when an average of 3.7 rhinos were killed every day. Estimates for 2019 suggest poaching has declined further, owing to governments taking stronger measures against the organised crime gangs behind poaching., “With the involvement of transnational organised crime in poaching, rhino crimes are not just wildlife crimes,” said Richard Emslie, a coordinator for African rhinos at IUCN. “If the encouraging declines in poaching can continue, this should positively impact rhino numbers. Continued expenditure and efforts will be necessary to maintain this trend.”, The impacts of the coronavirus crisis are also worrying experts, as the halt to tourism will reduce resources for conservation. “The impact of Covid-19 on global tourism is likely to have significant negative impacts on private commercial wildlife operations and state national parks and game reserves that conserve rhino,” said Emslie. “Those in the field paying for all the conservation work on the ground may need more financial support so that they can maintain current efforts despite the virus.”, The costs of keeping rhinos safe have risen greatly in the last decade, however, and live sale prices have fallen, reducing incentives for private landowners and communities to keep rhinos. About half of white rhinos and nearly 40% of black rhinos are on private land or land managed by communities. If the rhinos are viewed as a cost, that will further hamper efforts to protect them., Thursday’s update to the red list showed tha more than 31,000 species around the world are threatened with extinction. The red list is likely to be updated at least three more times this year.win for conservation as african black rhino numbers rise", "label": 0}, "train-526": {"text": "\nUK nature reserves stay open for springtime solace during crisis\n, \nUK nature reserves stay open for springtime solace during crisis\n, With many activities halted by coronavirus, benefits of time spent in nature still available, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nThu 19 Mar 2020 06.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 19 Mar 2020 13.35 EDT\n\n, The Wildlife Trusts, National Trust and RSPB have assured the public that their nature reserves remain open for people to walk in and enjoy as nature springs into life., Research shows that time spent in nature is beneficial for mental and physical health, and current government advice on coronavirus is that people without symptoms or health vulnerabilities can go for a walk outdoors if they stay the recommended two metres away from others., People have been using the hashtags #everydaywildlife and #solaceinnature on Twitter to share uplifting images. Hetty Upton, an outreach officer at the University of Exeter, tweeted: “Tadpoles in my pond are clearly ignoring mass gathering restrictions!”, Research shows that nature is good for our health &amp; wellbeing, so I am enjoying a garden stroll when I need a screen break whilst working at home.

Whether you watch long-tailed tits seek out nesting spots or stop and notice violets, these moments can bring joy and help relieve stress.”, All of the National Trust’s nature reserves are open, as well as gardens and parklands where there is sufficient space for people to walk separately, and entrance fees have been waived. However, houses, cafes and shops will all close by Friday., “The National Trust was founded 125 years ago for the benefit of the entire nation. We want to honour our mission: to enable people and nature to thrive,” said its director general, Hilary McGrady., The RSPB has 220 nature reserves and said it was keeping as many of them open as possible for as long as possible, with car parking charges waived, though all visitor centres, cafes and shops are now closed., “Nature has a remarkable way of restoring calm,” Beccy Speight, the charity’s chief executive, said in a statement. “As I write this, I can hear songbirds calling and see a pair of blue tits in my garden getting busy nest building – clear signs of spring and of wildlife busying itself in readiness to raise chicks.”, English Heritage has closed all its staffed sites but its free-to-enter sites remain open. “England’s past is full of stories of hope in the face of adversity,” said its chief executive, Kate Mavor. Similar decisions have been made by the equivalent organisations in Scotland and Wales., Prof John Middleton, president of the Association of Schools of Public Health in Europe, said people observing the government guidelines should go for a walk. “It is absolutely essential for people’s mental health and should be perfectly safe as well,” he said. “There is a lot of evidence that exercise in a green environment is better for people’s physical and mental health, instead of exercising indoors.”, Research published last year showed that a two-hour dose of nature a week significantly boosted people’s health and wellbeing, even if they simply sat and enjoyed the peace. The University of Essex’s study found that volunteers on wildlife projects benefited from a big boost to their mental health., The government’s current guidelines on social distancing say that anyone with symptoms or in poor health should not leave their home. For the rest of the population it says: “You can go for a walk outdoors if you stay more than two metres from others.”, Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “While self-isolation and social distancing are both vital measures to help combat the spread of Covid-19, they could inevitably have repercussions on people’s health due to inactivity and the impact of loneliness. Getting out and about is something that should benefit people’s physical and mental health and wellbeing.”, The Wildlife Trusts said those unable to venture far from home could still benefit from nature by downloading identification sheets to spot wildlife from a window or putting up bird feeders., Others are sharing images, videos and poems of nature online. Hannah Kwaja, a field conservation assistant at Chester Zoo, tweeted: “Lunchtime leg stretch down to the river … listening to the birdsong, watching cormorants and herons fish is bliss.” , The Wildlife Trusts, National Trust and RSPB recommend people check online for opening information about specific sites.uk nature reserves stay open for springtime solace during crisis", "label": 0}, "train-527": {"text": "\nInside the DRC’s safe haven for endangered primates\n, Inside the DRC’s safe haven for endangered primates, The Democratic Republic of the Congo is home to some of the world’s most biodiverse locations, but conflict and poaching are a constant threat.

Many farmers have already begun planting or harvesting key crops., “We must recognise that farmers’ supply of labour is in jeopardy,” said the CLA’s president, Mark Bridgeman. “A shortage of 80,000 workers is something we have never seen before. That is why we are calling for a land army of employees to support farmers in feeding the country.”, He said workers from other sectors hit hard by the coronavirus crisis could be quickly retrained to do agricultural work. “We need urgent government assistance to help source workers and advertise positions,” he said. “Time is of the essence. If we fail to find these key workers, businesses will go bust.”, The National Farmers’ Union also called on the government to act urgently. “Growers who rely on seasonal workers to pick, pack and grade our fruit and vegetables are extremely concerned about their ability to recruit workers this year,” a spokesperson said., “The industry is already working hard to promote roles on farms locally, recognising that this could help those who unfortunately find themselves out of work. We are urging the government to address this situation as soon as possible.”, The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on Friday announced a new £6m fund for farmers after the wet winter, and the relaxation of some rules on what they can grow., George Eustice, the environment secretary, said: “I have seen first-hand how devastating the recent floods have been to people and communities, which is why we have extended the farming recovery fund to help those affected get back on their feet., “I’m also aware that the spread of the coronavirus is causing other difficulties for the farming community. We are exploring all options to ensure the right support is available in the coming weeks and months.”, Demand from supermarkets and for vegetable boxes has rocketed as the coronavirus crisis intensifies, but demand from restaurants has collapsed. This has left many farmers facing difficulties in finding new supply routes and adapting to the shift. Spring is often when farm income is lowest, even while demand for labour is growing., The average age of farmers in the UK is 59, putting many in at higher risk of developing severe symptoms if they contract the virus. , The Landworkers’ Alliance, a small union representing more than 1,000 small and medium-scale farmers and land workers across the UK, called on the government to support small farmers through small business relief, even though they do not normally pay rates. The alliance also wants a “dig for victory” programme to encourage market gardeners and local community groups., Its campaigns coordinator, Jyoti Fernandes, said: “This crisis highlights the vulnerability of our globalised food system, which in coming years will only get worse if we don’t invest in building a resilient, diverse, local food system. We demand immediate and significant government action to ensure everyone can access healthy affordable food.”, Ashley Wheeler, a salad and vegetable grower in Devon, said: “What we need is help to coordinate the distribution of the food that farmers and growers have to local communities, especially those who are vulnerable and in isolation.”farmers call for land army to sustain uk food production during coronavirus crisis", "label": 0}, "train-530": {"text": "\nExtinction Rebellion protesters stay away from court over Covid-19 fears\n, One defendant did not attend hearing into last year’s protests as she was self-isolating, PA Media, \n\nFri 20 Mar 2020 13.04 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 20 Mar 2020 13.20 EDT\n\n, Dozens of Extinction Rebellion protesters failed to attend their court hearings after the campaign group told them to stay away due to the coronavirus crisis., Forty-nine people were due to appear at City of London magistrates court on Friday charged in connection with a series of environmental demonstrations held in the capital last October., However, only one defendant attended their hearing after Extinction Rebellion told the defendants not to travel due to concerns about the spread of Covid-19., Some court staff wore face masks and medical gloves during the morning, but these were later removed when it became apparent almost all the defendants would not be attending., In the majority of cases, pleas were entered either by post or through lawyers., A spokesman for Extinction Rebellion said: “We’ve been really concerned about large numbers of people coming into London, maybe getting infected and taking their virus back to their communities, so we advised them to stay away and arranged for lawyers to represent them.”, Elizabeth Garrett, who is charged with the wilful obstruction of a highway, told the court in writing she could not attend due to being in self-isolation, but pleaded guilty to the offence., Prosecutor Dami Eniola said Garrett, 22, from Brighton, was “glued to other protesters” during a demonstration at Oxford Circus on 18 October., In her submitted mitigation statement, which was read out by district judge Alexander Jacobs, Garrett said she took “full responsibility” for her actions, which were carried out to highlight pollution levels in London., She was given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £85 in costs., Retired counsellor Cathrine Sutcliffe, 70, and Terrance Sutcliffe, 67, also pleaded guilty by post to wilfully obstructing a road in Millbank on 8 October., Eniola said both defendants, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, were “sat together on a large tarp in the middle of the road” during an Extinction Rebellion demonstration before they were arrested., In a mitigation statement read out in court, Cathrine Sutcliffe, who has no previous convictions, said: “I have never done anything like this before.

One of Norfolk’s biggest populations is close to both the NDR and its proposed extension, the Western Link. All bats and their roosts are protected by law., In the original report, Packman warned that the Western Link “has significant potential to negatively impact” the barbastelle colony in the Wensum valley., In the rewritten version of the report, which was revised by environmental consultants Mott Macdonald, all discussion of the Western Link road was removed. Despite protests by Packman, Mott Macdonald submitted the revised version of the report to Norfolk county council, which later published it online., Packman later conducted an independent survey of woods through which the Western Link will pass. She said there was a large maternity roost of barbastelle bats in a wood that would be bisected by the new road, which council surveys had not revealed., A further report found that mitigation carried out by the council to sustain bat populations close to the NDR, including seven bat gantries – bridge-like structures supposed to guide bats safely over new highways – costing £1m, and a £1.2m green bridge, was largely ineffective., According to national guidelines, at least 90% of bats should be flying at a safe height within five metres of the bat bridge, and population levels should be similar to those recorded before construction. But more than 40% of bats were crossing at unsafe heights, the green bridge was used by just 13 bats and no bats used a bat underpass because it was flooded., In a statement, Mott Macdonald said: “The original report provided by our subconsultant contained information that was outside of the scope of the original commission, in that it referenced the Norwich Western Link (NWL), rather than the operational Norwich Northern Distributor Road (NDR)., “A revised report relating to NDR was prepared that removed the out-of-scope information so that it met the original client brief. However, recognising the usefulness of the out-of-scope information to the client’s future NWL scheme, we provided this to the council.”, A spokesperson for Norfolk county council confirmed it was fully aware of “the relevant survey details” relating to threats to barbastelle bat colonies posed by the Western Link. Mott Macdonald is not undertaking environmental surveys for the new road., Of the barbastelle bat colony discovered on the proposed route of the Western Link, the council said it would “welcome sight of this data” and added: “Bats and barbastelle bats in particular are known to switch roosts on a very frequent basis, and we will continue to conduct surveys to further inform our work and provide up-to-date information ahead of submitting the planning application.”, The council confirmed it would not be building any bat gantries for the new road but it planned to install green bridges and bat underpasses., Packman has launched a crowdfunder for a comprehensive independent bat survey of the area affected by the Western Link., Fiona Matthews, professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex, said bat gantries were now seen as greenwashing, with scientific evidence repeatedly showing that expensive bat mitigation for new roads did not work., She said: “Over and over again we’re getting these sorts of reports. We need some really serious effort to make these bat crossings more effective, or just decide that this is not an effective use of money for conservation. We need to think about other measures to stop these developments having a negative impact on the bat population – there are lots of other ways you could spend money on bat conservation effectively.”, David Pett of the Stop the Wensum Link campaign said the new road failed to meet Britain’s legal obligations to prevent habitat loss and climate change. “The habitat regulations assessment of the plan says the road must not adversely affect the integrity of the River Wensum special area of conservation. Even before the discovery of the barbastelle roosts this set a high bar, unlikely to be met. Also, the road would add to carbon emissions and it has not been assessed against the Paris agreement. We expect this to be a showstopper in the future for such high-carbon transport schemes after the recent Heathrow judgment.”norfolk road report rewritten to remove warning of risk to bats", "label": 0}, "train-533": {"text": "\n'Nature is taking back Venice': wildlife returns to tourist-free city\n, With the cruise ships gone and the souvenir stalls closed, the coronavirus lockdown has transformed La Serenissima’s waterways, \nJohn Brunton in Venice, \n\nFri 20 Mar 2020 06.34 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 9 Apr 2020 07.38 EDT\n\n, Look down into the waters of the Venice canals today and there is a surprising sight – not just a clear view of the sandy bed, but shoals of tiny fish, scuttling crabs and multicoloured plant-life., “The water is blue and clear,” said Gloria Beggiato, who owns the celebrated Metropole Hotel a few steps from St Mark’s square and has a view over the Venice lagoon. “It is calm like a pond, because there are no more waves caused by motorised boats transporting day-tripper tourists. And of course, the giant cruise ships have disappeared.”, Under Venice’s strict rules of self-confinement to prevent the spread of the coronavirus – all journeys but a trip to walk the dog or buy food are forbidden – the ancient city has been transformed almost overnight., La Serenissima’s hundreds of canals have been emptied of speeding motorboat taxis, transport and tourist boats. The chugging vaporetti water buses now run on a reduced timetable. Even most of the gondolas are moored., The clarity of the water has improved dramatically. Cormorants have returned to dive for fish they can now see. At the Piazzale Roma vaporetto stop, ducks have even made a nest. “Someone has put up a sign saying, ‘Don’t tread on the duck eggs,’’” Beggiato said. “All totally unimaginable a while ago.”, As the death toll from coronavirus in Italy outstrips that of China, the government of Giuseppe Conte has tried to keep citizens at home using a mix of social media and police controls., But locals are still moving about cautiously to do their daily shopping – except now in a city without visitors. It is a remarkable transformation for a city that until recently saw protests against overtourism under the No Grande Navi (“No more cruise ships”) slogan., At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance., In a queue to buy fish at his local fishmonger in Canareggio, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: “When I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.”, “For the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?” said Franco Folin, a fisherman. “But when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited – there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.”, The apparent cleanliness of the water is not in fact due to a lack of pollution, said Davide Tagliapetra, an environmental researcher at the Institute of Marine Science. He told a local TV station that the reason is the absence of motorised transport, which normally churns up the muddy canal floor., Matteo Bisol runs the vineyard restaurant Venissa on the tiny lagoon island of Mazzorbo, and has been campaigning for a more eco-responsible, sustainable model of tourism in Venice for some time., “For goodness sake, it is not surprising there are fish in the canals of Venice,” he said. “If there were not, then we should all be worried as the lagoon here is a fragile ecosystem. People need to realise that if we control and cut down boat traffic in Venice and its lagoon then we could all discover a unique biosphere.”, It is not just the cruise ships that are gone: the souvenir stalls that line the Riva degli Schiavoni, the Murano glass and lace shops, and the bars and restaurants are all closed., It is a brutal hit to an economy that relies on tourism, but in the meantime locals appear to be rediscovering their city, in an admittedly constrained way., “We Venetians have the feeling that nature has returned and is taking back possession of the city,” said Beggiato., “If you ask me today – sunny blue skies, clear canals – then, yes, we would all like Venice to stay like this for a while. But we need, and look forward to, the return of tourists, though maybe not the 20 million a year that we have had to cope with., “I honestly believe we should take the opportunity of this lockdown to reflect and see how we can be more organised in the future to find a balance between the city and tourism.”, This article was amended on 20 March 2020 because an earlier version contained a tweet which was subsequently found to contain incorrect claims.

As Mexico’s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed., Simultaneously Calderón also began pursuing the so-called “kingpin strategy” by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders., That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps – notably Arturo Beltrán Leyva who was gunned down by Mexican marines in 2009 – but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie., Under Calderón’s successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, the government’s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world’s most murderous mafia groups., But Calderón’s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa’s Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán., When “El Chapo” was arrested in early 2016, Mexico’s president bragged: “Mission accomplished”. But the violence went on. By the time Peña Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain., The leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics. López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, vowed to attack the social roots of crime, offering vocational training to more than 2.3 million disadvantaged young people at risk of being ensnared by the cartels., “It will be virtually impossible to achieve peace without justice and social welfare,” Amlo said, promising to slash the murder rate from an average of 89 killings per day with his “hugs not bullets” doctrine., Amlo also pledged to chair daily 6am security meetings and create a 60,000 strong \"National Guard\". But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants., Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office., The situation for defenders was exacerbated by energy reforms in 2013, since when scores of renewable energy mega-projects have been imposed on rural and indigenous communities without adequate consultation or compensation., Almost one in three attacks since 2012 targeted defenders opposing energy projects, especially wind and hydroelectric power, according to the Mexican Centre for Environmental Rights (known by its Spanish acronym, Cemda)., “The data shows persistent structural violence against defenders of environmental rights in our country, which prevents them having the freedom and security to exercise their right to defend human rights,” said a spokesperson for Cemda, which tracks attacks against communities opposing projects threatening forests, water sources and land rights., The violence is spread across the country, but defenders in the southern state of Oaxaca have faced most attacks over the past eight years., Oaxaca, one of the country’s poorest states with the highest proportion of indigenous peoples, is rich in natural resources such as minerals, rivers, forests and natural gas. The violence has been particularly marked in the biodiverse isthmus of Tehuantepec – a narrow land mass between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean where 28 mega wind farms now generate electricity., The overall number of attacks in 2019 was the lowest since 2012. Nevertheless, 15 defenders were murdered and at least 25 others were threatened, harassed or subjected to smear campaigns., This included the double murder of the indigenous Tarahumara defender Otilia Martínez Cruz and her son, Gregorio Chaparro Cruz, who were shot dead on 1 May 2019 – a year after another family member, Julián Carrillo, was killed., More than a dozen Tarahumara defenders have been killed in recent years for trying to stop the illegal deforestation of their ancestral land in the Sierra Madre, a biodiverse mountain range in northern Mexico. They include Isidro Baldenegro López, winner of the prestigious Goldman environmental prize, who was shot dead in 2017. The forests have long been targeted by illegal loggers abetted by corrupt officials and landowners., In 2019, state officials such as police officers, national guard and local prosecutors, were responsible for 40% of incidents registered by Cemda.mexico environment land defenders murdered rights indigenous", "label": 0}, "train-535": {"text": "\nWhy not encourage cycling during the coronavirus lockdown?\n, Bikes allows people to maintain isolation but provide important respite from being indoors, \nPeter Walker, \n\nFri 20 Mar 2020 03.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Apr 2020 06.47 EDT\n\n, It’s an increasingly urgent question for those who still have to travel into work, or to collect supplies or visit vulnerable people – how can you get around without contracting – or spreading – the coronavirus? One answer could be cycling., The immediate caveat to mention is that this is not a call for every trip to be made by bike. If you’re going 25 miles at night to collect 50kg of supplies for a food bank … well, you could do it with a cargo bike, but for most people it’s a non-starter., But with more than a third of trips in the UK under two miles, and more than 60% of them less than five miles, the scope is there, particularly in urban areas, for many more one person trips to be made by bike (or, indeed, on foot for shorter trips)., So why cycle? The coronavirus-specific paradox of a bike is that it simultaneously gets you out onto the streets, in touch with fresh air, the changing springtime climate, and other people, but it’s very rare to be in over-close proximity to others. Even at a rush-hour traffic light in a city, you can almost always stake out a metre or two of your own, away from other riders and drivers., Cycling for everyday transport has not so far been restricted outside places which have imposed hugely draconian containment measures, like China. While Italy and Spain have placed temporary bans on leisure cycling, riding a bike for permitted everyday travel is officially allowed, albeit with reports of some over-zealous police enforcement., On Thursday, the chief executive of British Cycling, Julie Harrington, wrote to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, urging ministers to add cycling to their list of recommended activities during the outbreak., Earlier this week, a group of nearly 50 academics and experts on public health and transport wrote an open letter to the government, urging ministers to not discourage walking and cycling amid the pandemic, noting their vital importance in the wider public health issue of combating inactivity., During any lockdown, “all of our existing social and health risks do not simply go away”, they wrote., The letter added: “In a rapidly escalating situation, policy could be adopted that largely confines the general asymptomatic population to their homes, potentially for some time. Confinement, sometimes in overcrowded accommodation with little or no private green space, and particularly during times of anxiety has health risks.”, This makes perfect sense. Coronavirus is a very obvious health crisis, and could – at the best-case predictions – kill quite a few thousand Britons., But the longer-term, more normalised health consequences of people living excessively inactive and sedentary lives – everything from type 2 diabetes to cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer – is one of the leading causes of early death around the world, every year., Precise figures are hard to estimate, but one often-quoted statistic suggests that in England alone, 80,000-plus people die early every year due to the health consequences of inactivity., Rather than impeding cycle use, governments should use the coronavirus crisis to make it easier, particularly in cities, so people can avoid public transport. It would take a matter of hours to cone-off lanes to create temporary bike routes so more people could ride safely. The Colombian capital, Bogotá, has already begun to do this., I’d also strongly argue against any bans on recreational and leisure cycling, which is so good for both physical and mental health. The rationale for these appears to be to take the strain off health services, in case a cyclist is injured and needs treatment., This approaches the issue from the wrong way. Cycling is an inherently safe form of transport where the danger is almost all external – that is, from drivers and other motor vehicle users. If the intention really is to prevent road casualties, then the best way, surely, would be to reduce speed limits, and urge careful driving., This could be made into a coherent approach. So, for example, big cities could impose blanket 20mph speed limits – I’d personally go for 15mph – with space set aside on major roads for cycle use. With so many people working from or confined to home, in many cities traffic levels are falling, even with public transport off limits. This would also make walking more appealing., One of the many effects of the pandemic has been falls in emission levels in many cities, as cars stay at home. Some have even speculated that in some countries, the death toll from coronavirus could be significantly offset by fewer people dying as a result of air pollution., Around the world, governments are taking actions which, even a few weeks ago, they would have dismissed as fantasy. Boris Johnson’s government is currently not dismissing the idea of introducing a universal basic income, an idea which, when raised by the Greens in 2017, was viewed by the Conservatives with derision., So why not make cycling easier, not more difficult? At one stroke, you have people kept distanced during transport, and making them healthier in the long term – not to mention more likely to be able to see off respiratory infections like Covid-19., It could be time for action.why not encourage cycling during the coronavirus lockdown", "label": 0}, "train-536": {"text": "\nCountry diary: yellowhammers woo their mates with a local song\n, Lambert’s Castle, Dorset: The hedgerows near the iron age fort provide useful cover for birds whose habitat is diminishing, \nSara Hudston, \n\nFri 20 Mar 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n, A raven greets me at the gateway, a tutelary spirit flying low overhead. I’m on the southern path, steep and stony, edged with castles of leggy gorse. As I climb, the sun rises rose-gold, netted in the twigs of an oak silhouetted on the ridge above., This part of the hill is a mosaic of heath, grass, bracken and bramble, punctuated with mature pedunculate oaks and grazed by cattle. Last year the area was cut back in places to encourage bell heather. Now the cleared areas are studded with green rosettes of seedling foxgloves, ready to rocket upwards. By July they will have formed thickets of magenta tridents., A greater spotted woodpecker drums insistently in the thread of woodland below, matched by the leaping laugh of a green woodpecker yaffling through the scrub. Nearby, a female yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) hops about the undergrowth while two males contend for a singing perch, their zinging canary-lemon heads matching the gorse flowers in brilliance., Yellowhammers are surprisingly well camouflaged, despite their vivid plumage. They have a distinctive song, a fast, scissoring “che-che-che-che-che-and-wheeze” that the children’s author Enid Blyton characterised as “a little bit of bread and no cheese”., About half the time, these two males either don’t mention cheese, or else they sing the final, long note so quietly and lightly that it becomes a faint, plaintive cry. This is because they are singing in Dorset dialect. Citizen science projects in Europe and New Zealand discovered that yellowhammers have slightly different ways of ending the song depending on their region. Females prefer males who share their dialect., It’s a treat to hear them. Yellowhammers are one of several species to have vanished from most of the Marshwood Vale, largely due to farming practices. They need thick, sheltering hedges with untidy bases that provide plenty of cover. While the vale has miles of ancient hedgerows, most are flailed twice a year, reducing them to neat but inhospitable sticks., Lambert’s Castle is a designated site of special scientific interest, and managed accordingly. In the iron age it was a fort where people perhaps retreated in times of crisis. Now it’s providing a refuge for non-human species.country diary yellowhammers woo their mates with a local song", "label": 0}, "train-537": {"text": "\nTaxi! Endangered New Zealand seabirds get a lift to safety after crash landing in fog\n, Volunteer army led by a local taxi driver scours the streets in the middle of the night to save endangered birds, \nEleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin, \n\nThu 19 Mar 2020 22.57 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 20 Mar 2020 11.55 EDT\n\n, A taxi driver in New Zealand has swapped drunken revellers for wayward seabirds in an attempt to halt the decline of one of the nation’s endangered species., Local cabbie Toni Painting leads a volunteer army that scours the streets of the South Island town of Kaikoura in the middle of the night in search of Hutton’s shearwater chicks that crash-land onto the road – mistaking the shiny bitumen for the sea., Painting was the first to spot the seabird chicks dazed and confused around town on foggy nights five years ago. Now she patrols each evening in fledgling season, collecting the wayward birds and delivering them to a nearby rehabilitation centre, who then take them out to sea., Hutton’s shearwater are the only seabird in the world that nests and raises its young in the mountains, at heights around 1200m. Since the 1960s their breeding colonies have reduced from eight to two, classifying them for “endangered” status by the Department of Conservation., Experts think the fledgling chicks in Kaikoura are confusing black, shiny bitumen for the surface of the ocean on their first journeys out of their nest, especially on foggy, moonless nights., Once they have crash-landed the birds are unable to walk on land, or move, and often get hit by vehicles, or eaten by roaming cats or dogs., “I go out half an hour after dark. Then I go out every hour until half past midnight, it takes them half an hour to get down from the mountains,” said Painting, who keeps animal boxes in her taxi to hold the chicks, which are fluffy, heavy and grey., “If there’s a lot of birds coming down I can go all night, if I have passengers they’ll help me too.”, On an average night during fledgling season, which runs through March and April, between 10 and 20 birds will be found on local Kaikoura roads, especially those bordering the coast., Painting said on her busiest night more than 200 birds were rescued, with volunteers working through till dawn., Ted Howard is the chairman of the Hutton’s Shearwater Charitable Trust. He says the local Kaikoura community was well-used to the birds’ antics now, and on any given night about a dozen volunteers would be out patrolling the roads., The highest death toll was 12 dead shearwaters in one night, which Howard said was “a tragedy” as the birds were so rare., “We call them crash-landers – they really are fascinating and strange birds; they’re the only seabird on the planet that breeds in the high mountains,” Howard said., “The most risky nights are when it’s moonless, damp and misty.”, Erica Wilkinson, threatened species ambassador for the department of conservation, said volunteer efforts such as those in Kaikoura were “absolutely critical” to saving New Zealand’s threatened bird population, which continues to be decimated by introduced species such as rats, possums and stoats., “Reversing the decline of our biodiversity really does take a village, and successes and innovation like this show that when we work together we can turn things around,” Wilkinson said., Once the birds have been rehabilitated they are taken out on dolphin watching boats and released over the water., For Painting this week marks the beginning of a month of late, cold nights, but there’s nothing that makes her happier than cruising the streets at midnight, her eyes peeled for that chubby puff of grey blinking in the dark., “I just love birds and I know they’re threatened so it was on my heart to help save the species,” Painting says., “They’re lovely birds, they’re easy to pick up and release.

Now the tree-ferns were re-sprouting but the sassafras had been killed., “We didn’t see a single one that had survived,” Blakers said. “A lot of the biggest eucalypts are gone too, either toppled in the fire or undermined so that they will fall in a storm. These were the best homes for owls and gliders.”, The fire appeared to have hit sheltered southern slopes and exposed northern slopes equally hard. “Wildlife wouldn’t have had a chance,” he said. “The forest now is terribly silent.”, The unprecedented fire season struck shortly after the Andrews government announced what it described as “the largest environmental protection policy in the state’s history”., Andrews said 90,000 hectares of old-growth forest would be immediately protected, and a further 96,000 hectares of native forest set aside to save the greater glider, a marsupial that has seen its habitat sharply reduced by development, forestry and fire. Half of the latter was in the Gippsland fire-affected area., The premier said timber supply agreements would be extended to 2024, at which point a $120m support package for exiting businesses and thousands of affected workers would kick in. All native forest logging would end by 2030, when there was expected to be an extra 50,000 hectares of plantation timber., The announcement was strongly opposed by the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union, which has hundreds of members in the timber industry, and was attacked by Bridget McKenzie, the then federal agriculture minister, who said it was “casting aside an entire industry and workforce”., Andrews said the native timber supply had already reduced significantly, down about 50% in a decade, and that a large bushfire might hasten the industry’s end. He reiterated that warning on ABC radio as the fires burned in January. “We’ve said for a while now that the sustainability of this industry could be directly impacted by a significant fire event and that’s exactly what’s happened here,” he said., Chris Shuringa, of the Goongerah Environment Centre, said the affected areas were ancient, fire-intolerant rainforests that had survived ice ages and needed centuries to recover, something they were unlikely to get as climate change increased the risk of repeat fires., She urged the government to protect remaining pockets of unburnt forest while bringing forward a transition plan for the forestry industry, with assistance for workers and businesses. “The Andrews government must act now to protect remaining pockets of unburnt habitat and give wildlife the best chance of recovery,” she said., The centre was one of seven environment groups that wrote to Andrews in January calling for an immediate response to the fires, including rewriting a greater glider action statement, expanding protected area immediately and other steps to protect burnt and unburnt forests., An initial government assessment of the bushfire damage in Victoria found more than 25% of the state’s greater glider habitat and 70% of its warm temperate rainforest may have burned., The government promised $17.5m for biodiversity recovery over the first six months and its timber agency, VicForests, temporarily voided some east Gippsland logging contracts after the fires., In response to questions on Friday, a Victorian government spokesman said it was still “working through the impact on wildlife and biodiversity of the recent bushfires”.the forest is now terribly silent land set aside for threatened species entirely burnt out", "label": 0}, "train-540": {"text": "\nRare Andean bears flock to cloud forest to feast on wild avocados\n, \nRare Andean bears flock to cloud forest to feast on wild avocados\n, The real-life Paddington bears were in decline across South America, but records suggest their numbers are growing in Ecuador, \nKaren McVeigh, \n\nSat 21 Mar 2020 04.00 EDT\n\n, Deep in the Maquipucuna cloud forest, two hours drive from Ecuador’s capital, Quito, rare Andean bears come together for a few weeks each year to feast on the wild avocados ripening atop mist-shrouded trees., According to ecologists, this small community is growing, bucking the trend of a vulnerable species in decline across South America. The gathering, similar to those of grizzly bears at salmon rivers in Alaska and Canada, is turning what experts know about this normally reclusive, solitary creature on its head., “Throughout the Andes, because of habitat loss, we would expect to see a population in decline,” said Rebeca Justicia, a conservationist and co-founder of the Maquipucuna Foundation and reserve. “But locally we have seen a spike in the population. We are even seeing mothers with cubs, which is very unusual.”, There are believed to be fewer than 10,000 of these bears left across the northern Andes. Listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature red list, they face an increasingly uncertain future due to habitat destruction and hunting., Justicia set up the Maquipucuna Foundation with her husband, Rodrigo Ontaneda, 30 years ago. They were instrumental in persuading many local communities to stop ranching and timber farming and lobbied for protection of the wider Chocó-Andino Pichincha region, which was finally declared a Unesco biosphere reserve in 2018., “When we started our project, it was very hard to see a bear,” said Justicia. “We heard, anecdotally, there were bears here and that people hunted them.”, Andean or spectacled bears, which have earned global attention thanks to the fictional Paddington Bear, are hunted for parts used in the international wildlife trade – gall bladders, used in oriental medicine, can fetch as much as $150 (£116) and there is a large market in Ecuador for bear paws., Justicia spotted her first Andean bear in 2008. Since then, she says, she has recorded 40 different bears, based on photographs taken in the 6,500-hectare (16,061-acre) Maquipucuna reserve, identifying individuals from unique facial markings. Other experts have counted up to 19 bears in the forest in a single year., We still don’t know how the bears decided to come to Maquipucuna. But we are learning more and more every year, “We see an unusually high number of bears during the wild avocado season because they congregate around this abundant source of food,” said Justicia. “The small avocados have very large quantities of fat and oil and that is hard to get in a vegetarian diet. They can come and feed for weeks.”, Little is known about these creatures. Their chosen territory, in dense cloud forest and the high Andes, the fact they may cover up to 10km in a single day, as well as their timid and solitary natures, makes them difficult to study., But the bear gatherings are helping ecologists understand more about them. Two Andean bears from Maquipucuna, filmed in 2017, were recently featured in BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet series, climbing trees to get at the fruit., “Generally, all bears are solitary,” said Justicia. “The first year we realised this place was different was in 2008. The next year, it went crazy, we saw females with cubs. One February we realised how many bears came together and we began to record them.”, Each Andean bear needs around 1,000 hectares of territory, so the reserve itself would only support six individuals., Justicia compares the gatherings to those of Alaskan grizzlies that come together at salmon rivers. The bears arrive in the dry months, from September to December, but it is unpredictable, because the avocados do not ripen at the same time every year., Five years ago, people did not believe there were bears in this area, in the Quito corridor, “We still don’t know how the bears decided to come to Maquipucuna,” said Justicia. “But we are learning more and more every year.”, Santiago Molina, a bear expert from San Francisco University of Quito, has carried out his own study of bear numbers in a 65,000-hectare region within the metropolitan district of Quito. His analysis of camera traps has led to an estimate of around 65 bears in the entire region, an area including Maquipucuna but 10 times the size. , Molina is sceptical of the numbers recorded by Justicia, although he recorded 19 bears in the reserve in one season in 2009 and said 15 were spotted within two months in 2017 inside the reserve boundaries., He is both excited and worried about the rising numbers of what he describes as “Quito’s bears”. The proximity to human populations brings its own dangers., “This is new,” said Molina, whose work led to the creation of the Andean Bear Corridor, or Corredor del Oso Andino, by the Quito government to protect the bears’ habitat. “It is changing the whole concept of bears. Five years ago, people did not believe there were bears in this area, in the Quito corridor. Before, the bears we studied were in the highlands, the grasslands, not forests, and bears were known to be solitary animals.”, Those bears living in the forest exhibit different behaviour from highland bears, he said. They are known to hunt, dispelling the myth they are mostly vegetarian., “I have video of a bear hunting a deer – that was a myth for years,” said Molina. “I suspect most of the bears living here have already tasted meat, from feeding on meat left around, for instance when a cow dies. Bears have good scents and are very opportunistic.”, “Now we hear of bear-human conflicts. It is a population under threat,” he added., He is starting a project in the Yunguilla community, with the international association for bear research and management, to help farmers reduce the chance of bears coming into contact with their cattle and crops., “We have an opportunity to address this.

Today, we saw extreme levels of bleaching on coastal reefs from Lockhart River to Cairns. Mid-shelf reefs in this region have variable levels of bleaching, from mild to severe pic.twitter.com/QdN16S0cV3, In February, average sea surface temperatures on the reef were 1.25C above normal and the highest on record going back to 1900. Scientists have said the world’s oceans are gathering heat due to accumulating levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mostly from burning fossil fuels., Corals bleach if they sit in unusually hot water for too long. Survival from bleaching depends on how high and for how long temperatures get. Some species of corals have higher tolerance for heat than others., Observations of conditions on the reef from satellites and in-water temperature loggers suggest central and southern parts have accumulated high levels of hat stress., But the authority said the full picture would only come clear once the aerial surveys were completed at the end of this week, and the data had been analysed., In 2016 and 2017, the world heritage reef experienced back to-back bleaching that was intense enough to kill almost half the reef’s corals over those two years., Central and southern parts of the reef were not severely impacted in those years, meaning they are not used to the heat stress and could be harder hit., Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, spent 17 hours across four days in the air last week scoring bleaching on reefs with a staff member from the authority., After completing the first four of nine days of aerial surveys, Hughes told Guardian Australia most of the severe bleaching had been seen at coastal reefs., On Friday, flying from Lockhart River to Cairns, Hughes said corals at Princess Charlotte Bay at the bottom of the Cape York Peninsula had been severely bleached, but the impacts were much less on reefs further away from the coast., Many of the outer reefs in the north – known as “ribbon reefs” because of their slim and snaking appearance from above – had escaped bleaching., Hughes said: “A lot of the reefs we have been looking at were badly affected in 2016 and 2017. They don’t have a lot of corals on them and the corals that are there have managed to survive 2016 and 2017, and so they are tough.”, Hughes said it “remains to be seen what will happen in the south” but there were more coral species in those areas – including staghorn and table acroporas – that would be more susceptible to bleaching., Some of those central and southern reefs “have accumulated a lot of heat, particularly near the coast,” he said. “This is shaping up to be strongly coastal – 2016 and 2017 were cooler in the south and, this time around, it is not cool in the south.”, Hughes said: “Even if it turns out to be a relative moderate event event compared to 16 and 17, it is still cumulative and because the footprints are different, the cumulative amounts of the reef that’s affected severely or moderately will go up.”, Townsville-based Dr William Skirving, of the US government’s Coral Reef Watch program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the agency’s analysis showed how localised the heat stress had been. But whether that heat stress had translated to severe bleaching would be be answered by the aerial surveys., He said according to his agency’s analysis, one area of Swains Reefs off Townsville had showed some of the highest levels of heat stress across the entire reef, but some of the lowest levels had also been in the same group., This was one reason, he said, why the aerial surveys were important. He held concerns for the corals in southern areas., He said: “Let’s cross our fingers that the corals were not as susceptible as they were in the past.”, Wachenfeld told Guardian Australia that whatever the final assessment was “these are still significant events that are sounding a very loud alarm bell about what’s happening to the reef in the face of climate change.”, He said there had been reports of “at least moderate bleaching” from Magnetic Island, near Townsville, and Heron Island, off Gladstone., “Bleaching does not necessarily mean death and that some people do misunderstand that,” he said. “Yes, the reef is in trouble, but what that means is that it needs more help.”, Aerial surveys this week of the Ribbon Reefs, above Cairns, show little to no bleaching. Aerial surveys continue over the coming days in areas that experienced more heat stress. #GreatBarrierReef #video pic.twitter.com/4cdjpbj4ZE, Wachenfeld said whatever the final detailed assessment of the severity of this summer’s bleaching revealed, this needed to be seen in the context of the broader challenges the reef was facing, including the ongoing impacts from climate change., He said 2016 and 2017 were “the worst events that have ever happened” for the reef, and so if this year turned out to be less severe, this should “not lull us into a false sense of security”., He said he was encouraged to hear that outer ribbon reefs in the north – which he had personally dived on many times – had seemingly escaped bleaching this summer., “They are some of the most beautiful places on the planet and so to know they have done well in this event gives me enormous hope for the future and of what we have left to protect,” he said., “There are still places that are absolutely amazing.

And things just got worse…, \n\nSun 22 Mar 2020 03.41 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 10.17 EDT\n\n, Tim Lang likes to take the long view. A conversation with the internationally renowned professor of food policy at London’s City University will roam in detail from the repeal of the Corn Laws, through Brexit and back again, the narrative seasoned with detailed facts and figures. It’s why he has been a consultant to the World Health Organization, special adviser to four House of Commons select committee inquiries and a food policy adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. So when he says in his new book, Feeding Britain, that, “although not officially at war, the UK is, de facto, facing a wartime scale of food challenge”, it’s worth paying attention. We are, he says, in serious trouble., Lang, who established the pioneering Centre for Food Policy at City University in 1994, makes no apologies for the bluntness of the statement. “I did not write that lightly,” he says, when we meet in central London. “I sat in my study, reviewing all the data. Things have just got worse.” Even so, he recognises how it looks. Panic buying aside, our supermarket shelves are usually full. We have access to a greater range of ingredients at better prices than at any time in human history. The conversation around how and what we eat often feels like it sits front and centre of the culture. “I like my food,” he says. “More joy around food has come into our lives.”, There’s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food, And yet, he says, all of that masks a bitter reality: we have a massively fragile just-in-time supply chain which could easily collapse; a depleted agriculture sector which produces only around 50% of the food we actually eat, leaving us at the mercies of the international markets; and production methods which are damaging to the environment and human health. “When I looked at the numbers on inequality,” he says, “I was shocked. There’s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food.” As he says: “Food is the biggest driver of NHS spending as a result of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.” Food may look cheap, he adds, but too much of it creates vast, unsustainable costs elsewhere., His doorstep of a book attempts both diagnosis and cure. Consciously, it pushes the impact of Brexit to one side to get at the underlying dysfunction. Likewise, we agree to discuss the implications of coronavirus later. Nevertheless, he says, it all amounts to the same thing. “There is a mismatch between human need, the food system and its outcomes.”, At the heart of this crisis is a British willingness to let a small number of corporations dominate food retailing: just eight companies control 90% of our food supply. “It’s the ‘leave it to Tesco’ approach,” he says. The prioritisation of price has hollowed out UK agriculture, so that primary producers get the smallest slice of the cake. “They get about 5% or 6% of the value of the food we buy. They need double that. And that 50% self-sufficiency should be nearer 80%. Not out of nationalism, but so we are in a position to contribute globally. We have a default position of assuming someone else will feed us.”, The book comes freighted with eye-popping data. For example, of the six million hectares of cultivatable land in Britain, only 168,000 hectares are used for fruit and vegetables. As a result, we have to import vast amounts of crops we could otherwise be growing. Much of the remaining land is used for crops to feed livestock or for processed foods., “The government is now so reliant on the retailers, they are setting them up to fail,” he says. “At the height of the arguments over a no-deal Brexit, the heads of the big food companies were briefing the government about just how fragile the food supply chain is. Brexit has shone a spotlight on that fragility.” I ask where he thinks this dysfunctional system has come from. “There is a culture of British exceptionalism. We were the first industrial nation in the 18th century and then became the dominant imperial power in the 19th century and pursued that as a way of feeding ourselves.” Critics often point out that we were less self-sufficient in food in the early 20th century than we are now. True, Lang says, but that was specifically because we had an empire which we ravaged to keep our tables and bellies full., He’s at pains to acknowledge that he is not the first person to raise these issues. He first became interested in the subject in the 1970s when, having just completed his social psychology PhD, he started farming in Wales. He came across a book called Our Food Problem and Its Relation to Our National Defences, published in 1939. One of its authors was Frederick Le Gros Clark, a sometime children’s writer who went on to become an expert in malnutrition. Like Lang, he argued that the British food supply chain was exceedingly delicate and was not serving the health of the nation. The outbreak of war would prove him right. There was also a review of the British food system in 1936 by William Beveridge, later architect of the welfare state, who made similar arguments. “Beveridge was totally ignored,” Lang says., When the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food, In the summer of 2019, then Defra secretary Michael Gove announced he was establishing a national food strategy, which was broadly welcomed by the food industry. He put his friend Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon healthy fast-food chain, in charge of the review, even though he has no academic credentials in the field. Lang is polite about the classic British choice of a non-expert generalist to lead the review, but he does say that he’s concerned that, like Beveridge, Dimbleby’s review will be ignored when it’s eventually published. “When the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food,” he says., What’s Lang’s solution? It’s detailed and includes the introduction of a food resilience and sustainability act, complete with legally binding targets. National nutritional guidelines should become the basis for food procurement contracts, both public and private. There should be an audit of food production in the UK and the budget for public health should be doubled from £2.5bn of the £130bn health budget to £5bn. It also proposes the creation of no fewer than nine bodies or institutions, including a royal commission to map a new set of “multi-criteria principles for the UK food system”, a food resilience and sustainability council and a network of urban and rural food and farming colleges., I suggest this is an old-fashioned 1970s corporatist approach; that he’s proposing a massive expansion of the state to deal with the problem. “I think I’ve been pretty modest,” Lang says. “The British state is failing us by not decentralising.” He also calls for Tesco, which has around 30% of the food retail market, to be broken up, so that no one firm has more than 15%. Likewise, he calls for pension funds to disinvest from manufacturers of ultra-processed foods, as some have started doing with fossil fuels. The list goes on. He insists, however, that this is not some kneejerk leftist manifesto. “We just need to re-engineer how capitalism works for us.”, We agree we can no longer ignore the viral elephant both inside the room and outside it. Might the coronavirus crisis help with the re-engineering of our food supply chain? He agrees, sadly, that it might. “It could prove a good reminder of the value of state institutions,” he says. And the emptying of shelves as a result of panic buying may help people to “think about where their food comes from”. He adds: “We need to move from a ‘me’ food culture to a ‘we’ food culture.” It’s a very simple message, but in the white heat of a crisis, defined by queues outside supermarkets, a useful one., • The headline of this article was amended on 23 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the content and context of the interview with Lang., Feeding Britain: Our Food Problems and How to Fix Them by Tim Lang is published on 26 March (Pelican, £25).

Britain will have no choice, he says, but to engage with the commercial sector in large-scale planting of imported conifers, despite fears of the impact on habitats and wildlife., Such a move risks incurring public anger, if its 20th-century precursor is anything to go by. “People felt it was bad for landscape, biodiversity and amenity,” said Healey. “Both the public and conservation professionals saw many negative effects on heathland; there was the notorious draining of the peat bogs of the Flow Country in the far north of Scotland; some really important habitats were left decimated by tree planting.”, In 2017 the UK was the second largest net importer of forest products, behind China. Yet only 1,420 hectares of woodland were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government’s target of 5,000 hectares. Wales and Northern Ireland planted 520 hectares and 240 hectares respectively., The Committee on Climate Change has called for the planting of more trees and woodlands if the UK is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It recommends increasing UK woodland cover from its current low level of 13% of total land cover to at least 17%, and possibly to 19% by 2050. In contrast, 38% of the average EU member state is wooded, a roughly similar percentage to the US., The Conservatives have pledged to plant 30 million trees a year between 2020 and 2025. But Healey said such targets faced stiff challenges. Indigenous species grow too slowly to be an efficient option for rapid carbon fixation, he said. Unharvested woodland eventually stops sequestering carbon when it reaches maturity., But conifer forests are harvested for timber, allowing new trees to be planted. He said: “The trees that produce this commercial timber and can grow in this country are virtually all non-native and are predominantly conifers from North America.”, The need to plant more trees is now an urgent priority to tackle the climate emergency. Mature tropical forests in Africa and the Amazon are slowing their rate of carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere and may soon become a source of emissions, as trees die., Healey said it was time to be pragmatic. “Many people think we can have this huge expansion of tree planting in the UK and it will all happen without costing us as the taxpayer that much money. We also think it will all be nice, native species woodland of broadleaved trees and lots of biodiversity but it’s just economically impossible.”, “People and politicians have got to face up to the fact that the vast majority of this tree planting, if it’s to occur at the scale they have talked about, is going to have to come from commercial investments, and forest and environmental policy has got to avoid getting in the way of that unnecessarily,” Healey said. “Planting is catastrophically slow in England and Wales, and many commercial investors feel that they are held back from acquiring land and converting it to woodland because of the way that the whole raft of environmental and other policy regulations are implemented.”, Many endangered species – such as curlews and lapwings – depend on open habitats like moors and heaths., “Everyone agrees that the best of these habitats should be protected,” Healey said. “But a lot of them are in really poor condition. Is restoration the best use of all this land, or should some, instead, be converted to conifer plantations or native woodlands? We need to ask how much of our heathland we need to protect or restore and how much we can convert to rapid carbon sequestration.”conifer oak britain forest change to meet climate targets", "label": 0}, "train-545": {"text": "\nConstruction of US-Mexico border wall proceeds despite coronavirus pandemic\n, The Trump administration announced plans to erect 150 miles of barrier on the border, involving large numbers of contractors, \nNina Lakhani, \n\nSun 22 Mar 2020 02.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 14.04 EDT\n\n, The Trump administration is ramping up construction of its multibillion-dollar southern border wall, despite the rapidly escalating coronavirus epidemic which threatens to kill thousands of Americans and plunge the country into economic recession., Earlier this week, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced plans to erect more than 150 miles of the 30ft border wall in Arizona, New Mexico and California – in addition to ongoing construction work at at least 15 sites across those states and Texas., The announcement came shortly after Donald Trump declared a national emergency, amid mounting criticism about his handling of the coronavirus epidemic which looks likely to cost billions – if not trillions of dollars to tackle., By Friday 19,500 cases and 260 deaths had been confirmed in the US, and tens of thousands of sacked workers had applied for unemployment benefits, as large swaths of the country implemented lockdowns in efforts to slow the spread., As medical experts and local officials implore Americans to stay at home and observe social distancing, construction crews at multiple sites continue to work, sleep and eat in close quarters., “Wall construction has not been affected,” said a CBP spokesman., Building work continues in many parts of the country, but for the wall, skilled welders, engineers and contractors commute from states as far flung as Montana, Maine, Wyoming, Texas, North Dakota and Kentucky. Along the border, they work together, car-pool, stay at local hotels and motels, and eat together at restaurants over several consecutive days, before traveling back to their families., On Friday, work continued in the San Bernardino Valley in south-east Arizona where a national wildlife refuge is located and several endangered species are threatened by the project., “There is no sign of construction slowing down, hundreds of construction workers from all over the country and Mexico continue working on the wall, commuting back and forth on weekends, staying in hotels and eating at restaurants in our communities, before returning home and potentially transferring Covid-19. This is a public health hazard and it needs to be stopped,” said Myles Traphagen, ecologist with Wildlands Network, who has written to the congressional appropriations committee urging construction be suspended during the pandemic., The army corp of engineers did not respond to questions about whether mitigation and prevention measures had been implemented., Trump promised to build a “big, beautiful wall” along the 2,000-mile southern border (and make Mexico pay for it) as part of a presidential campaign permeated by anti-immigration sentiments., Since then, the Trump administration has pledged to erect or replace 450 to 500 miles of the wall by the end of 2020, at a cost of almost $18.5bn. The vast majority of the money was diverted from the US Department of Defense, specifically from counter-drug operations and military infrastructure projects, after Trump declared a national emergency, widely seen as spurious, in February 2019 to fund the wall., The latest planned additions to the piecemeal wall construction come after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees CBP, waived a series of federal laws to speed up construction., In order to erect the 30ft-high steel barrier as fast as possible, the Guardian has received reports of workers being paid above average rates to work through the night., “The DHS is throwing billions at a monument out in the desert that will have little practical effect on migration or drug trafficking, when there’s a very real threat that needs all of our attention and resources right now,” said Adam Isacson, director of the defence oversight program at the Washington Office on Latin America (Wola). “This gives the impression that our government is on autopilot, throwing up big pharaonic, politicized projects, when right now we should be putting everything into rapid response.”, There are widespread shortages in testing kits and essential protective equipment like masks, gowns and gloves, while medical experts warn of insufficient ventilators and hospital beds to cope with the inevitable surge in sick patients., On Friday, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, announced that the Mexico-US border would be close to all non-essential travel., “It’s callous, dangerous and unacceptable for border wall construction to continue,” said Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Every government resource should be dedicated to saving lives and tackling this existential threat, rather than pulling out all the stops to make good on an election promise.”construction us mexico border wall coronavirus pandemic", "label": 0}, "train-546": {"text": "\nThe five: trees of the year\n, \nIan Tucker, \n\nSun 22 Mar 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n, Last week, a pine tree near a flooded Czech village was voted European tree of the year. Known to the locals of Chudobín as the Guardian of the Flooded Village, the tree is estimated to be 350 years old – the villagers attribute its supernatural powers to tales of a devil who played the violin beneath it during the night. Once part of a larger forest, it was left isolated after the area was flooded during the construction of a dam., England’s finalist in the tree of the year vote was the Allerton Oak in Calderstones Park, Liverpool. It is thought to be about 1,000 years old, and has a girth of 5.5 metres, producing 100,000 acorns per year. In medieval times, court cases were held beneath its canopy and more recently, it is thought Paul McCartney and John Lennon would cycle past the tree on their way to college., This elm, nicknamed after the sentient trees in JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy, was crowned Scotland’s tree of the year. The Last Ent of Affric is a lonely specimen, but isolation protected it from Dutch elm disease – social distancing for trees, if you will. It grows near Glen Affric in the Highlands.

A third of healthcare facilities in developing countries also lack access to clean water on site., “It’s really obvious that in Africa and parts of Asia we should be very fearful of what is to come,” he said. “The coronavirus crisis highlights how vulnerable the world is.”, The UN World Water Development report, published on Sunday, pointed to the underfunding of water infrastructure around the world, despite its importance., Richard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report, told the Observer that water was often overlooked for spending and investment because the economic benefits of better water and sanitation were not emphasised. The coronavirus crisis sheds new light on those mistakes., “One of the reasons underlying the investment gap in water and sanitation is that these services are perceived mainly as a social - and in some cases environmental - issue, rather than an economic one, like energy,” he said. “Yet the economic costs of an outbreak such as Covid-19 are enormous, both in terms of national economies and stock markets, as well as in terms of household revenue - when people cannot work because of sickness or lockdowns. Realising the economic importance of water and sanitation should provide an additional catalyst for greater investment.”, Another reason for the neglect of water and sanitation is that people are generally willing to pay for the water coming into their homes, but not for transporting and treating afterwards. “Once it is flushed down the toilet, it disappears and becomes someone else’s problem,” said Connor. “Treating wastewater is several times more expensive than treating the source water in the first place. So without a willingness to pay on the part of users, it falls on governments to foot the bill, and since they do not recognise the economic value of wastewater treatment – which is perceived as more of an environmental issue - the political will behind such spending is low.”, Yet improving access to water and sanitation has clear benefits – in the coronavirus crisis, and beyond. Connor quotes evidence that suggests that the return on investment in water and sanitation can be high, with a global average benefit–cost ratio of 5.5 for improved sanitation and 2.0 for improved drinking water, when broader macroeconomic benefits are taken into account., Water use has increased sixfold in the past century and is rising by about 1% a year owing to rising populations and increasing demand, while climate breakdown means that more areas of the world will see stress on their water supplies, including regions where supplies were previously abundant, such as many parts of Europe, Asia and north America., One possible source for renewed investment in water is through a better understanding of the links between water issues and water infrastructure and the climate crisis, the UN report suggests., While trillions in investment have been poured into reducing greenhouse gas emissions around the world in the last decade, through clean energy and low-carbon technology, few resources have been devoted to the water supply. This year’s UN water report has found that opportunities are being missed to use water projects to cut greenhouse gas emissions while improving access to clean water., Sewage treatment is a clear example: wastewater gives rise to between 3% and 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions globally, more than flying. Processing sewage can turn wastewater from a source of carbon to a source of clean energy, if the methane is captured and used in place of natural gas. Currently, between 80% and 90% of wastewater around the world is discharged to the environment with no treatment., Farming methods can also be adapted to use water more efficiently and cut carbon at the same time, because when soils are better managed they hold more organic matter, more carbon and more water – rendering them more fertile as well as sequestering greenhouse gases., That makes investing in water a “win-win-win”, in terms of improving people’s lives, generating economic growth and helping to cut carbon, the report found., Yet of the hundreds of billions in climate finance devoted to developing countries in recent years, projects involving water made up less than 1% in 2016, the latest year for which full figures were available, according to the report., “Water does not need to be a problem – it can be part of the solution to the climate crisis,” said Audrey Azoulay, director-general of Unesco. “Water can support efforts to both reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change.”, Wainwright said the key ingredient for success in fixing the world’s water problems, alongside funding, was improving governance and how water supplies are managed., “Water needs good governance,” he said. “That is usually what is missing.

It ruled the upgrade would have needed to cut the plant’s emissions intensity – how much it emits per unit of electricity generated – below the grid average., A consultant working on behalf of Delta lobbied the government for the rules to be changed, arguing the guidelines for the fund said coal power could be eligible. Documents released last April suggest St Baker, the company’s part-owner, was denied an “urgent meeting” on the issue, but the then environment minister, Melissa Price, requested a review of how the policy could be used., A scheduled review by the independent emissions reduction assurance committee was already under way at the time. The resulting report, posted online earlier this month, backs the existing rules enforced by the regulator., The decision was welcomed by activists and analysts who argue coal plants, which emit substantial greenhouse gases, should not receive climate funding., But they noted Vales Point was still also in line to receive an $11m federal grant, according to a document released in February, before coronavirus delayed the government’s budget plans., Richie Merzian, from the Australia Institute, said the committee’s decision showed the value of “truly independent entities” that served the public on climate change., “Lobbying by coal executives has put much pressure on the government to allow greater access to climate funding for the coal industry,” Merzian said. “Fortunately, the independent review committee has made the right choice in maintaining the legal checks and balances that ensure the fund is not rorted.”, Suzanne Harter, a campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said it was unbelievable that an environment minister had asked officials to consider ways climate funding could be given to old coal plants. “Fortunately, common sense prevailed in this instance,” she said. “Public money should not be given to millionaires to prop up their ailing toxic investments.”, Delta Electricity’s chief executive, Greg Everett, declined to comment on Monday as the company was focused on its response to coronavirus., Freedom-of-information documents last year showed the company’s consultant, John Short, had suggested to the government it would consider appealing to the administrative appeals tribunal if the regulator’s decision was not overturned., Delta wanted to bid into the emissions reduction fund to help replace components on two units commissioned in 1978. It was estimated the upgrade would have cut emissions by 900,000 tonnes over a decade, about a 1.3% reduction below what Vales Point would otherwise expect to emit., The company bought the plant from the NSW government for just $1m in 2015. It was re-valued at $730m two years later. Documents submitted to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission show Sunset Power International’s shareholders received dividends of nearly $72m over the past two financial years., St Baker has flagged extending Vales Point’s operation beyond its expected closure date of 2029 to 2049. The company said a decision on prolonging the plant’s life was not contingent on public funding., The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction, rewarding landowners and businesses that make cheap, viable bids for taxpayers’ support to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The next auction is scheduled for this week., Asked for a response to the committee assessment, a spokesman for the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said: “The government’s objective is to bring forward large volumes of genuine, low cost abatement from across the economy.”push to get taxpayer funds for vales point coal plant upgrade rejected", "label": 0}, "train-549": {"text": "\nElectric cars produce less CO2 than petrol vehicles, study confirms\n, Finding will come as boost to governments seeking to move to net zero carbon emissions, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nMon 23 Mar 2020 12.08 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 14.05 EDT\n\n, Electric vehicles produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars across the vast majority of the globe – contrary to the claims of some detractors, who have alleged that the CO2 emitted in the production of electricity and their manufacture outweighs the benefits., The finding is a boost to governments, including the UK, seeking to move to net zero carbon emissions, which will require a massive expansion of the electric car fleet. A similar benefit was found for electric heat pumps., In the UK, transport is now the biggest contributor to the climate crisis and domestic heating has been stubbornly stuck on natural gas for much of the country., Across the world, passenger road vehicles and household heating generate about a quarter of all emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. That makes electric vehicles essential to reducing overall emissions, but how clean an electric vehicle is also depends on how the electricity is generated, the efficiency of the supply and the efficiency of the vehicle., That has made some individuals and governments question whether these technologies are worth expanding. The study, published on Monday in the journal Nature Sustainability, produced a decisive yes., Scientists from the universities of Exeter, Nijmegen and Cambridge conducted lifecycle assessments that showed that even where electricity generation still involves substantial amounts of fossil fuel, there was a CO2 saving over conventional cars and fossil fuel heating., They found that in 53 out of 59 regions, comprising 95% of the world, electric vehicles and domestic heat pumps generate less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered cars or boilers. The only exceptions are heavily coal-dependent countries such as Poland., In countries such as Sweden, which gets most of its electricity from renewable sources, and France, which is largely powered by nuclear, the CO2 savings from using electric cars reach as high as 70% over their conventional counterparts., In the UK, the savings are about 30%. However, that is likely to improve further as electric vehicles grow even more efficient and more CO2 is taken out of the electricity generating system., Heat pumps use electricity and heat exchange systems – similar in principle to those found in fridges – to take advantage of the difference in temperature underground and at the surface, in the case of ground source heat pumps, and between the outdoor air and indoors in the case of air source heat pumps. If they were widely used, the study found, they could reduce global carbon emissions by up to 0.8 gigatons a year by 2050, or the equivalent of Germany’s emissions today., “The idea that electric vehicles or heat pumps could increase emissions is essentially a myth,” said Florian Knobloch of Nijmegen University in the Netherlands, the lead author of the study. “We’ve seen a lot of disinformation going around. Here is a definitive study that can dispel those myths.”, Jean-Francois Mercure, of Exeter University, a co-author of the study, added: “The answer is clear: to reduce carbon emissions, we should choose electric cars and household heat pumps over fossil fuel alternatives.”, Among the detractors has been Bjørn Lomborg, the climate controversialist, who argued in a column published in newspapers around the world last week that electric cars were “simply expensive gadgets heavily subsidised for the wealthy to feel good while doing very little for the planet”., Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “Electric vehicles and heat pumps are absolutely critical for meeting climate goals so it’s good to see this favourable report. In the UK, both technologies will continue to make big carbon savings alongside our switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy to power the electricity grid.”, But he warned that insulating homes and improving public transport remained important goals, alongside electric vehicles and heat pumps, and called for much more government action to realise the benefits., “Where the UK is dragging its feet is supporting the necessary rapid rollout of electric cars and heat pumps as well as the infrastructure to support them,” he said.electric cars produce less co2 than petrol vehicles study confirms", "label": 0}, "train-550": {"text": "\nCattle gridlock: EU border delays add to coronavirus strain on meat trade\n, Possible slaughterhouse shutdowns and staffing issues put pressure on ‘vulnerable’ supply chains, as campaigners call for restriction of live exports, \nBibi van der Zee, \n\nMon 23 Mar 2020 12.01 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 23 Mar 2020 13.48 EDT\n\n, Campaigners have called for the suspension of all live animal shipments out of Europe, and a restriction to the shortest possible journeys within Europe, over welfare and animal diseases concerns – as meat supply chains face potentially debilitating strain. , Last week queues of up to 60km (37 miles) formed at the Polish/German border on Wednesday after Poland announced that it was shutting to foreigners. Although the closure was supposed to apply solely to people, cargo experienced a knock-on effect, with some trucks reportedly taking as long as 18 hours to get through border controls. More queues formed at the Bulgarian/Turkish border. Sabine Fisher of German animal welfare group Animal Angels said: “One driver told us that it had taken him three hours to travel 300 metres. There were trucks of sheep, bulls, cows. I’ve never seen a queue like it.”, Under EU regulations no animal should travel for more than eight hours without being rested. Campaigners have now sent a letter to the EU commission calling for the immediate suspension of live animal transport to non-EU countries, and of all journeys over eight hours within the EU, as such journeys also raise concerns over disease transmission., The letter, signed by a number of organisations including Compassion in World Farming, Eurogroup for Animals and Animals International, said: “The potential for long distance animal transport to spread diseases, some of them zoonotic, is deeply worrying. EFSA the European Food Safety Authority has said that the stresses associated with handling and transport may cause latent infections to proceed to clinical disease. EFSA states: ‘such animals are more likely to infect others during the journey or after arrival at their destination and in many cases (eg salmonellosis) this will also increase the risk to public health’.”, “Farm animals are either a source or messenger of zoonotic diseases,” said Gabriel Paun of Animals International “Suspending live export and trading meat instead will ensure both food security and public health. With the current border crisis, the EU commission breaks its own transport regulations by deliberately putting animals through planned and unnecessary suffering. On top of that they expose all the animal handlers, truck drivers and others to risk.”, The border crisis has added to growing anxiety about the meat supply chain. Any shutdown of slaughterhouses could lead to supply restrictions, price rises and problems for farmers, say experts., “The slaughterhouse system is extremely vulnerable because although there is an increasing amount of automation, they are still largely dependent on human labour,” said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst with IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence. “If someone is ill on the line, then does the whole line have to self-isolate and for how long? The plant will have to be shut down and deep cleaned. And then if there are not enough inspectors, or if staff just don’t come in, they will also have to shut down.”, If there are no vets or inspectors available, the plant cannot operate. And the stringent hygiene requirements mean that a shortage of gloves and other sanitation equipment of the type currently needed by medical staff could mean shutdown., Slaughterhouses are acknowledged to be the vulnerable point in the meat supply chain. A huge amount of consolidation in the last few decades means that both the US and EU have fewer, larger meat processing plants. In the US, according to the Animal Welfare Institute, the number of slaughterhouses fell from nearly 8,000 in 1970 to just under 3,000 in 2018. And in the UK, according to the Sustainable Food Trust, the number of red meat abattoirs has fallen from about 1,900 in 1971 to 249 in 2018., When a single US Tyson beef plant was shut down by a fire last summer, it caused a market shock that some called “historically significant”. The margins for beef carcasses doubled, while prices for live cattle fell. This is because shutdowns mean farmers may not be able to take their cattle to slaughter, and will then face unexpected costs in feed and care., On top of this the meat processing industry has long struggled to attract workers. “Finding workers for slaughterhouses has been a global problem,” said Rupert Claxton of international food consultancy Gira. “But we’ve got a particular problem now because if you are earning £13 an hour, are you going to be coming into work if you’re at risk? And these workers are not immediately replaceable; you need a week’s training, shadowing someone else on the line.”, There were reports early in the week that Danish Crown, one of Europe’s largest pork producers, had been concerned about the possible closure of one of its plants. However, a spokesperson explained that although many of the workers at the Danish plant commute regularly from Poland, they are confident production will continue at normal levels., Karsten Maier of the European Livestock and Meat Trades Union said that it was hard to have a complete overview of the situation at present, but that they were closely monitoring events., In the UK, David Lindars of the British Meat Processors Association told the Guardian: “We have been in regular contact with the Food Standards Authority, and have come up with a robust plan and very strong contingency plans for the UK.”, meat prices could rise as covid 19 adds pressure to vulnerable supply chain coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-551": {"text": "\nCoronavirus pandemic leading to huge drop in air pollution\n, ‘Largest scale experiment ever’ shows what is possible as satellite images reveal marked fall in global nitrogen dioxide levels, \nJonathan Watts and \nNiko Kommenda, \n\nMon 23 Mar 2020 08.01 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 31 Mar 2020 05.27 EDT\n\n, The coronavirus pandemic is shutting down industrial activity and temporarily slashing air pollution levels around the world, satellite imagery from the European Space Agency shows., One expert said the sudden shift represented the “largest scale experiment ever” in terms of the reduction of industrial emissions., Readings from ESA’s Sentinel-5P satellite show that over the past six weeks, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over cities and industrial clusters in Asia and Europe were markedly lower than in the same period last year., Nitrogen dioxide is produced from car engines, power plants and other industrial processes and is thought to exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma., While not a greenhouse gas itself, the pollutant originates from the same activities and industrial sectors that are responsible for a large share of the world’s carbon emissions and that drive global heating., Paul Monks, professor of air pollution at the University of Leicester, predicted there will be important lessons to learn. “We are now, inadvertently, conducting the largest-scale experiment ever seen,” he said. “Are we looking at what we might see in the future if we can move to a low-carbon economy? Not to denigrate the loss of life, but this might give us some hope from something terrible. To see what can be achieved.”, Monks, the former chair of the UK government’s science advisory committee on air quality, said that a reduction in air pollution could bring some health benefits, though they were unlikely to offset loss of life from the disease., “It seems entirely probable that a reduction in air pollution will be beneficial to people in susceptible categories, for example some asthma sufferers,” he said. “It could reduce the spread of disease. A high level of air pollution exacerbates viral uptake because it inflames and lowers immunity.” Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth, he added., The World Health Organization describes NO2 as “a toxic gas which causes significant inflammation of the airways” at concentrations above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. Pollution particles may also be a vector for pathogens, as well as exacerbating existing health problems. The WHO is now investigating whether airborne pollution particles may be a vector that spreads Covid-19 and makes it more virulent., One of the largest drops in pollution levels could be seen over the city of Wuhan, in central China, which was put under a strict lockdown in late January. The city of 11 million people serves as a major transportation hub and is home to hundreds of factories supplying car parts and other hardware to global supply chains. According to Nasa, nitrogen dioxide levels across eastern and central China have been 10-30% lower than normal., NO2 levels also dropped in South Korea, which has long struggled with high emissions from its large fleet of coal-fired power plants but also from nearby industrial facilities in China., The country has avoided putting entire regions under lockdown but is meticulously tracing and isolating suspected coronavirus cases., The changes over northern Italy are particularly striking because smoke from a dense cluster of factories tends to get trapped against the Alps at the end of the Po Valley, making this one of western Europe’s pollution hotspots., Since the country went into lockdown on 9 March, NO2 levels in Milan and other parts of northern Italy have fallen by about 40%. “It’s quite unprecedented,” said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Service. “In the past, we have seen big variations for a day or so because of weather. But no signal on emissions that has lasted so long.”, The source is not yet clear. One possibility is a slowdown of activity in Italy’s industrial heartland. Another factor is likely to be a reduction in road traffic, which accounts for the biggest share of nitrogen dioxide emissions in Europe., Peuch said satellites were now starting to pick up similar signals in other European cities that are entering into lockdowns, though the data needs to studied over over a longer period to confirm this is a pattern., Although the UK is more than a week behind Italy in terms of the spread of the disease and the government’s response, roadside monitors already show significantly reduced levels of pollution at hotspots such as Marylebone in London., Road traffic accounts for about 80% of nitrogen oxide emissions in the UK, according to Monk. For the average diesel car, each kilometre not driven avoids 52 milligrammes of the pollutant entering the air., “What I think will come out of this is a realisation - because we are forced to - that there is considerable potential to change working practices and lifestyles. This challenges us in the future to think, do we really need to drive our car there or burn fuel for that,” said Monk.coronavirus pandemic leading to huge drop in air pollution", "label": 0}, "train-552": {"text": "\n‘A manatee is worth more alive’: the mission to save Africa’s sea mammals\n, \n‘A manatee is worth more alive’: the mission to save Africa’s sea mammals\n, Once branded ‘rogue animals’, the elusive creatures were on the brink of extinction, but hope is rising for their survival, Annika Hammerschlag, \n\nMon 23 Mar 2020 06.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 21 Apr 2020 05.27 EDT\n\n, It is a blistering day in the Senegalese coastal town of Joal and a group of biologists are standing in a motorised dugout canoe, scanning the cyan waters for floating manatee dung., Suddenly, a bobbing brown mass appears in the distance., “Look! Over there! Poo!” cries Lucy Keith-Diagne, the lead researcher. But her excitement is quickly stifled when it turns out to be a piece of wood., For the past 14 years Keith-Diagne has been on a mission to protect the African manatee. There are an estimated 10,000 left, spread across 21 African countries, from the coast of Senegal down to Angola and inland to Chad. The DNA extracted from faecal samples allows Keith-Diagne to isolate individual populations and determine which groups are most endangered., African manatees are classified as a vulnerable species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. They face many threats, including entanglement in fishing nets and entrapment in dams. In some countries they are heavily poached., The animals are so elusive that many locals know them only from myths. In countries such as Senegal, where the animals are revered as auspicious water spirits, poaching is rare. But dams still pose a major threat: the cumbersome mammals can get trapped in narrow passageways and drown., Keith-Diagne said local dam authorities have been receptive to her proposed modifications of the structures. Politicians have also come on board. In 2014, her husband, Tomas Diagne, also a biologist, successfully petitioned the government to set aside 275 hectares (679 acres) for an aquatic reserve. The area is now home to an estimated 100 manatees as well as hundreds of Adanson’s mud turtles – a species unique to the local lake. The couple are also helping the surrounding communities to develop an ecotourism industry., Keith-Diagne’s conservation work has extended into other parts of Africa. With the help of a Pew Marine fellowship, she formed a network of nine biologists in Senegal, Gambia, Nigeria, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo to document every manatee captured or killed over three years. The project has already identified one clear trend: Nigeria is a leader in manatee mortality., Hunters can make up to $2,000 (£1,626) from a single catch in the country, where manatee meat is said to be beneficial for diabetics and their oil is thought to be cholesterol-free. In addition, their penises are believed to cure impotence, their ear bones to ward off bullets, and eyes believed to possess magical powers. The faeces left over in manatee intestines are dried and used to mend broken bones., According to Nigerian myth, upon encountering a human, a manatee will tickle them until they laugh so hard they drown., Rumours of manatees breaking fishing nets and capsizing canoes led to their classification as a “rogue animal” in the 1970s – an official classification for animals that threaten human livelihoods, such as crocodiles and hippopotami., The classification was intended as a way for government officials to meet revenue targets, says Edem Eniang, a professor of wildlife resource management at the University of Uyo in Nigeria., Nigeria began issuing manatee hunting permits but stopped in the early 1990s when hunters began returning empty-handed, demanding refunds. The animals had been driven to the brink of extinction. Now Nigeria has conservation laws that protect manatees and other endangered wildlife, but critics say they are rarely enforced., If we don’t do something now, we’ll end up eating the last manatee, “Poachers trade them openly on the street, and nobody does anything,” says Eniang. Last month, Nigeria’s environment ministry announced it was launching an investigation after a video emerged of a manatee being dragged along a road by a group of young men., The manatee market in Nigeria is so profitable that poachers traffic the animals from neighbouring countries. A growing demand for live manatees in Asia has made matters worse, Eniang adds., “I’m sitting out here like a lone wolf, crying into the wilderness,” he says. “If we don’t do something now, we’ll end up eating the last manatee.”, In addition to poaching, manatees in Nigeria are suffering from habitat loss. During the dry season farmers graze their cattle on the nutritious wetlands where manatees feed – the climate crisis has left the herders little alternative. As the cattle graze, the farmers set what’s left on fire, hoping it will spur growth., Oil spills, sand dredging and urban development have also contributed to the destruction of Nigeria’s manatee habitat., Eniang and his team often go undercover, posing as buyers to keep tabs on poachers and document manatee killings. They visit schools to teach the importance of conservation and they run TV and radio information campaigns. Such campaigns can and have made a difference. In Cameroon, education and awareness initiatives have pushed manatee hunting to its lowest level., Aristide Takoukam, the director of the African Marine Mammal Conservation Organisation in Cameroon, gives frequent presentations at schools and organises field trips to Lake Ossa, a wildlife reserve created in 1948., I want to show children that in animals, they can also find beauty, “I want to teach them to see nature in a different way than their parents,” he says. “I want to show them that in animals, they can also find beauty.”, He also trains fishermen in how to make a living from bee farming and soap making instead of manatee hunting and with the help of an American ecotourism expert, is developing an industry around manatee sightseeing, complete with lakeside bungalows, kayaking and bird watching., “I want to show them that a manatee is worth more alive than dead,” he says., Though Takoukam has effectively shifted local attitudes toward manatees, another threat has emerged in the waters of Lake Ossa., Since 2017, the lake has seen a proliferation of salvinia molesta, an invasive plant that kills the antelope grass manatees feed on. The animals have begun migrating into unprotected waters in search of food., Takoukam suspects that a reservoir dam erected on the Sanaga River in 2016 is to blame. The structure flooded vast areas of land, causing plants to decompose and release high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. When the gates lift, those nutrients are released downstream, ultimately accumulating in the stagnant waters of Lake Ossa. The concentration of phosphorus in the lake has doubled over the past three years., Takoukam contacted a number of experts asking for help and Louisiana State University answered. They sent him 350 salvinia-eating insects called salvinia weevils, which are currently being reared in a facility near Lake Ossa. As soon as the tick-sized bugs have multiplied they’ll be released onto the lake., “My manatees were at risk so I needed to find a solution,” Takoukam says., It is this kind of attitude that inspired Keith-Diagne to organise the first-ever African manatee symposium. The event, planned for April in Senegal, will bring together more than 50 manatee conservationists from at least nine African countries, as well as experts from Florida, Malaysia and Brazil., It will be the first time activists such as Takoukam and Eniang have a platform to present their work., “People think nothing is being done to help the African manatee, but actually there’s been a lot of progress,” Keith-Diagne says. “It’s an opportunity to inspire others.”, • This article was corrected on 31 March 2020 to remove a reference to a dam built on Senegal River.

The migratory butterfly flew in from Africa via continental Europe in greater numbers than in any summer apart from 2009 and 1996., Prof Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation said the encouraging results “provide evidence that the overall rate of decline of butterflies is slowing and for some species being reversed”., He said conservation through agri-environment schemes, increased woodland cover, climate warming and “increases in grazing levels by wild animals and a slowing in the rate of agricultural intensification” had all played their part., Dr Marc Botham of the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology said two warm summers in succession, which allowed population numbers to build up over a longer period, had also contributed to the boom year., “In addition to record numbers of spring species such as orange-tip and brimstone, it was also encouraging to see annual increases in garden favourites such as peacock and small tortoiseshell, both of which have had some poor years recently,” he said., Some species, however, are struggling to adapt to rapid climatic changes. The rare heath fritillary saw its annual abundance drop by 34%. Its numbers have fallen by 91% over the long term as a result of climate change and a loss of traditional coppicing in woodlands and grazing on moorland., The figures show that targeted conservation work is helping many rarer species, including the chequered skipper, up by 175% on 2018, and the Duke of Burgundy, which a decade ago was threatened with extinction but recorded its eighth best year since 1976. Other species benefiting from habitat management include the marsh fritillary, silver-studded blue and silver-spotted skipper, none of which are now in long-term population decline., “We’re really heartened to see a shift in the fortunes of many of our most loved species,” Brereton said. “The long-term situation for butterflies in general does remain a cause of concern though, with more species declining than increasing since the 1970s.”warm summer of 2019 gives flight to butterfly numbers", "label": 0}, "train-554": {"text": "\nCountry diary 1970: the tough, wild setting of Exmoor's East Lyn river\n, 26 March 1970 What seems like a hundred thousand writhing branches of oak overarch the paths and rides, Brian Chugg, \n\nMon 23 Mar 2020 02.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 26 Mar 2020 10.19 EDT\n\n, EXMOOR: Paths constructed beside the East Lyn a century and a half ago when Lynmouth first attracted visitors after the Napoleonic wars are the only man-made feature in a tough, wild setting.

After days of rain, the field drains jetted water from the steep, saturated fields above, giving the overgrown brook an unusual urgency as it tumbled towards the water-rounded cobbles of the shoreline., Storm surf driven by recent gale-force winds had stirred up sediment and detritus from the floor of the shallow bay, leaving the seawater discoloured and turbid.

The stonechats that often sing here were absent, perhaps deterred by the strong wind, but on the hilltop pastures lambs raced in groups around the stolid ewes.

Between the two, the sand-banked and marsh-fringed estuary of the Afon Dyfi reached inland towards Machynlleth., This spot, Craig yr Wylfa, is well named – translating roughly as the lookout rock. On a good day, you can see the whole breadth of Cardigan Bay from here – a horizon 50 miles across. This was not one of those days, but the strategic advantage gained by anyone who held the cliff in historic times was still evident., Dropping out of the wind, the grassy slope towards Borth gave me time to look across the expanse of Cors Fochno, the great peat wetland beyond the Afon Leri. Beneath towering clouds, the patches of open water within the mosaic of mottled vegetation looked almost black in the afternoon sun, but the light suddenly softened.

Europeans also use their ink as a colouring agent in food, ink and paint., Owing to over-exploitation, cuttlefish have just been declared an endangered species along the south coast. Next month they will be coming into shallow water to breed and lay their rubbery black eggs, known as sea grapes, on seaweed and sea grass., They are remarkable partly because they can change colour at will to match their background but also use this talent in dazzling courtship displays. More recently, scientists have discovered that they are both intelligent and have good memories., While cuttlefish eat lots of things, including crabs, their favourite food is shrimps. In a series of experiments using captive specimens, scientists discovered that they could remember routines and be patient.

The fact that Covid-19 is fatal for some humans leads experts to fear it could potentially prove devastating to great apes., No great apes have yet been reported to have contracted Covid-19, so the true impact is unknown. But many great apes are already at risk of extinction due to forest destruction and poaching, so the researchers say closing national parks, reserves and zoos must be seriously considered., National parks in Congo and Rwanda have already shut to tourists and researchers, but the decision is not an easy one. Without a human presence, the risk of poaching rises., “The Covid-19 pandemic is a critical situation for humans, our health and our economies,” said Thomas Gillespie, at Emory University, US, and a lead author of a letter from 25 experts published in the journal Nature. “It’s also a potentially dire situation for great apes. There is a lot at stake for those in danger of extinction.”, “People who are younger, who may be less at risk for severe illness from Covid-19, are the ones who are more likely to be hiking into the national parks of Africa and Asia to see great apes in the wild,” Gillespie said. “It would be extremely difficult to monitor whether they were infected with Covid-19 since they may not have obvious symptoms.”, Research in 2008 revealed the first direct evidence of virus transmission from humans to wild apes. Since then common human respiratory viruses have caused lethal outbreaks in wild great apes that have become used to people. In 2016 scientists reported the transmission of a human coronavirus to wild chimpanzees in the Taï National Park in Ivory Coast., In 2017, Gillespie co-authored a report showing that 60% of the more than 500 primate species worldwide are threatened with extinction, while 75% have declining populations., The number of surviving mountain gorillas has been rising, with about 1,000 now living in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, and the species was moved from critically endangered to endangered. It is the only great ape believed to be increasing in number., “But the recent gains could rapidly reverse if disease is introduced, so protection is key at this critical time,” said Cath Lawson, Africa conservation manager at WWF UK., Action is also being taken to protect some orangutans, with the Sepilok Rehabilitation Centre closing in Malaysian Borneo. “This disease could be fatal for the already critically endangered orangutan: it is a risk that we cannot to afford take,” said Susan Sheward of Orangutan Appeal UK., The latest guidance from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature says the distance normally kept between people and great apes should increase from 7m to 10m. It also says no one who is ill, or who has been in contact with anybody ill in the preceding 14 days, should be allowed to visit great apes., The authors of the Nature article conclude: “We hope for the best but should prepare for the worst and critically consider the impact of our activities on these endangered species.”coronavirus poses lethal threat to great apes experts warn", "label": 0}, "train-558": {"text": "\nGreta Thunberg says it's 'extremely likely' she has had coronavirus\n, Activist says she self isolated and warns young people to take the outbreak seriously, \nMatthew Taylor, \n\nTue 24 Mar 2020 13.29 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 24 Mar 2020 17.49 EDT\n\n, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired the global school climate strikes, says it is “extremely likely” she has had the Covid-19 virus., The teenager, whose solo protest outside the Swedish parliament kickstarted the global youth campaign, said in a post on Instagram that she had self isolated after she and her father returned from a trip around central Europe about two weeks ago., A few days later she said they both began to feel ill, and she complained of feeling tired with “shivers, sore throat and cough”., Thunberg said she had not been tested for the virus, in line with the policy in Sweden, and was now “basically recovered”., But she issued an urgent warning to other young people to take the virus seriously – even if they themselves were often only facing mild symptoms., “We who do not belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others.”, The school strike movement has propelled millions of young people on to the streets in countries on every continent to demand urgent action to avoid widespread breakdown.

It could be that the device has stopped working or that, sadly, Sally is no more., Phil Sheldrake, species recovery officer with the RSPB, said: “It’s great that we have an egg – and quite a bit earlier than last year.”, The female on the nest does not have an identity ring, meaning that it is not known if she is the same one that produced four eggs last year, but Sheldrake said it was highly likely that it was the same bird., “Peregrines do not like to be overlooked,” he said. “Salisbury Cathedral sticks out like a sore thumb above the rolling countryside. It’s like a five-star hotel for them.”, There are generally three or four eggs in a clutch and incubation doesn’t start until the last egg is laid. Once that has happened, the female – and male - will sit on the nest at intervals to keep eggs warm. Incubation lasts 29-32 days, so if all goes well, chicks should appear in early May., Meanwhile, the tracker attached to Sally, who became a television star after featuring on BBC’s Springwatch in 2017, last pinpointed her on 3 November 2019 above the village of Coombe Bissett, three miles from Salisbury – but no signal has been picked up since., Sheldrake said: “We don’t know if she’s alive or whether the tracker has simply stopped working. We haven’t seen her on the cameras at the cathedral and it’s quite possible the tracking device has just stopped working after nearly three years., “She is possibly 10 now, and whilst the oldest peregrine known was at least 24, the average lifespan is around 10.” The tracker works on solar power, so if Sally has died it would probably not receive enough light to carry on working., Salisbury Cathedral has a historic bond with peregrines, which was broken in the 20th century because of persecution and pesticides. The first pair to breed in modern times arrived in 2014. The birds have done well there since then, apart from in 2018 when no eggs were laid following an unholy scrap between Sally and an unringed female.peregrine falcon drama at salisbury cathedral with a new egg and a lost bird", "label": 0}, "train-561": {"text": "\nCovid-19 economic rescue plans must be green, say environmentalists\n, Campaigners urge governments to tie any bailouts to aviation and cruise industries to requirements for climate action, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nTue 24 Mar 2020 06.06 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 24 Mar 2020 06.08 EDT\n\n, The economic rescue packages to deal with the impact of the coronavirus must also be green, a growing chorus of environmental campaigners have urged, concerned that hasty measures will lock the world into a high-carbon future., “Governments need to put huge amounts of money into trying to sustain jobs and livelihoods,” said Mary Robinson, a former Irish president and UN high commissioner for human rights, who served twice as UN climate envoy. “But they must do it with a very strong green emphasis. The threat from climate change is as real as the threat from Covid-19, though it seems far away.”, “Money has poured into the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015,” she said. “That can’t continue.”, But she said the changes wrought in societies around the world by dealing with Covid-19 would also demonstrate to people that the changes needed to achieve a low-carbon future were much less drastic and far more palatable. As far as the climate was concerned, “we must not go back to bad habits afterwards”, she said. “It will be easier to persuade people, as we have had to change so dramatically because of this threat.”, Economic plans worth trillions of dollars in public money are being rolled out to stave off the immediate collapse of some badly hit businesses, such as airlines and tourism – and to protect the incomes of workers in danger of redundancy as normal life becomes impossible across Europe and large parts of the US, as it already has in many parts of east Asia., But while people’s health and the immediate welfare of workers caught up in the crisis are paramount, campaigners and experts fear that if the longer-term packages are not carefully designed they will only entrench fossil fuel dependence across the global economy., “Governments are drawing up stimulus plans to counter the economic damage from coronavirus,” said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. “These stimulus packages offer an excellent opportunity to ensure that the essential task of building a secure and sustainable energy future doesn’t get lost amid the flurry of immediate priorities.”, Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic., According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment., About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19., In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:, As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system., Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities., In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home., The Bank of England is resuming its quantitative easing programme of buying up assets to create liquidity in the financial system, as it did after the 2008 crash, but there are concerns that the programme has previously been used to buy bonds from fossil fuel companies including Shell, BP and Total., There have been calls in some areas, such as eastern Europe and in Asia, to ignore climate concerns and pour stimulus money into existing high-carbon businesses and fossil fuels, rather than seeking a balance with a longer-term view that includes the need to curb emissions., John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said governments must act urgently to protect people’s livelihoods, which could be done without directing the money to prop up ailing sectors whose long-term future was already threatened by the climate crisis., “Decisions are being made now about whether to spend billions rescuing airlines, cruise ships, the oil and gas industry, among many others,” he said. “Bailing out the shareholders of dirty industries to continue businessasusual rather than protecting workers and their families means we would have learnt nothing from the bank bailout during the financial crisis.”, Green campaigners have long talked about a “just transition” that would enable workers to move away from fossil fuel-dependent jobs and into skilled jobs with long-term low-carbon prospects. They argue this is compatible with tackling the coronavirus, too – but only if governments resist calls to downgrade environmental aims in light of the new crisis., “Diluting or doing away with environmental regulations to get a quick economic hit, as China and Poland are suggesting, would be misplaced – out of the frying pan, into the fire, even if the fire seems a few years away,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. “It is striking that the ruling party in South Korea has not let coronavirus deter it from proposing a green new deal election manifesto. But I would expect the UK to prioritise the immediate economic impact while also applying a climate lens and thinking about the longer term.”, In the US, campaigners are concerned that Donald Trump’s hostility to climate science and wooing of fossil fuel industries will skew the economic rescue packages in harmful ways. The planned bailout for airlines and the cruise industry’s request for cash are an immediate worry., “Given that airlines produce a very large and growing amount of climate pollution, any financial assistance should include requirements that these companies take action to reduce their emissions,” said Annie Petsonk of the US-based Environmental Defense Fund. “The cruise industry, which has also requested billions in aid, has serious environmental impacts as well, and should meet new standards in exchange for government funding.”, She said that in return for public money, companies should give firm commitments on carbon. “That would be a major step in the fight against climate change. Taxpayers, many of whom are now struggling financially, have the right to expect responsible behaviour in exchange for bailouts. They should not be funding private businesses only to see them create more costs for the public – in the form of climate impacts – in the future.”, For many experts, the vital point is that the lessons from the stimulus following the financial crisis more than a decade ago are learned. Then, as now, global greenhouse gas emissions paused as the crisis hit. But after the immediate impact, emissions began their steady rise again and have continued to do so since, partly because the chance was missed to use the vast amounts of public money to set the world on a green path., “Given the state will never again play such a powerful role in our economy, and more broadly the global economy, if there was ever a time to join the dots between responding to the health emergency and the climate and nature emergency then this is it,” said Sauven. “The worst case would be that you haven’t used this awful crisis to reorientate the economy to achieve a much better outcome for people and the environment globally.”covid 19 economic rescue plans must be green say environmentalists", "label": 0}, "train-562": {"text": "\nPablo Escobar's 'cocaine hippos' show how invasive species can restore a lost world\n, Descendants of the drug lord’s pets bear similarities to extinct megafauna, \nPatrick Greenfield, \n\nTue 24 Mar 2020 05.12 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 24 Mar 2020 12.40 EDT\n\n, ﻿When the drug lord Pablo Escobar was shot dead in 1993, he left behind a zoo stocked with wild animals alongside his multibillion dollar cocaine empire. The lions, giraffes and other exotic species were moved from the luxurious Hacienda Nápoles estate east of Medellín to new homes, but nearly three decades later, dozens of hippos, descendants of animals left behind, are thriving in small lakes in northern Colombia, making them the world’s largest invasive animal., Now scientists say that contrary to the conventional wisdom that large invasive herbivore mammals have strictly negative effects on their new environments, Escobar’s “cocaine” hippos show how introduced species can restore a lost world., A team of conservation biologists has compared the traits and impacts on the ecosystems from large invasive herbivore species like the Colombian hippo with their extinct counterparts from the Late Pleistocene (around 116,000-12,000 years ago) period like mammoths, giants sloths and giant wombats. They found some modern day invasive species restore parts of ecosystems not seen since before humans began driving the widespread extinctions of megafauna., Their new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that some introduced herbivore species are an almost perfect ecological match for extinct species from the Late Pleistocene, such as modern day wild horses known as mustangs and the extinct pre-domestic horses in North America, while others bring back a mixture of traits., “The feral hippos in South America are similar in diet and body size to extinct giant llamas, while a bizarre type of extinct mammal – a notoungulata – shares with hippos large size and semiaquatic habitats,” explained study co-author John Rowan, Darwin fellow in organismic and evolutionary biology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst., “So, while hippos don’t perfectly replace any one extinct species, they restore parts of important ecologies across several species.”, By comparing ecological traits of herbivore species from before the Late Pleistocene extinctions to the present day, such as body size, diet and habitat, researchers were able to quantify the extent to which introduced species were more or less similar to extinct predecessors., The analysis found that by introducing large herbivore species across the world, humans had restored lost ecological traits to many ecosystems, thereby counteracting a legacy of extinctions and making the world more like the pre-extinction late Pleistocene., Erick Lundgren, lead author and PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney, told the Guardian: “The word ‘invasive’ doesn’t really leave any room for organisms that do something that’s beneficial for another species. ‘Invaders’ don’t really help anything. And with that kind of anthropomorphic branding, you end up with a very limited range of research questions that are usually asked.”, The researchers give the example of wild pigs, which are widely disliked by farmers across the southern United States for destroying crops when large groups are “rooting” for food. But Lundgren said the behaviour is an ecosystem service that had been performed by other large herbivores that have since become extinct., “There are many species that did what pigs do: just turning over soil. In North America, there were these giant peccaries. There were all these species that did the same thing in the late Pleistocene. For millions of years, everything evolved with this kind of rooting behaviour,” he explained., “If you actually look at what that rooting behaviour does, it is of course density dependent. So if you have 10bn pigs rooting over every inch of soil, there are species that are going to lose their preferred habitats, 100%. But rooting actually does some interesting things. In Tennessee, they’ve found that trees actually grow faster because of the rooting of wild boar because they’re incorporating leaf litter in the soil, increasing decomposition rates and more nutrients become available quicker for trees.”, The study authors came from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in Australia, the University of Kansas, the University of California Davis and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in the US., Sussex University in the UK, the Universidad de Alcalá in Spain and Aarhus University in Denmark.pablo escobars cocaine hippos show how invasive species can restore a lost world aoe", "label": 0}, "train-563": {"text": "Parliament pension fund cuts fossil fuel investments, Pot worth £700m raises holdings in renewable energy after cross-party campaign , Parliament’s pension fund has made record investments in renewable energy and cut its exposure to fossil fuel companies to bring MPs’ pensions in line with the government’s climate action targets., A report from the £700m pension fund showed that almost a third is now being invested in low carbon and environmentally sustainable funds following calls from hundreds of MPs to align the fund with the government’s legally binding climate commitments., The decision by the pension fund’s trustees to back a push for greener investment, first revealed by the Guardian last year, has resulted in renewable energy infrastructure investments making up 5% of the fund for the first time., The move is a victory for the 360 serving and former MPs who have been pushing for the pension fund’s investments to fall in line with the government’s climate agenda., The campaign was supported by all of the Labour party’s leadership candidates, the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, and senior Conservatives including Guy Opperman, the minister for pensions and financial inclusion., However, the pension’s trustees have stopped short of divesting entirely from fossil fuel companies and retain multimillion-pound investments in the oil companies Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The annual report showed that the fund has decreased its investment in BP by almost two-thirds in the past year, to £4.4m, and cut its holdings in Shell by a quarter, to £8m., Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP behind the campaign, said the fund needs to fall in line with parliament’s decision last year to declare a climate emergency by divesting from all fossil fuels., “Investing in clean energy is clearly the right thing to do, financially and for the future of our planet, so I’m glad the Parliamentary Pension Fund is doing this.

If this is so, then we have had an exceptionally warm and wet season. Perhaps counter-intuitively, such weather can spell disaster for many insects; adapted as they are to sitting out a season, their biggest enemies become mould and bacteria that may proliferate in their dormant tissues. Concern turns to the potential impact on already struggling populations of insects that have faced so many challenges in recent times, most blatantly the fragmentation and pollution of their habitats. We must firmly add climate change to this list, the most recent evidence coming from a long-term study of glow-worm populations in Essex that found an overall fall of 75% in their numbers on 19 sites., Glow-worms are enigmatic and intriguing animals at every level. I can recall camping near Hastings as a child and seeing one glowing in the vegetation, but on investigating the mysterious light blinked out and the source could not be discovered. The larvae and the wingless female, Lampyris noctiluca, are brown segmented animals, not as instantly recognisable as beetles; they feast on snails and possess a white spongy appendage that extrudes from their rear-end and wipes snail slime from their body. The eyes of the adult male beetle are also fantastic: two great hooded orbs, aerial searchers for the cool, green lights of the females., “Bright scatter’d, twinkling star of spangled earth,” the Northamptonshire poet John Clare wrote of them in 1820, “Thy pale-fac’d glimmering light I love to see.” But everyone who is anyone has written about glow-worms; they are in A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Blake’s A Dream, as well as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Pliny, Dr Johnson and William Cowper. “We are all worms,” Churchill stated, “but I do believe that I am a glow-worm.”, Like coral reefs, glow-worms must now go on to the “last chance to see” list.

But for the first time on Monday, the caller wasn’t exaggerating., “This was the largest snake I have come across in 27 years,” Harrison said. “The poor old lady who opened the front door to see it there got the fright of her life”, The giant albino Burmese python was found in the Gold Coast suburb of Oxenford., With the snake weighing more than 80kg, Harrison said it was lucky for him the reptile was good-tempered., “Burmese pythons are from overseas, so he is obviously someone’s illegal pet … he had been in captivity his entire life, he is used to being held.”, But a missing tail and scars across its body suggested the snake had lived a rough life., Burmese pythons are an illegal species in Australia.

Last September, satellite images revealed the ozone hole annual peak had shrunk to 16.4m sq km, the smallest extent since 1982., “It’s a success story. This is more evidence that the Montreal protocol has led to the recovery of the ozone layer,” said the study’s lead author, Antara Banerjee, who works in the chemical sciences division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and is a visiting fellow at the University of Boulder, Colorado., The expected effect on people will vary from region to region. In Patagonia (southern Chile and Argentina), there should be more rain and less carcinogenic ultra-violet light. The findings will be of more concern for central South America (Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Brazil and northern Argentina), where ozone depletion was previously found to bring more rainfall and wider bands of agricultural production. The same may also be true of east Africa and other desert areas in the mid-latitudes., Previous studies suggest the reversal may also be good news for Australia, which has suffered more drought because the movement of the jet stream pushed rain-bearing storms away from its coast during winter. Whether this is enough to offset the rise in carbon emissions is another matter., The restoration of ozone is not enough to push southern hemisphere weather patterns back on to a normal track because other industrial emissions – such as carbon dioxide and methane – continue to exert a disruptive force in the opposite direction., “There is a tug of war between ozone recovery and increasing CO2. That’s why we are seeing a pause. In the near future, the ozone factor could dominate and the jet stream will move back towards equator. But once the recovery is complete, CO2 could push it southwards again,” Banerjee said., Alexey Karpechko, a reviewer of the paper who works for the Finnish Meteorological Institute, said the paper illustrated how ozone depletion had been the main driver in atmospheric circulation., “This is good news, definitely. It shows our actions can stop climate change,” he said. “We can see coordinated action works. It is a strong message to us as emitters of greenhouse gases.

Previous studies suggested the ozone hole had a chimney-like effect that sucked some of the heat out of the atmosphere, which meant the south pole warmed more slowly than the north.

Together the two countries make up almost two-thirds of global growth in wind power., GWEC had expected 2020 to emerge as a record year for the rollout of wind energy projects, and forecast growth of 20% in the year ahead, but it said the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic was as yet unknown., Most of the energy the US uses comes from oil made into gasoline for vehicles. For electricity production, 35% is from natural gas, 27% is from coal, 19% is from nuclear and 17% is from renewable energy (hydropower, wind, biomass and solar), according to the Energy Information Administration. , The virus outbreak could slow construction of energy projects in line with an economy-wide slowdown in manufacturing and infrastructure development, but the council believes Covid-19 could still present an opportunity for the wind industry., The council said the outbreak could prove to be an economic watershed, and it urged governments to use the growing industry to help galvanise economic recovery., The call echoes a warning from the boss of the International Energy Agency, Dr Fatih Birol, that the virus could undermine progress in clean energy development unless governments use green investments to help support economic growth., “We have an important window of opportunity,” Birol said. “Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well-designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.”, Ben Backwell, the chief executive of GWEC, said global clean energy growth is not where it needs to be to help keep global temperatures in check as part of the Paris climate accord., “If we are to have any chance at reaching our Paris agreement objectives and remaining on a 1.5C pathway, we need to be installing at least 100GW of wind energy per year, and this needs to rise to 200GW per year and beyond,” he said., The council had expected that global wind power installations would rise by 76GW this year but will offer a new forecast in the second quarter of the year that takes into account the impact of the coronavirus.worlds wind power capacity up by fifth after record year", "label": 0}, "train-568": {"text": "\nEngland could face droughts in 20 years due to climate breakdown - report\n, Auditor general predicts drought in 20 years as demand rises and climate crisis reduces supply , PA Media, \n\nWed 25 Mar 2020 03.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 26 Mar 2020 08.21 EDT\n\n, England is in danger of experiencing droughts within 20 years unless action is taken to combat the impact of the climate crisis on water availability, the public spending watchdog says., The National Audit Office (NAO), in a report published on Wednesday, says some parts of England, especially the south-east, are at risk of running out of water owing to decreased rainfall and a need to cut the amount taken from natural waterways., Water companies will have to reduce the quantity of water they take out of rivers, lakes and the ground by more than 1bn litres a day, creating huge shortfalls in the coming decades, the NAO warned., Parliament’s auditor predicted that 4bn litres of additional water supply would be needed each day by 2050 to counter the growing risk of drought from the climate emergency., The total supply is forecast to drop by 7% by 2045 because of the climate crisis and the need to scale back the amount of water taken out of England’s waterways and soils., The amount removed will need to be slashed by almost 500m litres a day to ensure sustainable biodiversity can continue, while drier weather is expected to see a 600m litre daily reduction in rainfall., According to NAO figures, the daily demand for water in England and Wales is 14bn litres, with the equivalent of 3bn litres of that lost through leakage. People on average use 143 litres of water every 24 hours., Gareth Davies, comptroller and auditor general of the NAO, criticised ministers in his report for failing to lead on the issue of water sustainability. He said personal water consumption had risen every year for the past five years.,  He called on the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) to co-ordinate a national approach to encouraging consumers and public bodies to reduce their water usage in an attempt to avoid water shortages in the coming decades., He said: “The government has made limited progress on reducing water consumption, tackling leakage and sharing water resources between regions in the last five years, but rapid progress is now vital for the government to deliver its objective of a resilient water supply., “Defra needs to provide stronger leadership to water companies, regulators and consumers.”, The report said during the past five years water companies had made little or no progress in reducing water consumption and cutting leakage., The NAO urged the government to monitor progress on the water suppliers’ pledge to reduce leaks by at least 15% by 2025., The report said ministers in 2018 committed to announcing a personal water consumption target but had yet to follow through on the promise., The NAO said it wanted Defra to promote a “more coherent and credible message” about water efficiency and develop a plan to evaluate its impact, with Whitehall leading on getting the message to consumers that they needed to save water., Defra should work with other government departments to reduce water consumption by large public sector users, such as hospitals and schools. The NAO said Defra should also better understand how willing the public were to pay higher water bills in order to improve water infrastructure., The regulator Ofwat and the Environment Agency should also have a role to play in regularly reviewing water companies’ progress on reducing consumption and leakage, the report recommended., A Defra spokesperson said: “We thank the NAO for this report as an important contribution to our work to meet our future water needs. We recognise that we need to work harder than ever to ensure that we all have enough water in the future and that is why we are already working towards many the report’s recommendations., “The recently published National Framework for Water Resources sets out a bold vision for bringing together consumers, businesses and industry to safeguard the future of our water resources while ensuring that our natural environment is protected for future generations.”parts of england could run out of water unless urgent action taken report", "label": 0}, "train-569": {"text": "\nCountry diary: old maps reveal folds in time\n, Stamford, Lincolnshire: You can time travel through maps, go back and back, and civilisation falls off the sheets like loosened scales, \nSimon Ingram, \n\nWed 25 Mar 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 25 Mar 2020 15.25 EDT\n\n, Looking at a map is travelling of a strange sort. A way of getting outside, without going outside. Of exploring while still. Where you can visualise the roll and tumble of land, and its vertical space, on something entirely flat. Where the tiniest twitch of gaze can leap miles. And decades., On the National Library of Scotland’s website you can time travel through maps. Go back, and back, and civilisation falls off these sheets like loosened scales. From a screen of pixels, shades of paper and shifts in typeface immediately evoke the smell and scratch of a mapmaker’s tools, separated from you by nothing but a dozen decades or so., I wanted to see how long a wood outside my town, one I’d always thought striking, has been there.

And the things not on any map: traffic noise, the glow of a petrol station sign. And birds. The wood is saturated with bird sound, and the thickety noise of unseen life. I see little of it: crows, like apostrophes in the canopy; a young rabbit fleeing through sharp undergrowth., Inside, it is dense and close, resplendent with growth unchecked. Purple buds stud the ground with colour. It’s hilly, steeply so: dug out, and reclaimed. Pathways through it suggest humans – trees bent into arches, firepits, one odd little hovel. Someone’s home? The hard lines of a phone mast mingle with the branch-scrabble above. A landscape shaped by people, left to nature, but still peopled. I stand still, and close my eyes. Time is gone, and all I hear is the birds., Home, but first a detour through a residential close, to see the site of something on the old map: a hospital for infectious diseases, complete with the oddly specific “smallpox huts”.

How it sits with 2016 and 2017 we are not sure yet.”, He said a fuller picture would be possible after the final three days of surveying. “They are crucial,” he said., Working with a staff member from government agency the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), Hughes has assessed bleaching levels on 682 reefs from a spotter plane flying at about 500 feet. , Global heating caused by escalating atmospheric greenhouse gases is a major threat to the world’s coral reef ecosystems. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the published evidence suggested a majority of tropical coral reefs would disappear even if heating was limited to 1.5C and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. The globe has warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution., Not all bleached corals die. Corals bleach when they sit in waters that are unusually hot for too long. They can recover if temperatures fall, but are often killed when high temperatures are sustained., Hughes said the first four days of aerial surveys last week covered almost 500 reefs from the Torres Strait to Cairns. They revealed a mixed picture, with some severe bleaching on reefs closer to shore, but outer “ribbon reefs” in the far north escaping damage., He said surveys this week in the central parts of the reef had found extensive bleaching at levels “comparable to 2017”, when it is estimated about 22% of shallow water coral along the reef’s 2300km died., Hughes said about 80 reefs between Tully and Townsville were badly bleached. Both inner and outer reefs were hit. “We could see that some of those corals were big enough that they must have survived the 2017 bleaching and now they re-bleached,” he said., Extreme #coral bleaching today, Central #GreatBarrierReef. Tomorrow, we'll assess reefs south of Townsville. pic.twitter.com/QLesCjAt3B, In more positive news, he said popular tourist spots between Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands had not been badly affected and would likely recover from mild bleaching. But some juvenile corals “about the size of dinner plates” had bleached in the central part of the reef, which he said would affect the pace at which the area recovered from previous bleaching events., Hughes said he was worried about corals in areas yet to be surveyed in the south. Those reefs had higher proportions of corals that were more susceptible to bleaching. “If they do bleach severely, we will see significant losses,” he said., In 2016 and 2017, there was no severe bleaching south of Hydrographers Passage, a natural shipping channel north-east of Mackay. Hughes said by late Tuesday they had surveyed about 10 reefs south of the passage and found all were severely bleached., Further south, at Heron Island, near Gladstone, researchers from the University of New South Wales have been monitoring bleaching since January. Associate Prof Tracey Ainsworth, from the centre for marine science and innovation, said shallow reefs around the island had “really suffered” after being left untouched in 2016 and 2017., “This is the year that the southern Great Barrier Reef has taken a bit of a hit,” she said., Ainsworth said reefs in deeper water had been less affected, but there had been near 100% impact in shallow lagoon areas that were exposed, or close to exposed, at low tide., “Pretty much everything in the shallows is bleached. There wasn’t a lot of difference between the species and there is quite a lot of mortality,” she said., While they were spared in 2016 and 2017, it is not the first time the reefs at Heron Island have bleached. They were significantly affected during localised bleaching in 2011. “I’ve been working on these shallows of nearly 20 years so it’s a real shame to see this coral bleaching… but it has been a relief to see it hasn’t affected all of the reef,” Ainsworth said., Hughes’ surveying team was preparing on Wednesday to fly from Mackay to observe about 200 reefs that make up the Swain and Pompey reef groups. On Thursday, they will fly over the Capricorn Bunker Group that includes the Heron Island research station. They will return to Mackay on Friday, taking a track farther offshore., Richard Leck, head of oceans at environment group WWF Australia, said the bleaching had hit Heron Island and surrounding areas when they had been “looking the best they had in decades”. “It’s really worrying,” he said., Leck said the GBRMPA had said limiting warming to 1.5C was the only hope for a safe outcome for the reef, but the federal government’s climate targets were consistent with double that. “We need a target for 1.5C and a realistic plan to get there,” he said., A five-yearly report by the major marine park authority last year found the reef’s outlook had deteriorated from poor to very poor, and warned the window of opportunity to improve its future was “now”., The latest mass bleaching comes as Unesco’s world heritage committee is scheduled to assess the reef’s status this year. It is the first time the committee will have considered the natural wonder’s world heritage status since the back-to-back bleaching events., It comes during an ongoing debate over how countries should manage the impact of the climate crisis on world heritage sites.

They will now be pushed back to 2021., A statement from the UN on Wednesday night confirmed that the meeting of over 26,000 attendees would be delayed until next year. It said new dates for the conference would be decided in due course., The UK energy minister and president of the Cop26 conference, Alok Sharma, held crunch talks with the UN and several other countries on Wednesday evening to confirm the timing of the summit. “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19. That is why we have decided to reschedule Cop26,” he said., “We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference.”, The Cop26 meeting was scheduled to be held in Glasgow at the SEC arena, a venue that the Scottish government plans to turn into a field hospital to treat virus victims., The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to delay the vital talks because of the widespread disruption caused by coronavirus, and will also delay a key preliminary meeting scheduled for Bonn, Germany, which was also expected to be derailed by widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions., John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said it was vital that the delay should not allow governments to back down on their commitments to tackle the climate crisis. “The decision to postpone the climate talks in Glasgow was inevitable given the health emergency the world is currently facing,” he told the Guardian. “But while the summit has been delayed, the climate emergency can’t be put on hold. Government stimulus packages will hold the key as to whether this emergency significantly delays or advances progress on tackling the climate emergency.”, Some campaigners believe there could be another advantage to delay, as the US presidential elections take place this November, just before Cop26 was scheduled to begin. With the summit delayed to next year, other governments will have time to adjust either to a second term of Donald Trump – who opposes the Paris agreement and is withdrawing the US from it – or a new president who is likely to support climate action., But several prominent climate experts had feared that delaying the talks would mean governments eased off on pursuing stronger commitments to fulfil the Paris goals., Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who oversaw the Paris summit in 2015, had argued for keeping Glasgow on track. On Wednesday night she accepted the delay but added: “Emissions must peak this year if we want to limit warming to 1.5C and the Paris agreement set the Cop26 summit as the moment when all countries would ramp up their targets in line with the steep emissions decline we need to see in this decisive next decade.”, The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) welcomed the delay as the best hope of rebuilding diplomatic momentum before the talks take place. Stephanie Pfeifer, the group’s CEO, said investors would support the decision because it “improves the likelihood of a strong outcome and ensuring that the world is put on a path to tackle the climate crisis”., But the delay will come as a blow to some climate campaigners, who have urged the UK government to proceed with the conference despite the outbreak to avoid stalling progress on global climate action. They believe since the Paris agreement, countries have failed to develop climate commitments that go far enough to avoid a catastrophic environmental breakdown.

It reports rebounding sea life, from humpback whales off Australia to elephant seals in the US and green turtles in Japan., Through rampant overfishing, pollution and coastal destruction, humanity has inflicted severe damage on the oceans and its inhabitants for centuries. But conservation successes, while still isolated, demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the seas., The scientists say there is now the knowledge to create an ocean renaissance for wildlife by 2050 and with it bolster the services that the world’s people rely on, from food to coastal protection to climate stability. The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high., However, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels., “We have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,” said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. “Failing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.”, Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review’s international team, said: “Overfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration., “One of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back. We can turn the oceans around and we know it makes sense economically, for human wellbeing and, of course, for the environment.”, The review, published in the journal Nature, found that global fishing is slowly becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In places from Tampa Bay, Florida to the Philippines, the habitats are being restored., Among the success stories are humpback whales that migrate from Antarctica to eastern Australia, whose populations have surged from a few hundred animals in 1968, before whaling was banned, to more than 40,000 today. Sea otters in western Canada have risen from just dozens in 1980 to thousands now. In the Baltic Sea, both grey seal and cormorant populations are soaring., “We’re beginning to appreciate the value of what we’re losing and not just in terms of intrinsic beauty of the wildlife but in terms of protecting our livelihoods and societies from bad things happening, whether that be poor water quality in rivers and oceans or sea level rise beating on the doorstep of coastal areas,” said Roberts., However, progress is far from straightforward. Pollution from farms and plastics still pours into the oceans, the waters are reaching record high temperatures, and destructive fishing is still taking place in many places, with at least one-third of fish stocks overexploited., “The Mediterranean is still pretty much a basket case,” said Roberts. “And there is horrendous overfishing throughout large parts of south-east Asia and India, where fisheries are just catching anything they trawl on the seabed to render into fish meal and oil.”, The global heating of the oceans has driven the few hundred surviving northern right whales along the coast of the western Atlantic. Here, amid busy shipping lanes and lobster fisheries, they are killed by collisions or drowned in a tangle of ropes, according to Roberts, though new regulations are starting to help., The Gulf of Mexico suffers massive dead zones owing to huge amounts of manure and fertiliser running off midwest farms, and elsewhere albatrosses continue to be snared by long-line fishers, despite simple solutions being available., But examples of the benefits of restorative habits were growing, Roberts said, from the return of once abundant oyster beds that can clean huge volumes of water, to marine protected areas that can boost fishery catches nearby, such as by the Scottish island of Arran., “When I started working on the science of marine protected areas in the early 1990s. it was very much a niche interest,” said Roberts. “Now it’s being discussed at the top level internationally and we have many countries signing up to expand protection to 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, with the UK among the early adopters of the target.” Marine protected areas have risen from 0.9% of the ocean in 2000 to 7.4% now, though not all are fully implemented., The scientists’s review concludes that restoring the oceans by 2050 is a grand challenge that, with a global redoubling of conservation efforts, can be achieved: “Meeting the challenge would be a historic milestone in humanity’s quest to achieve a globally sustainable future.”oceans can be restored to former glory within 30 years say scientists", "label": 0}, "train-573": {"text": "\nWhat wildlife can you see from your home?\n, If you are locked down in an urban area due to coronavirus, we want to know what flora and fauna you can see from your home, \nGuardian community team, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 09.31 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Apr 2020 09.32 EDT\n\n, Locked down in a city?

Now, he is the only one left. , As he travels from ship to ship, he now dons disposable gloves, keeps two metres from the crew and stops at the top of the gangway, rather than enter vessels. But he doesn’t wear a face mask: he feels it is important to show his face., “They are anxious and lonely,” Woodward, a chaplain for the Mission to Seafarers, told the Guardian. “One seafarer almost cried when I told him I was the last chaplain still visiting ships in the port. He was a seafarer from the Philippines and, like myself, had two small children. He was misty-eyed. He was checking in daily with his family, but coronavirus is also in the Philippines and they are thousands of miles away.”, The port is vital to the global supply chain of food, medicine and other goods, and many of the seafarers who work the container ships have not been ashore in months – and may not be able to land for some time yet., “They are tough guys and they tend not to show it, but you can see it in their eyes,” says Woodward. “They are anxious. Their families are often thousands of miles away, in countries that are in lockdown. At this time, what they can’t offer their families is protection. That is what they are worried about. We are all human and this is a big unknown.”, Anxiety is growing among crews. Some have reported non-payment of wages, or contracts being extended without consent. Other seafarers have been stranded in foreign ports without wages or flights home. , Shipping organisations and seafarers unions are urging governments to make travel easier for ships’ crews, amid reports of thousands of seamen becoming stranded on their vessels after their contracts have ended, due to coronavirus restrictions and a lack of international flights. , In normal circumstances, Woodward, a dual British-Dutch national who was ordained in Cambridge and lives with his wife and two children in Schiedam, in the Netherlands, would offer seafarers a trip ashore to the supermarket to get supplies, a much-needed sim card to stay in touch with family, or pastoral support., “Now, I try to have a brief conversation – about how grateful we are for their work keeping global supply chains open. I say, I’m here to say thank you and unfortunately, then I will have to leave you. I’m unable to have the in-depth pastoral conversations we usually have,” he says., In recent weeks, Woodward has visited seafarers from the Philippines, India, Russia, the Ukraine and Romania., “Most people don’t realise it but these seafarers are essential workers,” he says. “Our heroes are the nurses and doctors, in the NHS and elsewhere – but without seafarers, how would the supermarkets work? We know that medical supplies and groceries are coming out of the port. If all that stopped … it is unimaginable.”, Without seafarers, how would the supermarkets work?, This week the UK became the first country to recognise seafarers as “key workers” , following pressure from the international chamber of shipping, the UK chamber of shipping, transport unions and maritime charities., Earlier this month, Woodward received a WhatsApp message from a seaman from Mindanao, in the Philippines, who was desperate to see his wife and daughter, now in lockdown. The man’s contract, on a vessel sailing in the Mediterranean, had ended in December and was extended for a month – but after Covid-19 struck, requests from the ship to countries including Turkey and Israel to allow it to dock were turned down., He has now been at sea for a year., “This has become a real issue, with many seafarers finding themselves trapped onboard their vessel, not allowed to disembark by their companies, the port state or the flag state,” Woodward says. “This needs urgent intervention and a sustainable solution, before it’s too late.”, Woodward will continue his work as long as it’s safe, he says. On Monday he visited five ships and distributed bags to the men, containing woolly hats, bibles and hand-written cards from children thanking the seafarers for their work. These gifts have touched many, he said, including a Filipino father of two he met last week., “He was blown away,” Woodward recalls. “He just said, ‘Wow’.

They airlines are worried about survival and will need lots of support, lots of liquidity – that gives them a big responsibility.”, A group of 26 civil society groups in the UK have written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, demanding “stringent conditions” on any rescue, including strict targets on greenhouse gases in line with the Paris agreement and measures to help workers. “Public money must be used to address social and environmental priorities, as well as economic needs,” they wrote., Aviation has all but ceased in some countries and flights are vastly down in most others, owing to the lockdowns and other suppression measures. Airlines have been appealing to governments for bailouts as fleets have been grounded., But campaigners and experts fear that after the Covid-19 outbreak has waned, the sector could bounce back with the aid of public money and send emissions soaring., In their letter to the chancellor, the campaigners – including Greenpeace, Flight Free, the IPPR and New Economics Foundation thinktanks, and Tax Justice – call for the government to take equity stakes in airlines rather than handing out cash or loans. They want to see social benefits with workers’ rights enforced, including a living wage and no mass redundancies a condition of any rescue. In the longer term, they want to see support for a “just transition” for workers to move to jobs in lower carbon industries., They also want a new fiscal regime that includes a frequent flyer levy or air miles levy, replacing air passenger duty, which would reduce demand without removing access to flights from those with limited alternatives or limited resources, by shifting the tax burden to frequent leisure flyers. About half of people in the UK do not fly in any given year, but 1% of people take a fifth of all flights., Rebecca Newsom, head of political affairs at Greenpeace UK, said: “Emergency funding must be used to tackle emergencies, not to support business as usual. Conditions are needed to protect workers’ rights, prevent public money from being diverted into the pockets of shareholders, and reduce demand gradually over time through a frequent flier levy, so that the sector operates within safe limits for the climate.”, Attaching conditions to any bailout could take several forms. Cañete wants to see a carbon tax or emissions trading system such as the one operating under the EU. “Market mechanisms are needed,” he said., Airlines UK, a trade body, said the industry was already taking steps to reduce their environmental impact before the coronavirus crisis hit. “The UK aviation sector has already committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – the only national aviation industry to do so,” said a spokesperson. “This will be achieved via a range of measures, including airspace modernisation, the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels, new cleaner planes, and the UN carbon offsetting scheme Corsia.”, Airlines face difficult choices ahead. More efficient aircraft will help to reduce emissions, but the impact will be limited. Biofuels offer a possible answer, but they are still expensive and there are difficulties in ensuring that the sources are environmentally sustainable. Electric planes are still some way in the future, and solar-powered flight a distant dream., “We need to stimulate research and development into things like hydrogen fuel,” said Barbara Buchner, managing director of the Climate Policy Initiative. “We need more proactive thinking from airlines – they can’t imagine we will go back to the way they were before.”, The coronavirus disruption may also bring about permanent changes in people’s habits, some experts hope. Business flying has stopped meetings from happening, but people have found ways to work with video conferencing and other cheap technology, forcing businesses to question whether their staff need to fly as much in future., These eight companies are among those who will help you offset your carbon emissions.

Under the Corsia (Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) system adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, airlines would have to curb their future emissions using efficiencies, alternative fuels and offsetting, such as investing in forests, renewable energy or other carbon-cutting projects., Before the coronavirus crisis emerged, airlines pushed for the average emissions in the years 2019 and 2020 to be used as the baseline by which future emissions would be judged. In any years from 2021 onwards, when emissions from the sector exceed the average of 2019 and 2020, the difference between actual emissions and the baseline will have to be offset, meaning airlines will have to buy carbon credits from carbon-cutting projects., Choosing 2019 and 2020 should have made those targets easy to meet for airlines if air travel had continued to rise this year as it has in recent years. With the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the disruption to travel means emissions are likely to be drastically lower than envisaged for 2020 – meaning Corsia’s future carbon targets will be much tougher for them to reach, if the scheme goes ahead without changes.financial help for airlines should come with strict climate conditions", "label": 0}, "train-576": {"text": "\n'The losses could be profound': how floods are wreaking havoc on wildlife\n, \n'The losses could be profound': how floods are wreaking havoc on wildlife\n,  As rivers and wildflower meadows in the UK struggle to recover from repeated flooding, the ecosystems they support are collapsing, \nPhoebe Weston, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 02.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Apr 2020 07.36 EDT\n\n, For 900 years, Lugg and Hampton wildflower meadows in Herefordshire have bloomed into a wash of colour in spring. These fertile meadows were highly prized, and the Norman lords who owned them used the hay crop to help fund Hereford’s cathedrals, churches and castles. The secret to their wonderful bounty was the River Lugg flowing through the middle, fertilising the valley floor with lime and silt each winter it flooded., But this longstanding system is broken. This winter the valley was submerged under several feet of chocolate-coloured water. It has been flooded almost continuously since October, turning the 120-hectare (297-acre) reserve into an inland lake, with just the tops of gates and fence posts peeping out of the water. Now, as spring approaches, the water is still several inches deep and swans and gulls frolic where mice and rabbits would have burrowed six months earlier., The damage flooding does to humans has been well-documented, but wildlife populations are unseen casualties, with some ecosystems taking decades to recover. “It is frightening to think that we have only just begun to see what might be ahead with our climate. The losses could be profound,” says James Hitchcock from Herefordshire Wildlife Trust, which manages the Lugg reserve., “The rate of change we are seeing and the repetition in extreme events is coming too fast for wildlife to adapt … The loss of these meadows could take years and years to reverse and we may never see a return of some species.”, Months of flooding is turning Lugg meadows anoxic as oxygen is lost. Worms and other insects suffocate and come to the surface where they are picked off by scavengers such as foxes and crows, reducing the larder of food for rarer species that rely on the reserve in spring. Many delicate grass species like vernal grass and red fescue are likely to be weakened by the floods, leaving a flush of resistant weed species such as thuggish dock leaves and thistles to take their place. In 2012, conservationists resorted to weedkiller to get rid of the dock leaves because the valley had been too wet., These meadows are highly valuable sites of  special  scientific  interest (SSSIs) and were home to Herefordshire’s only fledged curlew chick last year. Curlews and other ground-nesting birds such as skylarks and reed buntings will have nowhere to nest unless the water subsides in the next week or so. The rare solitary red-shanked carder bee, which nests in mouseholes in tussocky vegetation, could already be wiped out. If flooding becomes too frequent, meticulously managed flood plains like this turn into swamps., The casualties are far-reaching – otters that live in the Lugg have been killed on roads after being forced into areas where there is less cover. Kingfisher nests normally built into the muddy banks have been submerged under several feet of water. Soil in the water also chokes filter feeders such as dragonfly and damsel larva., The decline of this rural valley, once rich in meaning and memories, is part of what Hitchcock calls the “homogenisation of the countryside”. All over the country, generalist species like rooks, crows and gulls thrive at the expense of specialised species that are picky about their habitat. Only around 1,200 hectares of species-rich flood plain meadows remain in the whole of the UK, with most of them lost due to the intensification of agriculture. Many of these rare species have nowhere to migrate to if their habitat is destroyed., “This flooding is one element in a general narrative of decline. When flooding is this prolonged, insects and vertebrates start to die and that includes things like earthworms. It then takes years to recover. In that intervening period you have less food for birds and potentially the loss of some species. Everything is getting hit from every angle,” says Hitchcock., Farther down the Lugg at Bodenham Lake, prolonged flooding may have drowned 1,500 young reeds, planted in 2019 as part of a £520,000 project managed by the Herefordshire Wildlife Trust to create more habitats for declining wetland species such as warblers and bearded tits., Sophie Cowling, senior project officer at Lugg Living Landscape, says: “The lake’s water levels have been extremely high since the end of October, due to repeated flooding. The floodwaters have fully submerged the young reed plants; if they drown it will be costly to replace them and the conservation of declining wildlife that relies on reedbeds will be delayed by several years.”, Thirty miles south-west is the village of Llanwenarth in the Abergavenny district in Monmouthshire, Wales. Two 16th-century manor houses and a church perched on land raised from the flood plain are a nod to former rural communities that once thrived in these valleys. The 16th-century houses had never flooded until earlier this year when they had three feet of water running through. The damage to the valley exceeded the three previous large floods in 1853, 1947 and 1979., Fortunately these floods were not at a time when fish were spawning but their regularity worries Simon Evans, chief executive of the Wye and Usk Foundation. “In the Usk we’ve had record floods in 2018, 2019 and now in 2020. That’s three massive floods in the last 20 months. Imagine each one as a bang on the ecology – if you keep hitting it it just goes away. Rivers just cannot survive flood after flood after flood.”, Fast-moving water causes gravel at the bottom of rivers – which is key for river ecosystems – to be ripped away and spat out farther downstream. Macroinvertebrates such as bull head, stone larch and marsh brown lose their homes, says Evans. “These animals are the life-support systems in the river. They provide food for the dippers and the fish, which provide food for the kingfisher, so if you don’t have the macroinvertebrates because you have taken away their houses then your whole ecology is done.”, On a tributary of the Llynfi, only the red bedrock is visible and the gravel patches where salmon and trout previously spawned have washed away. A single flood can impact populations for decades to come; the 1977 flood at Selkirk in the Scottish Borders washed away salmon eggs that had just been laid in the gravel and the effects were apparent on spring salmon catches in the River Tweed 25 years later, according to Evans., In September 2012 more than 200,000 tonnes of soil left the Lugg in one flood, the equivalent of 26 hectares of top soil. There is up to 150mg of soil per litre of water in many of these rivers, and roads are visibly stained red after the water has subsided. This is caused by water flooding agricultural land – much of which is bare after being harvested for maize or root vegetables – and washing valuable topsoil into rivers. This soil is often doused in pesticides and fertilisers which cause additional damage to river ecosystems., “Our rivers are not adapted to these elevated sediment loads, and our ecology is not adapted to elevated sediment loads. We should not see big brown rivers sliding past but what we see is big brown rivers sliding past and that’s because of how we manage our land. We’ve got this shifting baselines thing going on – people think the Lugg has always been brown but it hasn’t,” says Evans., Eggs in the gravel rely on flowing water to bring them oxygen and remove waste, but soil blocks up these holes and reduces the amount of water reaching the eggs, meaning they can suffocate and die. It also reduces visibility so river creatures cannot hunt so easily., Historically these traditional farming communities would have been centres for human trade, migration and settlement, but the battle to control water is dividing communities. Tris Pearce, an ecologist and trustee of the Badger Trust, grew up in the Welsh borders where the Severn and Vyrnwy rivers meet. He monitors badger setts near Pentre, Shrewsbury, which sits close to the border between England and Wales. Here, the roads have turned into rivers intersected with islands of tarmac. Some areas have been underwater for more than three and a half months., For badgers, late winter storms come at the worst time because cubs are in underground dens and will drown unless the sow can get them out (which she does by picking them up in her mouth one by one). Pearson feels increasingly concerned about the future of these valleys for both the wildlife and people that live here. His parents were farmers and Pearson kept livestock himself but two years ago turned vegan due to concerns about the environmental impacts of livestock farming., “Climate change is the big thing. We can’t keep ignoring it. You look up at the overgrazed hillside from six feet of water and everything you can see is being propped up by government money. It’s not sustainable. This prolonged flooding is starting to turn into an annual event – it was once in a lifetime, then once every decade and now it’s all the time.”, Samantha Somers, environment manager at Natural England, says the organisation will continue to support natural flood management measures, including creating space for temporary ponds and restoring rivers., “Recent flooding unfortunately caused significant distress and disruption for communities and businesses. However as flooding is a natural process, flood plains can generally continue to support ecosystems which are rich in wildlife and can accommodate floodwaters when rivers burst their banks,” she says., Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresthe losses could be profound how floods are wreaking havoc on wildlife aoe", "label": 0}, "train-577": {"text": "\nWill the coronavirus kill the oil industry and help save the climate?\n, \nWill the coronavirus kill the oil industry and help save the climate?\n, Analysts say the coronavirus and a savage price war means the oil and gas sector will never be the same again, \nDamian Carrington, \nJillian Ambrose and \nMatthew Taylor, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 02.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Apr 2020 17.51 EDT\n\n, The plunging demand for oil wrought by the coronavirus pandemic combined with a savage price war has left the fossil fuel industry broken and in survival mode, according to analysts. It faces the gravest challenge in its 100-year history, they say, one that will permanently alter the industry. With some calling the scene a “hellscape”, the least lurid description is “unprecedented”., A key question is whether this will permanently alter the course of the climate crisis. Many experts think it might well do so, pulling forward the date at which demand for oil and gas peaks, never to recover, and allowing the atmosphere to gradually heal., The boldest say peak fossil fuel demand may have been dragged into the here and now, and that 2019 will go down in history as the peak year for carbon emissions. But some take an opposing view: the fossil fuel industry will bounce back as it always has, and bargain basement oil prices will slow the much-needed transition to green energy., Who is right depends on a heady mix of geopolitics, profit, investor sentiment, government bailouts and net zero emissions targets, campaigner pressures and, not least, consumer behaviour – is virtual working, for instance, the new normal?, What is beyond doubt is the carnage in the sector. The lowest oil prices for almost two decades, with worse potentially on the way. Some oil major stock market valuations halved since January. At least two-thirds of annual investment – $130bn – dumped and tens of thousands of job losses. In a few markets prices have gone negative – sellers will pay you to take the oil, as global storage capacity fills., “The price war and Covid-19 have really thrown the oil and gas sector into turmoil, and now we have companies really in survival mode,” said Valentina Kretzschmar, director of corporate research at analysts Wood Mackenzie., Oil wells responsible for almost 1m barrels a day may have already been shut down because the price of oil is now lower than the cost of shipping it, according to US banking giant Goldman Sachs, with the number of wells growing “by the hour”. This is likely to “permanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics” and “shift the debate around climate change”, said Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities at the bank., Demand for oil has plummeted as the coronavirus locks down people in their homes and airplanes on runways. “The virus will bring forward peak demand for fossil fuels,” said Kingsmill Bond, at analysts Carbon Tracker. This latest cyclical oil shock is hitting an industry already heading towards a structural peak created by nations committing to net zero future emissions, he said., “As for the impact of the virus on the timing of peak demand, it depends of course on the severity,” he said. In 2018, Carbon Tracker estimated peak demand would come in 2023 but Bond said it was possible that the crisis has advanced this by three years. “That means that peak emissions was almost certainly 2019, and perhaps peak fossil fuels as well,” he said. “It will be touch and go if there can be another mini-peak in 2022, before the inexorable decline begins.”, While the oil companies themselves have long argued peak demand is too far off to put a number on, most observers thought it would happen this decade. Mark Lewis, head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas, agreed the crises could bring it closer., “When the dust settles, the peak demand narrative will be there stronger than ever,” he said. “This is particularly true if long-haul aviation fails to recover. This has been a very strong source of oil demand growth in recent years but the longer we are at home – remote working, using video conferencing – the more people will wonder: do we really need to get on a plane?”, The oil price plunge has also demolished the lucrative returns on exploration projects to which investors have become accustomed. This threatens what Lewis calls the “golden dividend era” of the last two decades, which has made oil stocks mainstays of portfolios., Wood Mackenzie last week analysed the impact of an oil price of $35 on companies’ previous investment plans for 2020. “It’s a very, very ugly picture,” said Kretzschmar. “At $35 per barrel, 75% of projects don’t even cover the cost of capital.”, Most strikingly, the fat rates of return projected for the oil and gas projects have slumped from about 20% down to 6%, she said. “They’re very much in line now with what you can get from solar and wind projects.”, “The oil and gas sector is already a very much unloved sector by investors and in this kind of oil price environment, it becomes low return, high risk and high carbon,” Kretzschmar said. “It is not a very attractive proposition.” With oil prices predicted by some to collapse even further, Kretzschmar is blunt: “At $20 the industry will be decimated.”, The oil industry was already under pressure from investors concerned about the climate crisis and increasing regulation from governments to cut emissions. Colin Melvin, at Arkadiko Partners, a consultancy advising some of the world’s biggest investment management and pension funds, said that after the crisis he expects investment to flow increasingly towards companies perceived to offer wider social benefits., “The purpose of the investment of capital in business is to create wellbeing, to create wealth in the true sense, and I think that is going to become more and more relevant to investors,” he said., Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England pensions board, said the implications for the oil and gas sector could be significant. “Demand reduction could be the catalyst for rapid change and I think investors are going to look at long term systemic challenges very closely and want to see much greater resilience.”, As well as climate concerns, the wild instability of the oil markets provoked by the crises may also deter investors, according to analysis from the University of Oxford’s Institute for Energy Studies: “This is a market that is being tested to its limits.”, However, not all experts think the oil industry’s loss is necessarily a gain for green energy and the climate. “If anything it may hold up the share of oil for longer, because it’s cheaper. It could be bad news from a climate point of view,” said Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at the University of Oxford., He said securing a green economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis will require deliberate policy measures from governments: “This is where the carbon tax comes in. Now is the moment.”, Governments are deploying stupendous sums to stimulate the coronavirus-wracked global economy - $5 trillion from the G20 nations alone - but how it is disbursed remains uncertain. European Union leaders have promised to make their emergency measures align with their Green Deal programme and Fatih Birol, executive director at the International Energy Agency, has said there is an “historic opportunity” to pour investment into energy technologies that cut greenhouse gas emissions., But the $2tn US coronavirus relief package is doling out $60bn to struggling airlines and offering low-interest loans that are available to fossil fuel companies, without requiring any action to stem the climate emergency. The Canadian government has said it will give loans to its oil companies, who say they are on “life support”., After the 2008 global financial crisis, there were high hopes that the trillions of dollars delivered at that time would green the economy, but fossil fuels and their emissions powered on, ever upwards. Bond said: “The big difference to 2008 is that the cost of renewables is now below that of fossil fuels. There is no point trying to sustain the unsustainable high-cost fossil assets in any event. It would be deeply ironic for neoliberal advocates of Ayn Rand to ask for a government bailout.”, Adrienne Buller, an economist at the Common Wealth thinktank, said governments in countries like the UK, US and Canada should now consider nationalising major oil corporations., “Fossil fuel companies won’t be allowed to fail en masse.,  Any bailout should at a bare minimum come with equivalent public stakes in the companies, and strong conditions for environmental and climate protections and a transition away from fossil fuel production., “However, given the intent of acquiring this stake should be to wind down production as rapidly as feasible while ensuring a just transition for workers and security of energy supply, nationalisation may be more appropriate and pragmatic.”, The global industry trade body, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, insists its members have a vital role after the pandemic. “Oil and gas play a significant role in the global energy mix and will do so in the future,” said a spokesman. “It is too early to predict what the midterm impact will be. But the oil and gas industry has a history of successfully responding to difficult situations and we anticipate that it will adapt as it has before.”, “Furthermore, the industry has been a key engine of prosperity and a driver of innovation for many decades,” he said. “It has the experience, skills, knowledge and resources needed to realise a low-emissions energy future - a transition that would be more difficult and more expensive without it.”, Adding fuel to the fire of the pandemic is the price war being waged by Saudi Arabia and Russia, who increased production just as the pandemic slashed demand, sending prices towards the floor. The moves are seen as an attempt to grab market share by killing the higher cost producers behind the US shale boom., Prof Bernard Haykel, at Princeton University, US, said it also reflects a more fundamental strategic shift led by Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman: “With a global clean-energy transition inevitable, he is desperate to cash out while the Kingdom still can.”, The lasting impact of the price war depends on how long Saudi Arabia and Russia can keep pumping cheap oil. While their production costs are very low, they depend on high revenues to balance their national budgets., Michael Liebreich, at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the fiscal break-even for Saudi Arabia is around $80 per barrel, meaning its foreign exchange reserves might sustain rock-bottom oil prices for only two or three years. “Russia, with a $40 a barrel fiscal break-even and much more diversified economy, can survive low oil prices for a decade,” he said., Whatever happens, the industry will never be the same again after the double whammy of the pandemic and price war. “The companies that emerge from the crisis will not be the ones that went into it,” said Carbon Tracker’s Bond. “We will see write-downs, restructuring and radical change.”, Experts, including Currie at Goldman Sachs, say the climate change debate will almost certainly take a difference course after the crisis. But exactly what that looks like remains to be seen. “The question is how long this is all going to last, and no one really knows,” said Kretzschmar.the fossil fuel industry is broken will a cleaner climate be the result", "label": 0}, "train-578": {"text": "\nLabour candidates set out detailed plans for tackling climate crisis\n, Lisa Nandy, Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey answer 17 questions put by the Guardian, \nMatthew Taylor Environment correspondent, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 02.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Apr 2020 02.03 EDT\n\n, Transforming the energy efficiency of every home, mass rewilding of the countryside, huge investment in cycling, walking and buses, and a “frequent flyer” tax are among a raft of green policies being put forward by the politicians vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour party., In answers to 17 questions put by the Guardian before the coronavirus outbreak, all three remaining candidates – Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Keir Starmer – set out detailed plans on how they would go about tackling the dual environmental crises of climate breakdown and mass extinction, and shed light on how the party under their leadership would tackle some of the biggest challenges facing the UK, and the world., In the 2019 election, the climate crisis was more prominent than it has been in any previous contest, and voters and green campaigners are increasingly putting pressure on the leadership candidates to stick to the ambition of the Labour manifesto, which for the first time put tackling the climate emergency at the heart of its offer., Earlier this year, the Labour for a Green New Deal group, which campaigned for the party to adopt a radical economic plan to deal with the crisis in the run-up to the election, sent five questions to each candidate and scored their answers out of 10: Long-Bailey came out on top, with Starmer second and Nandy third., The Guardian also scored all MPs on their record on the climate crisis as part of The polluters series last year. In that analysis, Long-Bailey and Nandy both came out with the maximum score of 100%. Starmer had only been present for two votes, meaning there was insufficient information for him to be given a score., In a clear sign of how deeply embedded a radical environmental agenda has become in Labour policy, all three candidates, answering before the Covid 19 outbreak said the climate crisis was the biggest challenge facing the UK. Both Long-Bailey and Nandy highlighted their previous experience – Long-Bailey as the architect of Labour’s Green New Deal at the last election and Nandy from her time as the party’s shadow energy secretary and her role leading Labour’s team at the Paris climate talks in 2015., All the candidates pledged broad support for Labour’s comprehensive Green New Deal agenda. Both Long-Bailey and Starmer supported the specifics of the plan set out in the 2019 manifesto, spelling out how the UK could rapidly decarbonise the economy and create hundreds of thousands of secure, unionised green jobs., Starmer said the project should be “hardwired” into everything a future Labour government did “from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing”, and he flagged up the role of the “green transformation fund and a national investment bank” to pay for it., Long-Bailey said that under her leadership Labour would organise and pay for such an ambitious scheme through public ownership and investment in the energy system to ensure “extra costs are not loaded onto homes that can’t afford it”., Nandy did not commit to the details of the plan but agreed there needed to be “a wholesale transformation” in the way homes and businesses were powered and heated, adding that “this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities”., Asked whether they would commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building, Long-Bailey said she would, saying it was necessary not just to tackle the climate crisis, but to improve “our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air.”, Neither Nandy nor Starmer specifically committed to spending more on public transport, walking and cycling than roads although both said they would increase investment in those areas., Nandy said she would nationalise the railways and hand over control of buses to local councils so they were run “for people not profit”., Starmer said the government had made a “political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport”., He added: “I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system – with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians.”, All the candidates expressed interest in a frequent flyer tax to ensure that the 15% of wealthy UK residents who are estimated to take 70% of domestic and international flights pay more for the environmental damage they cause., Nandy said she would look to “make the system fairer and greener”. Long-Bailey said it was right to “ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights”., Starmer said the tax system should encourage people to use alternatives to flying., All three said they were opposed to expansion at Heathrow and were sceptical about aviation expansion elsewhere in light of the UK’s legal commitments to reduce carbon emissions., None of the candidates came out against nuclear power. Long-Bailey said she supported it where necessary for the UK’s “energy security”. Nandy said that the middle of a climate emergency was the wrong time to rule it out definitively. Starmer said nuclear power should be “part of the mix” in the transition away from fossil fuels, but the “overwhelming focus” should be on renewables., Asked whether they would support policies to reduce red meat consumption, Nandy said the focus should be on the fossil fuel industry. “The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food.”, Long-Bailey highlighted the growing number of people who are cutting down on red meat “as people think about the environment and their health”, but stopped short of any specific policy commitments., Starmer acknowledged that the meat and dairy sector was “one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, deforestation”, adding that everyone should think about how to reduce their consumption., But he added: “Changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change.”, Nandy said tackling the climate emergency went “hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment”. She backed Labour’s existing policy of creating 10 new national nature parks, adding: “I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them.”, Starmer agreed rewilding was an essential part of the “fightback against the climate and environmental emergency”., “I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets.”, Long-Bailey also backed Labour’s existing plans to create new parks and rewild existing ones, as well as “natural corridors” across the country., “These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about.”labour leadership candidates set out detailed plans for tackling climate crisis", "label": 0}, "train-579": {"text": "\n'Really amazing': scientists show that fish migrate through the deep oceans\n, Analysis of underwater photographs has demonstrated what marine biologists have long suspected – seasonal fish migrations, Ian Evans, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 10.35 EDT\n\n, New research has finally demonstrated what many marine biologists suspected but had never before seen: fish migrating through the deep sea., The study, published this month in the Journal of Animal Ecology, used analysis of deep-sea photographs to show a regular increase in the number of fish in particular months, suggesting seasonal migrations., Tracking fish in the deep sea is challenging. They are sparsely distributed, the water is nearly devoid of sunlight, and the monitoring equipment has to withstand enormous pressure., The study used photographs taken by the Deep-ocean Environmental Long-term Observatory System (Delos), two observatories on the sea bed 1,400m below the surface, off the coast of Angola. The researchers analysed 12,703 photographs – only 502 of which had actually managed to capture a fish – taken over seven-and-a-half years, and found that each year, in late November and June, there was a spike in the number of fish., “It is certainly not unprecedented but it has never really been demonstrated,” says Rosanna Milligan, an assistant professor at Nova Southeastern University in Florida and the lead author on the paper. “That is what we were able to do with this study.”, “Even after all these years, one of my favourite parts of being a scientist is when you do those first graphs of your results and start to see something emerging from the data,” says David Bailey, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow and a co-author on the paper. “That’s one of the greatest thrills of the whole scientific endeavour. It was really, really amazing.”, Even with this new discovery, Milligan and Bailey still say there is a lot they don’t know., “The natural thing to do is to find out where the fish are coming from and going to when they move around,” says Bailey. “What is going on? What does it mean and what are the fish doing?”, Very little is known about the behaviour of any of the fish photographed. Grenadiers, a family of fish seen in more than 100 of the Delos photos, have long tails that may allow them to move great distances at low speed – but despite being a relatively common deep-sea fish, little information exists on how far they can swim. A 1992 paper, for instance, put acoustic tracking devices in bait and fed them to grenadiers, but the devices only tracked the fish up to 1km away., Milligan thinks the fish might be migrating to follow dying organisms on the surface. Plankton blooms off the coast of west Africa every year four months before the deep-sea fish migrate into the area. Given that the deep sea is dependent on life at the surface that dies and sinks to the bottom, it is possible that other animals could be gathering to take advantage of the dying plankton, and the deep-sea fish migrate to eat those., “We just have no idea how these things act,” says Tim O’Hara, a researcher and senior curator of marine zoology at Museums Victoria, Australia, who was not involved in the research. “We are literally groping in the dark. It’s kilometres down in the ocean and we get these tiny bits of information from one or two locations and we’re trying to put together a big picture.”, Milligan and Bailey hope this discovery encourages other researchers to look for similar patterns in the deep oceans., “Maybe if we had more of this level of surveillance in other places, we would find fish migrations in all kinds of places,” says Bailey. “It’s just that Angola is where we happened to be observing in this level of detail for this amount of time … This could be happening all over the place.”really amazing scientists show that fish migrate through the deep oceans", "label": 0}, "train-580": {"text": "\nGovernment set to make decision on UK's largest coalmine\n, Verdict expected after four years of protracted talks as production of the fossil fuel fell to record lows of 2.9m tonnes , \nJillian Ambrose, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 01.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Apr 2020 02.25 EDT\n\n, Ministers will decide this month whether to give the green light to plans for the UK’s largest coalmine after years of fierce opposition from environmentalists., A letter from the government’s lawyers, seen by the Guardian, said the government will draw a line on the protracted battle to develop an opencast mine at Highthorn in Northumberland by giving a verdict on the plans by Tuesday 7 April., The decision is expected over four years after the Banks Group, a Durham-based infrastructure firm, first put forward its plans to produce 3m tonnes of coal from the opencast mine for Britain’s steel and cement sector., The company’s lawyers wrote to the government earlier this month demanding a decision on the “vital” coal project, saying it could help meet the “important national need for industrial coal”., A spokesman for the company added that the “corona crisis” could threaten the UK’s imports, although there is no evidence that coal shipments have been impacted so far., The UK’s reliance on coal to generate electricity has fallen to record lows in recent years but the fossil fuel is still used to make steel and manufacture cement, requiring imports of coal from Russia and the US., The UK used 7.9m tonnes of coal last year, down by a third from the year before according to official figures, while domestic coal production fell to record lows of 2.9m tonnes., Environmentalists are strongly opposed to the plans to open new mines in the UK while it moves towards a ban on coal-fired electricity from 2025., Tony Bosworth, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It is distastefully opportunistic to use a public health crisis to argue for a new coalmine.”, “Coronavirus is rightly the world’s priority right now, but that doesn’t mean we can afford to make another crisis worse. And to deal with the climate emergency we need to leave the vast majority of the world’s coal in the ground,” he added., The plan was rejected two years ago by Sajid Javid, the former minister for communities and local government, after an 18-month review concluded that the environmental impact of the mine would outweigh its economic benefits., The decision was overturned by the High Court eight months later after a judge ruled that Javid’s reasoning for disregarding the support of the planning inspectorate, which backed the project, was “significantly inadequate”., The Banks Group argues that mining coal domestically would have a smaller carbon footprint than importing coal by sea and rail.

But the much-celebrated small bird with a beautiful song may be increasingly endangered because its wings are getting shorter., The nightingale makes an epic journey from sub-Saharan Africa to breed in Europe each summer but there are barely 7,000 nesting pairs left in England., Spanish researchers examining wing sizes of two nightingale populations in central Spain have found that the average wing length relative to their body size has fallen over the past two decades. Shorter-winged birds were found to be less likely to return to their breeding grounds after their first trip to Africa., According to a new study published in The Auk: Ornithological Advances, natural selection driven by climate change is causing the birds to evolve with shorter wings., In recent decades, the timing of spring has shifted in central Spain and summer droughts have become longer and more intense, leaving the nightingales a shorter window in which to raise their young., Scientists believe that there is a suite of adaptations that make the nightingales effective migratory birds including a long wingspan, a larger clutch size and a shorter lifespan, which are controlled by a set of linked genes. This means that selective pressure on one trait also affects the other features., If the pressure of drought is leading the most successful birds to lay smaller clutches of eggs, with fewer young to feed, then it could be causing these nightingales to also lose the other linked traits that make them such effective migrants. This is an example of “maladaptation” where species’ responses to cope with changing conditions end up causing them harm., “There is much evidence that climate change is having an effect on migratory birds, changing their arrival and laying dates and their physical features over the last few decades,” said lead author Carolina Remacha of Complutense University of Madrid., “If we are to fully understand how bird populations adapt to new environments in order to help them tackle the challenges of a rapidly changing world, it is important to call attention to the potential problems of maladaptive change.”nightingales at risk due to shorter wings caused by climate crisis", "label": 0}, "train-582": {"text": "\n'It warms the heart': Navajo mount grassroots effort to tackle coronavirus\n, Women are leading a volunteer effort to care for elders and vulnerable people across the tribe’s vast, poorly served territory, \nNina Lakhani, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 13.47 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Apr 2020 16.23 EDT\n\n, In mid-March, shortly after the Navajo Nation declared a public health state of emergency, Ethel Branch went out to stock up on supplies for her elderly mother and nieces who live on the Native American reservation., Branch, who lives in Flagstaff, Arizona, spent all day going from store to store trying to find canned soups, soap and toilet paper. Many had sold out, while others were price gouging amid rising panic about the coronavirus pandemic., Branch started calling friends looking for ideas about how to ensure the tribe’s most vulnerable families got enough food, water and hygiene supplies without risking their lives by traveling long distances., It was not easy. The Navajo Nation is the second-biggest tribal group in the US, with 332,000 people, according to the last census. But unemployment on the reservation hovers around 50% and it is also a food desert with only 13 grocery stores for 180,000 people. One in three people do not have running water or electricity., “I’d been monitoring developments in Asia since January, and knew when it hit us, it would be really bad so we had to get prepared,” said Branch, 40, who served as the Nation’s attorney general between 2015 and 2019., With these harsh realities in mind, Branch and her friends created the Navajo &amp; Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund, and started a GoFundMe page., By Thursday, $267,000 had been donated and a small army of volunteers was coordinating a full-scale emergency response to distribute crucial supplies to needy families across the vast Navajo territory and the neighboring Hopi reservation, where three small convenience stores serve almost 3,000 people., So far, more than 2,000 households have registered for help – some online but most by calling a call center volunteer who asks them about how much food they have left, allergies and medical needs, in order to prioritize orders., Hundreds of care packages – containing core items such as flour, beans, rice, canned soups, dried meat, fever and cough medicine, as well as fresh vegetables, fruit and meat when available, have been delivered to elders caring for grandchildren and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Fifty went to Chilchinbeto, a close-knit community of 500 people which has been locked down since the first localized spread was detected., The volunteer effort is an example of what the Navajo call T’áá hwó ajít’éego, or self-reliance and self-determination., “There’s no fixed model, we do what needs to be done, to get supplies where they are needed as fast and safely as possible through our network,” Branch told the Guardian., The volunteer – and government – efforts are a mammoth task given the size and geography of the Nation which stretches 27,000 square miles over the south-western Colorado plateau across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The territory, which is roughly the size of West Virginia, includes arid deserts and alpine forests with high plateaus, mesas and mountains reaching over 10,000ft in altitude., In addition to economic and topographic challenges, the coronavirus pandemic represents particular risks to the Navajo – and other tribal nations – as rates of cancer, heart and respiratory diseases and diabetes are comparatively higher than in the non-Native populations, while tribal health services have been underfunded for decades., Amid growing concern, the Navajo government issued a shelter-in-place order on 21 March – two days after California – shutting down all non-essential government services and businesses., “The order is to make sure we flatten the curve as soon as possible, and that means getting supplies to our most vulnerable residents and shelters so people stay home, and stay safe,” said tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty. “Water is now our number one priority.”, Even before this crisis, access to water on the Navajo reservation was incredibly complicated. At least 30% must rely on unregulated wells and springs – which can be unsafe as many groundwater sources are contaminated by some 523 abandoned uranium mines – or travel up to 40 miles to replenish tanks and buy bottled water to meet basic needs like drinking, cooking and bathing., The limited access to clean, running water made following coronavirus prevention guidelines such as frequent hand-washing challenging. Now, many government water distribution points have closed, while others have cut their hours to comply with the stay-at-home order., Finding a reliable bulk water supplier is a priority for Branch’s group as local stores and distributors expect shortages over coming weeks., The Navajo women driving this grassroots relief effort bring a range of business, public service and organizing experience, and include the owner of a home care company, a director of a not-for-profit small business incubator, and head of the department of corrections., These skills and contacts enabled them to make deals with wholesalers, and set up distribution points where volunteers sanitize items before trucking them to households in far-flung communities like Tuba City, Black Mesa and Hopi. The baskets are left on the doorstep, to minimize unnecessary physical contact., So far, 214 Covid-19 cases including seven deaths had been confirmed on the Nation., “It warms the heart,” said longstanding tribal council delegate Daniel Tso. “It brings tears to my eyes to see people organizing and risking their own health to protect the elderly and vulnerable children, it really shows the strength of the Navajo people.”navajo nation grassroots self help coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-583": {"text": "\nBeware hungry seagulls during lockdown, Yorkshire residents told\n, East Riding of Yorkshire council says coastal birds could be more aggressive due to lack of food, \nCaroline Davies, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 08.10 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Apr 2020 14.40 EDT\n\n, They are already the scourge of the seaside day tripper, mounting mobbing raids on those enjoying fish and chips., Now, with the coronavirus lockdown and all but essential travel banned, coastal residents are being warned seagulls could be more aggressive than usual because of a drop in their preferred food source., East Riding of Yorkshire council has told residents: “Due to a lack of food sources, seagulls may be more hungry than normal and may behave aggressively., “Residents are asked not to eat on the seafront areas, to encourage the birds to fend for themselves away from towns.”, People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:, Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:, Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed., Scavenging herring gulls are a regular feature in the council’s main resorts of Bridlington, Hornsea and Withernsea. “Particularly Bridlington because it’s a harbour, and an attractive and popular feature,” said a council spokesman. “Even on a normal weekend, in normal times, you would expect to be fending off gulls if you’re sitting there, having your fish and chips next to the harbour. So, that is a notorious spot for gulls anyway.”, Though as yet there has been no evidence of an increase in attacks, the spokesman added: “We are quite concerned that it may become a problem, with birds dive-bombing and chips being taken from your hand.” , The council is warning visitors to stay away. “Our message is please don’t go to the coast this weekend. Local residents can do their daily exercise on the seafront, he added, but if they do, don’t have fish and chips in your hand., “Herring gulls are creatures of habit and they pass their local knowledge on to their young. So, if we can adopt this behaviour now, and have a generation of young gulls who haven’t relied on human food, then theoretically it could be possible to break the cycle, and in future people would be more able to eat on the seafront without being mugged. That is a positive to come out of this.”, Peter Rock, an expert on urban gulls and a research associate at the University of Bristol, said the gulls would still find food. “They are very, very resourceful., “The large gulls know everything there is to know about everything within their home range. It behoves the sensible gull to know where to get food, exactly when, and how; where dustbins are being emptied into dustcarts, when black plastic bin bags are going out on to the street,” he said., “I don’t think we are going to see too much in the way of increased aggression to the one person walking around with a pasty in his hand in Cornwall. They are not all going to pile in and attack this one person. Because apart from staying alive, the most important thing a gull can do in its life is breed. If it gets involved in some kind of scrap, the possibility is it might get damaged. And that’s almost certainly the end of this year’s breeding career, and very likely the end of its life.

We must use this time well.”, Current commitments under the Paris agreement are insufficient to meet its aims of holding the world to no more than 2C – and preferably no more than 1.5C – of heating, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. The UK, as host of the Cop26 talks, is still aiming for all countries to come forward with fresh targets on their greenhouse gas emissions., The EU pledged it would sustain its push for a bloc-wide “green deal” that would involve stiffer cuts in emissions and a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said: “We will not slow down our work domestically or internationally to prepare for an ambitious Cop26.”, A clear benefit of moving the talks is that their original start date of 9 November was days after the US presidential election. That timing posed problems for negotiators, because Donald Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris accord, a decision that will take legal effect on 4 November., Some observers are hoping that a new president could change the course of the world’s most powerful economy and second biggest emitter. “American voters are increasingly likely to reject Trump’s science denial on both coronavirus and climate change and instead elect Joe Biden president,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. “Delaying Cop26 until 2021 means that Biden might have the chance to re-establish US climate leadership.”, Whether or not there is a change of administration, the delay has an advantage for countries negotiating with the US, said Nathaniel Keohane, a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund in the US., “Under the original schedule, the Cop was going to be overshadowed by the US elections regardless of the outcome,” explained Keohane. “The shift in schedule will allow countries to react and respond. If a Democrat wins in November, then by the time of the Cop, the US will have re-entered Paris and will be able to send a high-level political delegation, giving an important and positive boost to the talks. And if Trump is re-elected, other countries will have had time to absorb that information by the time of the Cop and know definitively that they have to move on without the US.”, This will be the first year in nearly three decades of annual climate negotiations under the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that no talks are held., However, given the scale of the coronavirus crisis, by the end of a nearly four-hour meeting on Wednesday it was clear a decision had to be made quickly. Questions were raised over the potential problems with a postponement, in delaying vital work by countries on their emissions plans, but none of the parties objected to the final decision., It may take months for a new date for Cop26 to be decided, with hopes that it could take place in early spring at the soonest. The UK is still committed to holding the summit in Glasgow, and is working with the Scottish government on logistics, and with its scientific advisers on when might be safe to hold a summit in which it is hoped civil society and activists will play a key role., For now, the immediate goal of green campaigners is to ensure that recovery plans from the coronavirus crisis do not entrench investment in high emissions. There is a danger that some countries are using the pandemic to roll back environmental protections and commitments – in the US, for instance, the Trump administration has revoked clean car standards and in the EU, carmakers have lobbied for a watering down of their emissions obligations., “Cop26 being put on hold should make governments double down on their efforts to ensure a green and just way forward in handling this health crisis and the climate emergency,” said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International. “Going back to business as usual is completely unacceptable: this pandemic shows there are huge lessons to be learned about the importance of listening to science and the need for urgent collective global action.”we must use this time well climate experts hopeful after cop26 delay coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-585": {"text": "\n'A perfect storm': US facing hunger crisis as demand for food banks soars\n, \n'A perfect storm': US facing hunger crisis as demand for food banks soars\n, Food banks are reporting unprecedented demand across the US as millions lose jobs, investigation shows, \nNina Lakhani in New York, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 05.10 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Apr 2020 07.21 EDT\n\n, An unprecedented number of Americans have resorted to food banks for emergency supplies since the coronavirus pandemic triggered widespread layoffs., The demand for food aid has increased as much as eightfold in some areas, according to an investigation by the Guardian, which gives a nationwide snapshot of the hunger crisis facing the US as millions become unemployed., Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs. , As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help., The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families., If you want to help, find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund., Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use Feeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice., Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America., About one in three people seeking groceries at not-for-profit pantries last month have never previously needed emergency food aid, according to interviews with a dozen providers across the country., The national guard has been deployed to help food banks cope with rising demand in cities including Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Phoenix amid growing concerns that supplies may run low as the crisis evolves. Overstretched food pantries are switching to drive-thrus and home deliveries to minimize the spread of Covid-19 as almost 300 million Americans are urged to stay at home., “I’ve been in this business over 30 years, and nothing compares to what we’re seeing now. Not even when the steel mills closed down did we see increased demand like this,” said Sheila Christopher, director of Hunger-Free Pennsylvania, which represents 18 food banks across 67 counties., Last year, 4.3bn meals were distributed to more than 40 million Americans through a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries, schools, soup kitchens and shelters, according to Feeding America, the national food bank network. The working poor, elderly and disabled and infirm accounted for the vast majority of food bank users., This week, the Guardian contacted food banks and pantries in nine states, which all reported unprecedented demand, plummeting donations from retailers, and a fall in personnel due to the coronavirus crisis., In Amherst, home to the University of Massachusetts’ largest campus, the pantry distributed 849% more food in March compared with the previous year. The second-largest increase in western Massachusetts was 748% at the Pittsfield Salvation Army pantry., The Grace Klein community food pantry in Jefferson county, which has the largest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Alabama, provided 5,076 individuals with food boxes last week – a 90% increase on the previous week., In southern Arizona, demand has doubled, with pantries supplying groceries to 4,000 households every day – double the number supplied in March 2019. “We saw an increase during the federal government shutdown but nothing as rapid, massive or overwhelming as this,” said Michael McDonald, CEO of the Community Food Bank of South Arizona., A helpline set up by the Greater Pittsburgh community food bank has received more than a thousand calls in the past two weeks, 90% of which came from newly unemployed people. Here, pantries ordered 50% to 60% more food for March and April than usual., The Lakeview pantry in Chicago is on track to provide food for as many as 2,000 individuals this week – compared with 1,100 before the coronavirus crisis., The north Florida food bank, which relied heavily on contributions from retailers, has seen donations drop by 85% to 90% as shoppers bulk-buy, leaving shelves empty. But donations from restaurants, golf tournaments and even Disney World have increased, so the food bank is switching to ready meals, paying furloughed chefs to cook for thousands of senior citizens in housing facilities., In Las Vegas, the Three Square food bank has increased weekly food distribution by 30%, from 1m to 1.3m lbs of food. New drive-thru distribution centres have been set up across the valley as 170 of its 180 distribution outlets have been forced to temporarily close due to CDC social distancing guidelines. “Every line at every distribution centre exceeds the amount of food in our trucks,” said chief operating officer Larry Scott., The Kansas City-based Harvesters food bank, which serves 16 counties in north-east Kansas and 10 in north-west Missouri, sent out 12,000 boxes to pantries on Monday 23 March – a 140% rise on the 5,000 boxes typically ordered. “It was the largest distribution day in our 40-year history,” said its communications manager, Gene Hallinan., This snapshot is representative of the national picture, according to Feeding America. “This is a perfect storm impacting food banking as we know it,” said a spokeswoman, Zuani Villarreal., On Tuesday, Cleveland police and the Ohio national guard helped load boxes of groceries into cars at a new drive-thru pick-up service located in the huge downtown municipal car park., At least 2,765 families were provided with a week’s groceries – 36% of them first-timers – compared with 1,500 at a similar event last week, when the queue stretched almost three miles. A cab driver, single mother who worked in hospitality and freelance photographer were among those requesting help for the first time., The rust belt states are among the hardest hit by the coronavirus economic crisis. More than 187,000 Ohioans filed for unemployment benefits during the third week of March when businesses were closed by the governor – an extraordinary increase on the 7,046 claims filed the previous week, according to the Department of Labor., The Greater Cleveland food bank received 800 calls to its helpline during one day last week – eight times the usual number. “I’ve never seen anything like it in over 20 years of service. We’re seeing people from every socio-economic level because the majority of Americans live paycheck to paycheck,” said the food bank’s CEO, Kristin Warzocha., Half of American adults have either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate’s 2019 Financial Security Index., There was a similar dramatic scene in Phoenix, Arizona, where 1,500 people queued up for food boxes at the St Mary’s main office – compared with 450 just two weeks ago. Here, the national guard is also pitching in at the makeshift drive-thru centre as volunteer numbers have plummeted from 250 a day to less than 50, as the vast majority are senior citizens advised to stay home to minimize the risk of Covid-19., In total, St Mary’s – the oldest known food bank in the world – supplies 700 pantries, shelters, churches and social service centres in seven counties where one in five children struggle with hunger., “First we saw people who lived paycheck to paycheck, got laid off and didn’t know where the next meal was coming from, followed by those who had a couple of weeks of savings. Now, people who knew about us because they donated or volunteered are coming in for food,” said Jerry Brown, media spokesman for St Mary’s. “The 2008 recession doesn’t touch this. It’s a different ballgame.”, Before the coronavirus pandemic, about 37 million, or one in eight, Americans could not always access enough nutritional food to lead healthy, active lives. Food insecurity forces families to make tradeoffs between basic needs such as housing, medical bills and food, and many do not qualify for federal nutrition programs., The government rescue packages include some measures to help alleviate food insecurity such as expanding eligibility for food stamps, increasing commodities donations from the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and providing $1,200 to every American earning under $99,000., But experts warn that help has been slow, patchy and inadequate so far., “Philanthropy and not-for-profits are not going to be able to meet food demands. The government needs to step in,” said Kellie O’Connell, chief executive of the Lakeview pantry in Chicago., Caitlin Welsh, director of global food security at the Washington based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: “The supply chain is strong but as the number of food insecure people increases continuously, we’ll perhaps need a new wave of federal legislation directed specifically at household food security., “These numbers show that the pandemic is causing economic shocks never experienced in our lifetime.”us food banks coronavirus demand unemployment", "label": 0}, "train-586": {"text": "\nSecret footage shows calves from Ireland beaten and kicked in France\n, Video by activists appears to show cruel treatment of weeks-old cattle transported on long journeys to Europe for veal, Sophie Kevany, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 03.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Apr 2020 21.06 EDT\n\n, Footage which appears to show Irish calves being beaten and kicked at a French feeding station has been published by animal campaign groups., The video, published by Eyes on Animals (EoA) and French welfare organisation L214, appears to show workers repeatedly beating calves that are a few weeks old with sticks. One is kicked and another is dragged away, unable to stand. The calf was euthanised by a vet, said an EoA observer., Ireland’s dairy sector, which earned the country €4.4bn (£3.9bn) in export revenues last year, relies heavily on veal farms in mainland Europe to buy unwanted male dairy calves. Dairy cows must produce calves in order to continue producing milk, but male calves are no use to the industry: they are known as “shipping-calves” in the Irish agricultural press., The latest figures from Ireland’s national agricultural body, Teagasc, show there are just over 1.4 million dairy cows in Ireland this year, each of which will calve once, producing approximately 700,000 male calves. Figures from the agriculture ministry show almost 247,000 cattle were exported from the country in 2018., Last month animal welfare campaigners followed calf trucks from the Irish port of Rosslare to the French port of Cherbourg. They documented a number of welfare and transport infractions., EU law obliges calf transporters to feed and rest calves after nine hours of travel, “‘if necessary”. After a second nine-hour journey, or a total of 18 hours’ transport, calves must be fed and rested for 12 hours. , But Lesley Moffat of EoA said that from what her team had witnessed, “including the time it takes to move calves to and from ports, plus a boat journey of about 18 hours, the calves had been on the road for an estimated 23 hours without milk or milk replacer, well above the legal maximum of 18 hours.”, Campaigners described the handling of calves on arrival at Couville, France, as brutal. “The four Irish trucks would be carrying about 1,200 calves and when they arrive, they’re desperate for milk. The workers get impatient because they won’t leave the feeders. Calves were kicked and whacked repeatedly, particularly around the head with sticks. We saw one collapse, either because of the brutality or because of exhaustion and hunger. Or both.”, A year ago the two groups covered calf mistreatment at another Cherbourg feeding facility, Qualivia. Moffat said the incidents could not be dismissed as isolated. , The groups also argued that the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted dairy industry weaknesses. “The continuing export of Irish dairy calves is a welfare nightmare. It breaks a range of EU laws and increases the risk of infections and diseases being transferred from one country to another. There is no automatic quarantine for truckers. On this trip the drivers moved from Rosslare to France through Belgium, up to Holland, and then they go home,” said Moffat., In a statement, L214 described the transport of calves as “an ordeal” in normal times, and, during the Covid-19 pandemic, “totally irresponsible”. They called on the EU and the French agriculture ministry to “urgently stop” veal transports., A lawyer for another welfare organisation, currently preparing a court case that could end unweaned calf exports from Scotland and possibly the rest of the EU, agreed about the welfare and disease risks., “This is why we’re asking the Scottish courts to declare it unlawful to allow unweaned calves to be exported.

He said the UK government and Boris Johnson, had “both said they want to end live exports”, making their defence “hypocritical”., Contacted by the Guardian, the director of the feeding facility where the calf mistreatment was filmed, said the mistreatment allegedly shown in the video was “not possible” but refused to comment further.

Last week, as winds turned easterly, particle pollution once again spread across western Europe. Spring smogs can cause particle pollution to reach the top value of 10 in the UK air quality index, but four to nine is more typical., With the lockdown in place, the increases were less than normal. The air quality index peaked at three over most of England and Wales. A few places in south-east England, Yorkshire and north Wales reached four, the level where health advisory messages are issued. After three days, a welcome change of wind direction at the weekend pushed the polluted air southwards., In March 2014, Paris and many other French cities banned half their cars to control a spring smog. Most of the UK was also affected, but actions here are limited to advising elderly and vulnerable people to refrain from outdoor exercise. A second smog struck that April and the then prime minister David Cameron was heavily criticised by opposition MPs and European officials when he tweeted that the bad air quality in London was harmless Saharan dust., It was not. Later, Public Health England estimated these two smogs led to around 600 early deaths in England and Wales. Spikes were also seen in people arriving at hospital emergency departments in London and Paris, especially in young people with asthma., Like Paris, many cities across Europe restrict traffic, reduce speed limits and subsidise public transport during severe smogs. These types of actions have been found to reduce air pollution by around 15%-20% in areas with a lot of traffic. However, during spring smogs, polluted air spreads from country to country, so it is hard for any city to completely control these episodes on its own., Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days., If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home., After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start. Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days., If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days., If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible., After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine., If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal., If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone., Staying at home means you should:, You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people., If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do., Source: NHS England on 23 March 2020, Globally, Beijing has been the venue for the most successful smog control schemes. These were devised for the 2008 Olympics, but have since been used for other high-profile events. Industry around Beijing was curtailed and traffic cut by half for the Asia Pacific Economic Conference in 2014, and the 2015 parade to mark 70 years since the end of the second world war., Suddenly, the people of Beijing could see the true colour of the sky without the customary haze. It was nicknamed “APEC blue” and later “parade blue”. These controls took place over an area of around 500,000 km2, covering a population of nearly 300 million people., I have often wondered what would happen if we did the same in Europe, but I thought I would never find out. In 2017 a team of French scientists used a computer model to predict what might happen if all of Europe shut down for a day to control a springtime smog. Particle pollution would fall by about 20%-40% in major cities. Last week we saw Beijing-scale measures implemented across Europe for the first time., But with countries in lockdown, why was air pollution still as high as three or four? Measurements from King’s College London provide the answer. Chemical analysis of the pollution particles showed traffic sources along with gas combustion for power generation by industry and for home heating, as you might expect. Wood burning in London’s homes added to the mixture., Many particles also included ammonia in their make-up. This comes from agriculture; crops are being planted and fertilised, and manure is being spread on fields over the UK and Europe. It is these agricultural emissions that make spring our most polluted season., A study of the Sars epidemic in China suggested that infected people were more likely to die if their area had poor-quality air. In Dublin the in 1980s, it was a deterioration of survival rates inside hospitals that prompted the city to ban the most polluting types of coal. It is too early to tell whether avoiding this smog will have helped those people suffering from the Covid-19 virus. One big lesson is that air pollution control comes from many sources, and farmers and those with wood fires will need to be part of the fight for clean air.lockdown eases seasonal smog pollution", "label": 0}, "train-588": {"text": "\n'Thank you Greta': natural solutions to UK flooding climb the agenda\n, \n'Thank you Greta': natural solutions to UK flooding climb the agenda\n, People are increasingly looking to restore the soil’s ability to retain water, planting trees and hedges, and creating relief channels to tackle the recurring threat of high waters, \nPhoebe Weston, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 02.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Apr 2020 09.26 EDT\n\n, There is ponding on nearly every field in the valley where the rivers Severn and Vyrnwy meet on the English-Welsh border. Swollen rivers have been sluggishly sitting in the valley for months. Inhabitants’ attempts to protect their homes from flooding are part of a losing battle played out across the country., The UK’s flooding this year is a story of desperation – but also hope, says John Hughes, development manager at Shropshire Wildlife Trust, who works in the valley. Following widespread acceptance of the climate and ecological emergency, Hughes believes people are increasingly looking to nature for solutions., George Eustice, the environment secretary, has announced that £4bn will be spent on flood defences in the next five years and said a “big part of our focus is going to be nature-based solutions upstream”., Hughes says: “The media normally have a distinct agenda when it comes to floods which is: ‘how miserable have you been?’ This time around the interviews I heard were talking about natural solutions and I’d never heard that before., “I say thanks very much Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg – you’ve done a great job. It’s the job we’ve been trying to do for 50 years. We need to take a holistic view – land can do many, many things.”, In the past, flood plains acted like sponges that soaked up water and stopped it flowing headlong into settlements downstream. Wetter habitats provided useful materials such as willow and reeds for baskets and thatched roofs. However, natural wet woodland, neutral grassland, fens and marshes were ironed out of the postwar landscape and now cover just 11% of English and Welsh flood plains. Intensive agriculture covers 70%., Crops such as maize, potatoes, asparagus and onions are harvested as late as October because of the milder UK climate. This means fields are often left bare over winter months after heavy machinery has compacted the soil. This leaves the land unable to soak up so much water., “When you drive heavy vehicles on soggy soil you make a mess,” says John Quinton, professor of soil science at Lancaster University. “You’ve then destroyed the soil structure, and because of that water can’t get into the soil very quickly. The water runs over the surface of the soil and picks up the soil and deposits it in rivers or elsewhere. If soils are in good condition, the water will go into the soil and you will have a lot of storage.”, Scientists say creating grassland, giving land rest periods and avoiding the use of heavy machinery in flood-prone areas will reduce nutrient and sediment loss from fields. “Some groups of farmers are definitely moving in the right direction. When I started my career in the late 80s we weren’t talking about soil erosion or nutrient losses. Things are changing,” says Quinton., We need to take a holistic view – land can do many, many things, Experts are only beginning to understand the complexity of soil ecosystems. In the flood-hit village of Eaton Bishop in Herefordshire, farm conservation adviser Caroline Hanks compares two spadefuls of soil from the same field near her house – one from the middle of the field where intensively farmed maize was harvested in October, and the other from under tussocky grass by the hedge. The first sample is root-free and heavily compacted, meaning water cannot percolate more than eight inches below the surface. The second spadeful is crumbly, full of roots and moist throughout. The two samples look – and smell – different., “We’re trying to give people a visual way to assess their soil. It’s such a simple technique – you can tell so much from a spadeful of soil,” says Hanks, who specialises in advising farmers on creating flower-rich grassland. “Twenty years ago people expected us to focus on birds and hedgerows and field edges but these days getting a spade out and looking at soil is a core part of the visit.”, According to Quinton’s Defra-funded research there is between three and 10 times more water run-off from compacted soils than healthy soils. “That rotten egg smell you get from compacted soils is certainly something that says to me that’s an unhealthy soil,” he says. “It shows that it’s compacted and its normal biology isn’t functioning very well. In the soil that’s aerated you’ve got fungi and bacteria which are active and sometimes after rain, you get that sweet smell of damp soil, and it’s actually a compound called geosmin.”, Many natural flood-management techniques involve reinstating features that were once common to fields such as ponds, hedges and leaky dams (either created by fallen trees or beavers). Creating buffer strips, wooded areas, drainage ditches and re-meandering rivers are all part of the toolkit. The overall effect is to give the landscape more structure and roughness to counterbalance the way industrialised farming has smoothed it out., The problem is that reducing food production is currently counterintuitive to most farmers’ business plan, says Dr Marc Stutter, a soil and water scientist at the James Hutton Institute. “The biggest thing we’re fighting against is that the farmers and their fathers and grandfathers have been very proud of the way they’ve brought the land into condition for crops and quite rightfully so. Their parents have spent a lot of effort draining the land and now there’s someone telling them they want pockets of it to be wet up again., “If we could reverse it and say they’re not just farmers of a crop but stewards of the land then we might be able to think of water quality and flood resistance as part of their overall job.”, Natural flood management has other benefits – planting trees and hedges helps to create vital habitats for nature and locks away carbon. Creating buffer strips along streams and rivers helps filter out pollutants and improves water quality., However, nature-based solutions are no silver bullet, according to analysis by the University of Oxford which found they would be overwhelmed by the sort of floods seen in the UK this winter., Not one size fits all. It must be an open discussion, Making the land more absorbent should be used alongside traditional “hard engineering” techniques such as flood walls, says Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading., “Putting beavers in the River Thames is not going to keep people dry and a different solution is required. However, for some of the smaller communities you could implement woody debris dams and make sure the soil upstream is able to absorb the water. Not one size fits all. It must be an open discussion between farmers and Defra and the Environment Agency and scientists. It’s not an easy problem but I think we should be confident that we can solve it,” she says., In 2015 Glenridding, a village at the bottom of Helvellyn in the Lake District, was one of many communities trashed by Storm Desmond., Danny Teasdale, a mechanic from the village, decided to do something. “Flooding isn’t going to go away, we’ve got to start looking at things. There are extreme conservationists on one side and extreme farmers on the other and they keep clashing heads and nothing happens. I sit in the middle … I know the local farmers and they trust me,” he says., In the valley above the village, Teasdale created a wiggly upstream release channel that runs parallel to the river and fills up only when the river is full. He worked with the local farmer and the Environment Agency. The £6,000 project was funded by a local flood action group., Teasdale says: “We’ve just had really, really heavy rain with Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis – I think some of the heaviest since Storm Desmond – and it didn’t flood this time. So it’s looking like it’s been helping. It goes hand in hand with hard engineering in the village but if you can slow things down upstream you don’t need to build your walls so high.”, Teasdale’s work was so successful he created a community interest group called Ullswater Catchment Management CIC in November 2018. He has since worked in a number of different catchments around Ullswater with the Woodland Trust, Natural England and the Environment Agency, including planting 2,000 trees in Grisedale valley at a cost of £8,000 and a project to re-wiggle the river in Matterdale that cost £14,000., “It’s peanuts compared to the money that goes into hard engineering,” explains Teasdale, who says £2m has already been spent on hard flood defences in Glenridding., Elsewhere in the Lake District, the RSPB led a similar river re-wiggling scheme in Swindale valley. The work cost £200,000 and involved letting the river meander back into its old course after being straightened by hill farmers looking to dry out land hundreds of years ago. The valley is a kilometre long and the river is now 180 metres longer., “It’s all about holding that water in the higher catchments for longer,” says Lee Schofield, a site manager at RSPB Haweswater. “Having a wiggly river means they move more slowly. We’re delaying flood peak – it’s a low-tech solution that delivers many other benefits and makes the landscape much more resilient.”, Wiggly rivers move more slowly. We’re delaying flood peak, Paul Quinn, a senior lecturer in catchment hydrology at Newcastle University, believes more drastic landscape measures, called catchment systems engineering (CSE), are needed to compensate for the fact that flood plains are already full of houses and roads. More than 40% of rivers have been deepened or modified so that they are no longer connected to their flood plains., “In a beautiful world that doesn’t exist, we could get our soil back into good condition and that would actually stop a lot of floods. But when the big floods come along – the kind that climate change is going to produce – soil management is not going to do it,” he says., “CSE is halfway between nature-based solutions and something that’s a bit like traditional flood management which is usually big dams, big ponds and big walls. We need to start spreading them out over the whole catchment system. It seems to me such a simple idea. It’s not rocket science, it’s about storing water – and large amounts of it – at every opportunity you can.”, Quinn’s approach includes natural solutions as well as features such as the creation of large retention ponds and cascading channels. His team built 35 ponds and dams, and created 10 zones of oak, beech and willow plantations in the catchment attached to the village of Belford in Northumberland which has been badly affected by flooding. The scheme cost £200,000 and in the seven years since the work was completed the village has not flooded. “Every single catchment in the country will have to be done,” he says., In terms of soils, Quinton believes people’s attitudes are already changing: “I sense a shift in the farming community with a much greater emphasis on soils and how to sustain them. I have no evidence for this, except talking to farmers and watching Twitter. I get the feeling that there is increasing recognition that protecting soils is vital for the sustainability of the farm business.”, Farmers think of food production as their primary motivation because that is what they have been subsidised to do. Rather than trying to farm flood-prone areas of land that don’t yield much, farmers may be subsidised to manage them for nature. Many feel the government is making the right noises with policies laid out in the new Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) – which will be fully implemented by 2028., A Defra spokesperson told the Guardian that natural flood management would be an important part of protecting the nation from flooding. “ELMS will reward farmers for the public goods that they provide, including protecting communities from environmental hazards such as flooding. Natural England and the Environment Agency do vital work and we continue to work closely with both agencies to ensure they have the right resources to continue to do so.”, Soil management has featured prominently in ELMS – with funding set to be available for measures such as no-till agriculture and maintaining water in peat soils – but conservationists are worried that the devil is in the detail., Teasdale says: “I’ve seen what the government has done to Environment Agency and Natural England and what they’ve done to their budget, and it’s criminal. They’ve slashed it. ELMS could potentially be good but it needs to be funded properly and that’s what I’m not sure about.

Starlings were the second most sighted, followed by the blue tit., Daniel Hayhow, an RSPB conservation scientist, said: “Small birds suffer during long, cold winters but the warmer January weather this year appears to have given species such as the wren and long-tailed tit a boost.

Believed to be the last wild daffodil wood in Northumberland, it is owned and managed by the Woodland Trust. The Letah Burn cuts a meandering course down its length with a footpath criss-crossing it by stony fords., There are remnants of coppicing and a honeysuckle vine winds round a hazel pole like a helter-skelter at a fair. As the vine grows and tightens it will mould and shape the hazel, something that walking-stick makers would patiently encourage for the natural barley sugar twists. Hazel, holly and yew are the understorey trees beneath soaring beeches and magnificent Douglas firs., The entire hillside on the opposite side of the burn is fresh and green with wild garlic. Sunlight slants through the beeches, throwing striped shadows across its succulent leaves. They can be used to make a vibrant pesto with walnuts, an emerald spring soup, a pungent potato curry. In a few weeks’ time, the garlic’s starry flowers will transform it into a hill of white. This plant is a survivor. A clump of wild garlic is growing between the buttresses of a beech tree, making use of the little cavity that is damp and rich with leaf mould., There’s evidence of the winter’s high winds and relentless rain. I teeter on the rocks and branches that other walkers have laid across boggy, squelching mud. The burn twists and turns through scoured banks where exposed tree roots hang like a horse’s mane. A small holly, torn from the earth, arcs across the stream, and I have to scramble under a huge beech that was felled in the gales., Then, on the bank in front of me, I see the wild daffodils. Straw-pale petals around deeper yellow trumpets and with softly glaucous leaves, they are smaller and daintier than garden varieties. In isolated clusters or spilling down the slope in large drifts, they are delicate and exuberant at the same time. The joy I feel at seeing them is heightened by the sudden yaffle of a green woodpecker echoing through the wood., • Susie White recorded a walk in Letah Wood for BBC Radio 4’s PM programme on 23 March 2020country diary my heart dances with the daffodils", "label": 0}, "train-591": {"text": "\nAustralia’s path to net-zero emissions lies in rapid, stimulus-friendly steps\n, The opportunity to meet the target by 2035 is within our grasp – thanks to much cheaper technology – but we must be ready, \nAdam Morton Environment editor, \n\nFri 3 Apr 2020 17.54 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Apr 2020 18.44 EDT\n\n, Nearly two years ago, ClimateWorks Australia set out to test whether the implied goal agreed by world leaders at the Paris climate conference – cutting greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050 – was still possible in Australia. They weren’t certain it would be. They were pleasantly surprised by the result., “We found not only is it not yet out of reach in Australia, but it can be achieved using technologies that are mostly already mature and available,” says Anna Skarbek, the chief executive of the not-for-profit that was established in 2009 to fill a gap between climate research and action., Net-zero emissions targets have been adopted by 121 countries responsible for a quarter of CO2, asset owners worth $4tn and an expanding list of major companies. The Morrison government is yet to join them, having promised a long-term strategy later this year, but all Australia’s states and territories have net-zero goals for mid-century., ClimateWorks spent 18 months examining each part of the Australian economy in detail to consider what would be involved in getting there. The resulting report, Decarbonisation Futures, is an update of similar work in 2014. It found net-zero emissions were possible not just by mid-century but by 2035 – soon enough for Australia to play its part in an effort to limit global heating to 1.5C., The report lands as the coronavirus crisis has, in a best-case scenario, postponed 2020’s expected focus on climate change. The year-end UN meeting in Glasgow has been delayed until next year. It is considered the most important since Paris in 2015, with countries being exhorted to ramp up commitments as promised in the French capital. , ClimateWorks’ analysis was completed before the pandemic hit, but Skarbek says the need to recover from the economic shock once the survival stage passes will also provide an opportunity to make the sort of investment required to respond to the climate crisis., It’s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done. That’s why it is stimulus-friendly, The former will demand a substantial stimulus program. The latter requires an “all-in” approach from governments, business and individuals in what the report calls “the transformational decade” before 2030. After that, the window for Australia to do its bit towards the Paris targets and prepare for a coming global zero emissions economy may have closed., Skarbek says it means a “make or break moment” is coming. The good news, she says, is many transformational climate-friendly steps are stimulus-ready., “If we get this right, we can meet Australia’s international climate change commitments, create jobs in sustainable industries, and set ourselves up for a smoother and speedier shift to a zero-emissions economy,” she says., “If we miss the moment of the stimulus injection to also accelerate on climate, the downturn will make it even harder to do what is needed over the next decade. I do worry we might miss this chance forever if we don’t seize it now.”, The report finds the progress and fall in cost of clean technology since the last analysis six years ago has been faster than expected, with renewable energy becoming cheaper than fossil fuels and the cost of batteries plunging 80% in a decade. It says much of the shift needed now could be rolled out quickly by rapid and large-scale deployment of familiar technology., It would include upgrading homes and commercial buildings to boost energy efficiency and run on solar power; building more large-scale clean energy plants and storage; installing electric vehicle charging stations; boosting the use of recycled goods in supply chains; and supporting more carbon forestry by planting and protecting trees to store CO2., “It’s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done,” Skarbek says. “That’s why it is stimulus-friendly.”, The analysis found the difference between making cuts consistent with 1.5C and 2C of heating were noteworthy, but not always that great. The lower goal was likely to mean renewable energy providing 79% of power by 2030, compared with 73% for 2C and 48% if we continue on the current path without governments introducing further policies., On electric vehicles, a 1.5C path could require three out of every four new cars sold in 2030 being electric, compared with one out of two on a 2C path. The government has projected EVs will make up one in five new sales by then., Deployment of available tech to make rapid cuts in electricity, buildings and transport is easier than in heavy industry, agriculture and the land, but Amandine Denis-Ryan, ClimateWorks’ head of national programs, says there are emerging solutions in those areas., One may be hydrogen, which governments are backing as a potentially plentiful clean energy source for use in transport and industry, and to export. While the report acknowledges green hydrogen is likely to have a part to play, it does not assume how big that role will be, given it is a relatively new industry and there is little data to back it up., But Skarbek says it is a potential answer to two big questions: what can be done in those parts of the economy, particularly in heavy industry, that cannot easily shift to running on clean electricity? And what industries can fill the gap created by Australia’s reliance on fossil fuel exports?, Denis-Ryan stresses the report reveals both what is possible and the urgency of the task. Achieving the Paris goals will require national emissions being cut in half by 2030 at the latest., “We now know we have enough technological capacity in the Australian economy to get there,” she says. “But we need to get these technologies out the door at every opportunity.”, The analysis found electricity is key – getting to 100% clean energy will help clean up other parts of the economy. It suggests no significant increase in storage is needed to get from where we are today, at about 25% clean energy, to 50%. Pumped hydro and batteries are mature and available technologies for when that boost is required., Hydrogen may play a role, and demand-response programs, microgrids and inertia control technology are all considered at demonstration stage and could be rapidly scaled up to improve grid security. But the key factor determining the pace of the electricity transition is the speed at which coal and gas plants are closed., The analysis suggests over-building renewable energy to 200% capacity – double what the country needs – could be more cost-effective than building to 100%, and would spark new clean export opportunities., As with electricity, the technology for zero-emissions building already exists., It would involve improving energy efficiency through insulation and draught sealing and by installing LED lighting, solar hot water and efficient heating, cooling and appliances. It could mean the introduction of passive house design standards to conserve energy, the use of electrochromic windows that allow owners to control the amount of light and heat that passes through them, and smart systems that optimise when and how power is used. But much of it would be driven by a shift to clean energy, replacing gas-fired heating and cooking with heat pumps and induction stovetops., Transport is not as easy to tackle as electricity and buildings, but the analysis found it could reach near zero emissions by 2050 through improving travel practices (using more electrified mass public transport and video-conferencing for business), shifting to electric vehicles and replacing fossil fuels with biofuels, and possibly renewable hydrogen and ammonia., Industrial emissions have been rising rapidly in Australia, effectively cancelling out reductions in electricity generation and drought-affected agriculture before the coronavirus pandemic. They are harder to cut and would leave considerable “residual” emissions by 2050 based on existing technology., Improved efficiency, fast-tracking a circular economy in which metals, plastics and timber are recycled and reused and 3D printing plays a bigger role, electrifying mines and steel operations where possible, and shifting to renewable fuels are (to varying degrees) available solutions that could lead to deep cuts., Immediate cuts are possible through better use of energy, including onsite renewables at farms, substituting some meat products for plants and better management of waste and fertiliser. Other changes such as using vaccines to limit methane from livestock, and shifting to lab-grown meat, are emerging technologies and need greater support for rapid rollout., Reaching net-zero emissions in the medium-term would involve expanding use of forests to store carbon to offset the sector where, based on today’s technology, the complete eradication of CO2 is not yet possible.

It will definitely impact the model of carbon flows,” said Oregon State University microbiologist Steve Giovannoni. “It will require more than just a small tweak.”, Researchers say the spring phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic is probably the largest annual biological carbon sequestration mechanism on the planet. Like a vast forest of tiny plants in the sunlight upper part of the ocean, they draw down carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The bigger the plankton, the higher the chance they will sink into the deep mesopelagic zone of the ocean, where carbon can be trapped for more than 1,000 years., Until now, climate models have assumed that diatoms – one of the biggest types of plankton – were dominant. But the study, published in the International Society for Microbial Ecology Journal, reveals they are a very minor share of biomass when compared with much smaller cyanobacteria, picophytoeukaryotes and nanophytoeukaryotes., This was expected in winter, but the research team found that even in spring – shortly before the annual bloom – there were far fewer diatoms in the western North Atlantic than assumed, “We asked, how could our impressions of this ocean region be so far off?” Giovannoni said. “There are three possibilities: new equipment that allows us to see smaller plankton more clearly, the fact that previous studies had focussed on more eastern regions, and climate change altering the biology of the ocean.”, Although the findings of this study of one part of the North Atlantic – much of it carried out in fierce gales – do not necessarily apply to all oceans, Giovannoni said they highlight how little is understood of marine biology, as well as the need for close-up study., Nasa and other satellite monitoring agencies have previously used images from space to assess the carbon draw-down capacity of algae blooms, but they will need to revise the assumptions on which their calculations are based., • The headline on this article was amended on 4 April 2020 to make clear that the story is about the North Atlantic, not all oceans as suggested in an earlier version.oceans capacity to absorb co2 overestimated study suggests", "label": 0}, "train-594": {"text": "Edible insects set to be approved by EU in 'breakthrough moment', Food safety agency’s decision could put mealworms, locusts and baby crickets on menus , It is being billed as the long-awaited breakthrough moment in European gastronomy for mealworm burgers, locust aperitifs and cricket granola., Within weeks the EU’s European Food Safety Authority is expected by the insect industry to endorse whole or ground mealworms, lesser mealworms, locusts, crickets and grasshoppers as being safe for human consumption., The ruling is likely to lead to the final authorisation of their sale across the EU as a “novel food” by as soon as the autumn, opening up opportunities for mass production of a range of insect dishes to be sold across Europe for the first time., “These have a good chance of being given the green light in the coming few weeks,” said Christophe Derrien, the secretary general of the industry organisation International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed., “We reckon these authorisations will be a breakthrough for the sector so we are looking for those authorisations quite impatiently. They are taking the necessary time, they are very demanding on information, which is not bad. But we believe that once we have the first novel food given a green light from EFSA that will have a snowball effect.”, In the eyes of leading players in the insects-as-food industry, the potential for their high-protein delicacies has been held back by a lack of EU-wide approval., The UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Finland have taken a permissive approach to a 1997 EU law that requires foods not eaten before that year to get novel food authorisation., Those national regulators decided the EU law did not pertain to animals used for food. As a result, a host of insect-based products can be found in British, Dutch, Belgian and Finnish supermarkets. About 500 tonnes of insect-based food for human consumption is produced every year., But such products are banned in France, Italy and Spain, among other countries. In 2018, a new EU law sought to bring some clarity. It stipulated that insect-based dishes would also require novel food authorisation., A transition period was established to allow companies already producing food from insects to operate until they received a judgment on the safety of the species they work with and final approval by the EU’s institutions., Indeed, companies such such as Protifarm in the Netherlands, Micronutris in France, Essento in Switzerland and Entogourmet in Spain are said to be preparing to ramp up their operations., “We have many of our members building bigger factories because the key to success is to upscale your companies and produce on a mass scale. And this is already happening,” Derrien said. “We are expecting the next few years will be very interesting ones and obviously the novel food authorisations will definitely help.”, He added: “The sort of foods ranges from whole insects as an aperitif or as snacks to processed insects in bars or pasta or burgers made out of insects. We believe that insects for food is one solution for some of the biggest challenges we are facing on the planet.

In some areas, they report an uptick in invasions by miners, driven partly by the rise in the price of gold since the start of the global crisis., This week, Brazil reported its first Covid-19 case in its indigenous population, but as the pandemic extends through the country, death threats and violence against indigenous peoples continue, most recently with the fifth killing of a Guajajara forest guardian in five months., Last year deforestation and fire hit their highest levels in more than a decade, following ultra-right president Jair Bolsonaro’s weakening of environmental protections, encouragement of loggers and miners, and criticism of indigenous communities and conservation organisations., The government’s main environmental protection agency, Ibama, has acknowledged that even fewer agents are going out into the field due to Covid-19 risks. After years of personnel cuts, a third of the staff are close to retirement age, which means they are considered more vulnerable to the disease. “There’s no way you can take these people who are at risk and expose them to the virus,” Olivaldi Azevedo, director of environmental protection, told Reuters., The official said the Amazon would not be affected, but activists in the state of Rondônia said they had already noticed a reduction in activity by Ibama and ICMBio (the state agency that maintains national parks) and a resurgent threat from land grabbers., The environmental group WWF and its local partner Kanindé say a major invasion is being planned in the coming days near the Alto Jamari village in the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau indigenous territory., The land grabbers aim to gather a large group and start a riot as a pretext to enter the area and divide up the land. “It’s starting next week so they want to build a team and go down there,” said a WhatsApp audio message, which has been passed on to the Guardian., This is not the first menace to the indigenous community, which has previously ejected illegal settlers and faced death threats. But villagers say the pandemic has strengthened the hand of criminals against the already reduced authorities., “The invaders know that this disease is weakening the inspection bodies even more,” one of the villagers, Awapy Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, told the environmental group., WWF Brazil plans to donate 14 drones to indigenous communities and local governments so they can conduct their own real-time surveillance. “Never has this been more important than during the current global health crisis, when official monitoring is being scaled back, bringing the threat of an escalation of invasions on indigenous territories” said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF UK., On the first flight over Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territory, locals discovered 1.4 hectares had been cleared without their knowledge last year and they have recently spotted planes dropping grass seeds on the area so the land can be used for cattle grazing., The Yanomami territory in Roraima state has seen an influx of illegal miners. Although this started before the pandemic, environmental groups fear the trend will accelerate because the crisis has pushed up the price of gold and the economic downturn that is forecast to follow will push more people to seek another source of income., Tensions over land and natural resources have been rising for some time, sometimes leading to murderous violence. On Tuesday, Brazilian media reported the killing of an indigenous forest guardian in Maranhão. Zezico Rodrigues Guajajara, a teacher and leader, was the fifth member of the Guajarajara community to be murdered since November. The circumstances are now under investigation., “I’m the most wanted of the leaders by the invaders and pistoleiros gunslingers,” he had previously told the journalist and academic Scott Wallace., Zezico Rodrigues Guajajara was murdered this morning in Maranhão, Brazil.

A global economic downturn will probably suppress demand for meat, timber, minerals, soy and other Amazon produce, which could ease pressure on the forest., But this will be countered by the likely domestic recession in Brazil, which could drive more poor people to clear land for subsistence cultivation., The health risks of such invasions are also enormous. Bolsonaro has gone further than Donald Trump in rejecting scientific advice about the need for isolation measures and quarantines to halt the spread of the disease., He has actively encouraged people to flout restrictions put in place by state governors, joined mass rallies of supporters and touted medically unfounded claims about remedies and the innate resistance of Brazilian people., This has been met with international condemnation and particular concern from indigenous groups in Brazil, who have proven horrifyingly vulnerable to previous disease outbreaks. Up to 90% of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas may have been wiped out by measles, smallpox and other diseases brought by European invaders in the 16th and 17th centuries, according to recent studies., Many indigenous people are now retreating to their villages in the forest and blocking outside traffic. They have put out an appeal for extra food and medical assistance, and decried the government’s handling of the crisis, which they say has made a bad situation worse., Although the government has imposed restrictions on visitors to indigenous territory due to health concerns, this could work to the benefit of criminals, said Antonio Oviedo, monitoring coordinator of Brazil’s biggest environmental NGO, Instituto Socioambiental., “There are rules forbidding entry into indigenous lands and conservation areas,” he said. “But land grabbers, illegal loggers and illegal miners do not follow the rules.”brazil amazon protection coronavirus fire season", "label": 0}, "train-596": {"text": "\nCountry diary: carrion crows construct their high-rise abode\n, Langstone, Hampshire: The pair get to work high in the canopy, preparing their nest and seeing off predators, \nClaire Stares, \n\nFri 3 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Apr 2020 08.13 EDT\n\n, Spurred into action by the spring sunshine, our resident carrion crows have one thing on their minds. Just as they’ve done for the past five years, this pair have begun to build on the foundations of last year’s nest, high in the crown of a statuesque oak – the tallest tree in their territory., Unlike rooks and jackdaws, which are social species and tend to nest in colonies, carrion crows are fairly solitary birds. Reaching sexual maturity at about three years of age, they form socially monogamous but genetically promiscuous pairings. This means that, while they typically mate for life, extra-pair copulation between a female and a male other than her pair-bonded mate is not unusual., The nest is about 15 metres up, near the top of the canopy, close to the trunk and wedged securely between two thick forked limbs. From afar it looks like a platform of jumbled sticks, but through my spotting scope I can see that it is in fact cup-shaped., Once the tree is in leaf, the nest will be concealed from sight, but for now it is in full view of predators and, though they have yet to lay, the crows are actively defending their territory, mobbing the local buzzards as they circle overhead, and seeing off passing sparrowhawks and kestrels. For another measure of protection, they have constructed a decoy nest in a neighbouring tree, conspicuously sited on an outer branch., The male and female have been working together to construct their high-rise abode, taking it in turns to alight on my silver birch and break off twigs. Whippy and full of sap, these don’t snap cleanly. One bird vigorously bends them back and forth, almost toppling over with the effort. The other takes a different approach, twisting a twig to weaken the wood fibres, then tugging it free., These charismatic corvids are often considered to be bad omens. However, as with magpies, in some cultures it is not the mere sighting of a crow but the number of birds that is significant – two crows are lucky, three bring health and four wealth. During this tumultuous time, the presence of this pair of black-feathered beauties is certainly bringing me joy., • The first picture on this article was changed on 3 April 2020 because an earlier image was of jackdaws, not carrion crows.country diary carrion crows construct their high rise abode", "label": 0}, "train-597": {"text": "\nRescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?\n, \nRescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?\n, As global heating makes coral bleaching a regular event, scientists are urgently seeking ways to help the world’s biggest reef survive, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 16.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Apr 2020 00.54 EDT\n\n, When coral scientist Dr Zoe Richards left the Great Barrier Reef’s Lizard Island in late January, she was feeling optimistic., Richards is a taxonomist. Since 2011 she has recorded and monitored 245 coral species at 14 locations around the island’s research station, about 270km north of Cairns., In 2017 she saw “mass destruction of the reef”. Back-to-back mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017, and cyclones in 2014 and 2015, had wreaked havoc., But in January, she saw thousands of new colonies of fast-growing Acropora corals that had “claimed the space” left by dead and degraded corals. In a three-year window without spiralling heat or churning cyclones, some corals were in an adolescent bloom – not mature enough to spawn, but getting close., “It was an incredible recovery,” says Richards, of Curtin University. “But I knew if it was hit again, it would be trouble – and that’s exactly what happened.”, In 2020, mass bleaching returned to Lizard Island – perhaps not as badly as in previous years – but enough, says Richards, to turn the clock back on the recovery she had seen., Day 1 of coral biodiversity re-surveys @ Lizard I, GBR. After 2 cyclones &amp; 2 bleaching events in a decade, it's great to see a range of healthy young Acropora colonies fighting back! #coralnotcoal#recoveryispossibleA. echinata (blue), A. speciosa (pink) &amp; A. spathulata (orange) pic.twitter.com/CO7BhJdu72, This summer has delivered a third mass bleaching for the reef in just five years. The back-to-back bleaching of 2016 and 2017 was mostly confined to the northern and central sections., Data from aerial surveys is still being analysed, but the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has said preliminary results suggest the 2020 bleaching had a much broader footprint., When bleaching is mild, corals can and do recover, although it can make them more susceptible to disease. But severe bleaching can kill corals. Estimates are that the 2016 bleaching killed about 29% of the reef’s shallow water corals and the 2017 event took another 19%., Some scientists are now concerned global heating may have reached a point where tropical reefs bleach almost every year., What this means for the reef in the coming decades is an area of live research and debate among scientists., Scientists Guardian Australia spoke to say the reef’s fortunes hang on the answers to two questions., The first is whether governments around the world will make deeper cuts to greenhouse gas emissions than they have already agreed and, if so, how close they will get to keeping global heating to 1.5C., A second is whether efforts to first identify and then deploy a swathe of potential measures that could reduce the impact of rising temperatures will be successful., What seems clear is that without some human intervention, the magic of the world’s greatest coral reef system will be lost., Prof Peter Mumby, professor of coral reef ecology at the University of Queensland, is the chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Foundation – the once-small not-for-profit that was awarded a controversial $443m government grant in 2018., I’m fearful that in the next 10 years we will see the loss of coral across the planet at phenomenal rates, He said the 2020 bleaching “is giving us greater pause, given it seems we can see quite frequent coral bleaching events earlier than people had previously expected”., Mumby says bleaching events have been “patchy”, and the fact that some areas have escaped “means there’s an opportunity for management”., What keeps the reef functioning as a single ecosystem is the way each reef connects to another through the way corals reproduce. They all either spawn, or produce larvae, that can float in the water column and settle on nearby reefs., Mumby and colleagues have identified about 100 reefs along the GBR that are well spread, well connected to other reefs by ocean currents, and tend to experience cooler temperatures., He says making sure those reefs stay as healthy as possible – in particular by managing outbreaks of the coral-eating crown of thorns starfish – could be crucial in keeping the wider reef viable., The reef’s unrivalled size and diversity – almost 4,000 reefs, cays and islands stretching for more than 2,000 kilometres – gives it extra resilience, he says., Climate change is still the reef’s biggest threat and society will need to focus on tackling it, “but there needs to be a way to adapt to how we manage reefs so that they can roll with the punches – we have to do both those things”., The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences (AIMS) has produced an as-yet unpublished study, sent to the federal government, that reviews more than 160 different interventions that have been suggested for the reef, identifying about 40 that could be worth further study., Dr Lina Bay, a principal research scientists at AIMS, says one promising area of study is what’s known as “assisted gene flow”, where the spawn of corals with better tolerance for heat could be captured and then dispersed., “Not all corals are created equal,” she says. “Some have a higher stress tolerance than others. Over many years we’ve shown that the variation in bleaching tolerance is hereditable – it gets passed from parents to offspring.”, She says these differences can exist even among the same species, meaning those corals can be selectively grown in a lab setting to promote more heat tolerance., AIMS scientist Dr Neal Cantin has just finished a three-year experiment with one fast-growing coral species called Pocillopora acuta, which behaves like a weed by filling in the gaps when less hardy corals die off., Starting with 90 parent specimens taken from three different parts of the Great Barrier Reef, Cantin and colleagues grew 7,500 offspring and then subjected them to rising levels of CO2 and temperatures of up to 2C warming., Even at high temperatures, some of these corals survived, and they were able to tolerate higher levels of heat as the experiment went on., Having a street-fighting weedy coral like this is important, says Cantin. Dead areas of coral reefs tend to get covered in algae, but Cantin says a weedy coral that can compete with the algae can then make room for slower-growing corals to also grow., “The whole goal of a lot of these interventions is to work with species that can be successful on their own. We won’t be able to work with 600 species of corals, but we could probably work with 20 that fill the functional roles of a healthy reef community., “You can’t deny bleaching events are becoming more frequent and more severe and they’re impacting across a bigger area than before. We can just document that demise, or we can learn from it and have some corals for future generations.”, That demise is clear and it happens at scale, and also in detail. Zoe Richards has already seen evidence of likely local extinctions of some corals at Lizard Island. One is a spiralised plate coral – Acropora clathrata – that she hasn’t been able to find for years., “It’s these silent extinctions that go on,” she says., “The entire reef is operating like one big meta population with sub-populations that are connected to each other. If you successively take out nodes in that population, sooner or later you will end up with parts that don’t connect. It will be fragmented into subsets that will continue to erode in terms of diversity. It’s degradation of the coral community at a very large scale.”, Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland, has done pioneering work on the study of coral bleaching going back to the mid-1980s., He remembers Lizard Island as a “picture perfect” place to do research on corals in the late 80s, when his research there found rising temperatures caused corals to lose their “symbionts” – the algae that lives in the coral and gives them much of their nutrients and colour., The Great Barrier Reef’s first major mass bleaching event happened in 1998. There was another in 2002, and again in 2016, 2017 and 2020., Hoegh-Guldberg says: “We knew there was a temperature effect, and we knew that temperatures were going up. At the end of the 90s, I could put those two things together.”, The year after the reef’s first mass bleaching, Hoegh-Guldberg took climate models to forecast that if greenhouse gas emissions kept growing then, by 2020, “the average bleaching event is likely to be similar or greater than the 1998 event”., As 2020 approached, the models showed reefs across the northern, central and southern regions would see between eight and 10 bleaching events per decade., “I wished I’d been wrong” he says. “I think I said at the time that I’d have egg on my face if I was wrong. But there’s no egg on my face.”, Hoegh-Guldberg says manually replanting corals is uneconomic at scale but there’s merit in helping the dispersal of coral larvae, pointing to a technique being developed by a scientist at Southern Cross University that captures millions of larvae in floating pools., But he says the main game is keeping global heating down., “Let’s say we get to 1.5C and then we can stabilise – that’s really the last call for reefs. Corals will come back and there will be winners and losers, but you’ll have a functional reef that supports fisheries and tourism.”, The problem is that right now, government pledges under the Paris agreement are enough to raise temperatures by 3C – not 1.5C., “At 2C all the reef-building corals have plummeted and instead you are looking at the dominance of other organisms like algae. At 3C you basically have nothing., “I’m fearful that in the next 10 years we will see the loss of coral across the planet at phenomenal rates,” he says. “That’s what keeps me up at night.”rescuing the great barrier reef how much can be saved and how can we do it", "label": 0}, "train-598": {"text": "\nCrossbreeding corals: the hunt for ways to heal the Great Barrier Reef\n, Crossbreeding corals: the hunt for ways to heal the Great Barrier Reef, Scientists, farmers and volunteers are looking for ways to lessen the impact of climate change as experts warn a third mass bleaching has taken place, by Johan Augustin, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 05.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Apr 2020 09.30 EDT\n\n, One of the dive instructors points out two blacktip reef sharks circling a docile green turtle busy grazing on algae. Stingrays of various sizes, colours and shapes pass beneath us. Suddenly, a pod of dolphins appears, swimming over the hard corals., The dive takes place on what appears to be healthy and pristine coral reef surrounding Lady Elliot Island, at the very southern end of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef off Queensland., There are no visible signs of the bleaching that has plagued other parts of the reef for some years, but the government agency responsible for the reef, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, has confirmed that the natural landmark has suffered a third mass coral bleaching episode in five years, describing the damage as “very widespread”. Mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 hit vast areas of the reef., As the rate at which bleaching events hit the world’s biggest reef system increases, scientists, farmers and volunteers across Queensland are trying to do their bit to lessen the impact., Gary Spotswood is a third-generation farmer at Mt Alma Organics, an organic farm a couple of hours drive from Townsville, a city on the north-eastern coast of Queensland. Spotswood has installed pumps to accumulate the run-off on his 430 acres, which then filters through aquatic plants growing in the adjacent wetlands. The project is partly funded by a grant from the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, which was awarded a controversial A$444m (£217m)  from the Australian government to sponsor projects on the reef., “I try to keep as much water on the land as possible,” says Spotswood, who leads courses in land use for other farmers and graziers. “Changes take time. But in five years people have changed their habits in how they use the land,” he says., At Townsville’s tropical marine research centre, scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) are looking at how so-called super corals (corals that can resist increased water temperatures) could be used to save the reefs. About 25 strains of coral are being crossbred with the same or different species. The research is being carried out in the National Sea Simulator, the world’s most advanced research aquarium, and intends to show that young coral offspring – produced from mixing corals from various parts of the reef – can survive in warmer sea temperatures., “It’s like crossbreeding corn. We do the same thing with the corals, so they can withstand higher temperatures,” says Kate Quigley, a researcher on reef restoration at Aims., The method is called “assisted gene flow”, and although at an early stage, shows encouraging results in the sea simulator, as well as on the reef – where cross-fertilised corals have been transplanted. The hybrids have one parent from the northern parts and one parent from the central reefs, and the results show that corals with at least one parent from the more heat-resistant northern reefs survive when placed in cooler environments. The research has also confirmed that the offspring inherit heat tolerance from their northern parents, and these genes may ultimately be passed on to make reefs more heat resistant., Aims also conducts research on how to decrease the numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish (cots), which prey upon corals. There are currently more than five million cots on the reefs between Cairns and Cooktown, and the invasion spreads south as the heavily spined species (which normally range from 25–35cm across, and can have up to 23 arms) devours corals and leaves nothing but traces of fine calcium carbonate. , Female cots can produce up to 50 million eggs a year and each one annually ingests 10 square metres of coral. Rising sea temperatures and increased availability of nutrients due to run-off from farming practices are said to be behind the rise in cot numbers. So far divers have culled about half a million by injecting the starfish with white vinegar., Scientists at Aims are attempting to wield another – more natural weapon – to combat the mass outbreak. They breed the rare giant triton, a large marine snail that feeds on cots. The scientists aim to reintroduce the snails on reefs – from where they have disappeared. , The climate crisis and evidence of another mass bleaching, however, continue to overshadow any sign of progress., Quigley says hundreds of studies point in the same direction. “They are showing that climate change is the biggest threat against the reef,” she says. “We don’t know what the future reefs look like. But we need to mitigate the effects that climate change has on the corals.”crossbreeding corals breathing new life into the great barrier reef aoe", "label": 0}, "train-599": {"text": "\n'Circular economy': the tannery making leather from billy goats\n, A growing micro-tannery sector in the UK is helping to create value for thousands of male goats that would otherwise be killed at birth, \nAnna Turns, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 04.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Apr 2020 05.31 EDT\n\n, Jack Millington walks past two huge industrial-style wooden tanning drums, through a door into the well-insulated drying room. Here, at 35C, amid the whirring of the dehumidifier and one small electric heater, hides from billy goats are stretched out on racks to dry., Strong yet silky soft to touch, the beauty of the hides lies in the details – from the natural texture of the grain to the spine marks visible down the centre of each pale brown goatskin. “Every hide is different – these patterns are almost like a fingerprint and that’s exciting to see for the first time as they dry,” says Millington, 31., Millington’s micro-tannery near Market Harborough in the Midlands is the final step in making full use of the thousands of male or “billy” goats that would otherwise be killed at birth., Although still dwarfed in size by the dairy cow sector, the UK’s commercial goat-milking herd now numbers around 50,000 animals. The controversy around the killing of male dairy calves at birth has prompted efforts to find markets for the animals. But far less attention has been paid to the male billy goats being killed soon after birth.The Goat Veterinary Society estimates around 3,000 billy goat kids are slaughtered every year because they are unwanted, with only milk-producing females deemed useful., One of the few outlets for billies in the UK is goat meat distributor Cabrito, which buys goat meat from dairy farms that keep and rear their billies until around seven months old before slaughter., But before Millington’s tannery, there had been no outlet for the hides, with goatskins considered a biohazard by abattoirs and mostly incinerated., Millington came into the industry by accident. Previously working in advertising, he had been trying to help his dairy farmer Dad to find a market for his goat meat when he discovered the masses of goatskins being discarded., Unable to find a facility that could process smaller, less sought-after goatskins, Millington enlisted experts at the University of Northampton to develop a bespoke tanning recipe using natural bark extracts, then set about creating his own purpose-built micro-tannery.The tanning process, which takes up to two weeks, starts when the raw hides arrive from the abattoir. They are covered in salt to preserve the skins and draw out moisture, then the traditional “beamhouse operation” begins. Initially, lime powder is added to a small batch of 70 or so skins in the first drum which spins intermittently to remove the hair and plump the skin up into a thick jelly-like material. Powdered enzyme is then added to break down proteins in the skin and once in the second drum, hides are pickled with rock salt and acid solution. Finally, non-toxic mimosa bark tannins are added to colour the leather overnight. Once tanned, skins are dyed and finished at a local family-run leather finishing company and handcrafted into luxury bags, wallets, made-to-order shoes and bespoke commissions such as the aprons for staff at SILO, London’s zero waste restaurant., While most leather companies won’t mention that their fabric comes from livestock, Millington is totally open about the connection between leather and the food industry. All of the billies ultimately used by the tannery come from farms supplying Cheshire-based Delamere Dairy, which processes a third of the UK’s goat milk. “The leather industry is so misunderstood. People don’t think about where leather comes from, but it’s a natural by-product. The connection between the meat and dairy system and the leather industry has been forgotten, but they are inextricably linked,” says Millington, who launched Billy Tannery three years ago and now sources all his hides from Cabrito.“We’re repurposing a bi-product that comes from an inherently wasteful food system to make a material that’s biodegradable, natural and beautiful,” he adds.“It doesn’t do anyone any favours to talk about the males in the dairy system, it’s not in the farmers’ interests, retailers’, or consumers’ interest to dig that much,” explains Cabrito’s founder James Whetlor., “But if you’re a vegetarian who eats goat’s cheese, you’re directly contributing to a system that euthanises animals at birth, so if you care about the circular economy, the sustainability of industries and reducing the impact of your food on the planet, you should be eating goat meat,” he says.Sending the hides to Millington’s tannery is the “last piece of the puzzle”, says Whetlor, and ends another unnecessary waste in the goat dairy system. “200 years ago no one would have dreamt of knocking a perfectly healthy animal on the head at birth, and 100 years ago no one would have dreamt of throwing these hides away. Small artisan production has never had the built-in waste and obsolescence which is part of the modern-day food system,” he says.circular economy the tannery making leather from billy goats", "label": 0}, "train-600": {"text": "\nMonopoly houses, toy soldiers and Lego: the museum of plastic lost at sea\n, \nMonopoly houses, toy soldiers and Lego: the museum of plastic lost at sea\n, The waste washing up on British beaches is a shocking but fascinating catalogue of our times, \nAndrew Male, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 04.30 EDT\n\n, Tracey Williams has been a beachcomber for most of her life. It started with school holidays to north Cornwall in the 1960s, searching for shells, sea glass and mermaids’ purses among the rocks and sand. In the 1980s, after her parents moved to a 300-year-old clifftop house in Bigbury-on-Sea, in south Devon, Williams and her father would seek out fossils in their back garden and down by the shore., “But I’d also find old bottles, figurines, medieval rings, and bring them in, clean them up,” she says. “You know, chance finds.” Then, 23 years ago, everything changed. “I started finding Lego pieces washed up on the shore,” she explains. “Flippers, scuba tanks, the occasional dragon or octopus. By that time I had two young children, and we could take buckets down to the beach and just fill them with the amount of Lego coming in.”, The Lego had come from a spill on 13 February 1997, when a cargo ship called the Tokio Express was hit by a freak wave off the coast of Cornwall, spilling 62 containers into the sea, including one filled with nearly 5m pieces of Lego, bound for New York., We only see what floats ashore. How many billions of items from cargo spills are lying on the seabed?, At first, Williams says, the Lego collecting was “a bit of fun” on summer holidays, something she forgot about once her children started secondary school. Then, about 10 years ago, she moved to Newquay. “And I went down to Perranporth beach and there was the Lego, still coming in.”, Williams’ perspective changed. “There was just so much plastic on the beach and I started to wonder where it had all come from.” She got a dog, a collie/spaniel cross called Jess, and together they walked the coastline every day, Williams collecting and documenting the plastic debris. She set up Facebook pages recording her finds, including one called Lego Lost At Sea. Others started to get in touch, growing into a community of 50,000 followers, with beachcombers around the world monitoring where the Lego and other cargo spills were turning up, and in what quantities., “We’ve had people contacting us about washed-up spills of Nike trainers. Hewlett-Packard cartridges, all with the same batch number. Hewlett-Packard didn’t disclose exactly where the spill took place, but they reached Florida, Bermuda, Norway… ”, Initially mapping the spills with a fellow beachcomber, Williams then teamed up with oceanographers and universities to help research the weathering and persistence of plastic in the marine environments. She also started to catalogue her finds, which she calls “artefacts of the Anthropocene”, arranged into colour-coded grids that bear a striking resemblance to the drawers of peculiar ethnographic objects in Oxford’s Pitt Rivers Museum, pieces of disposable history arranged with a scientific reverence; a taxonomy of plastic., “I see them all as ingredients in the plastic soup,” Williams says. “Look closely at the grids, and you’ll see Lego and children’s toys, but also Rawlplugs, tile spacers, Monopoly houses, cigarillo tips, curtain hooks, biofilters, Smarties tube lids, fishing beads, broken security seals, razor parts, bits of toothbrushes, roofing screw caps, medical lancets, golf tees, false teeth, plastic soldiers, posties’ rubber bands, bungs and stoppers.”, Some of the items in these grids – cowboys and submarines from Kellogg’s cereals, a Talon jet car – are children’s toys from the 1950s and early 60s. Williams recently found a Hax strawberry-shaped syrup bottle that, according to the Museum of Design in Plastics, might be 70 years old., “It just doesn’t go away,” she says. “It’s also important to remember that, of all the plastic that enters the ocean, 70% sinks to the bottom. We only see what floats ashore. How many billions of items from cargo spills are lying on the seabed? What does the bottom of the ocean look like?”, The collages aren’t meant to be beautiful. They are our history, but also my bewilderment, frustration, dismay, Williams posts most of her grids and montages on her Twitter account, @LegoLostAtSea, which she refers to as her “online journal”. She describes what she’s doing as effectively an archaeology of the future. “Unless you record it,” she says, “how do people make sense of it? Sometimes you find a piece of plastic with a brand name in it. You’ll Google it. Nothing comes up. Each of these items has a history that involved a company, a designer, factory staff, totally forgotten. Very often, the seaweed washes up all these tiny blobs of grey plastic. I was in London one day, walking past Selfridges, and they had a display of old electronic equipment, circuit boards from televisions, computers… I thought, that’s it! It’s the colour of that plastic from old electrical goods. How will the archaeologist of the future make sense of that?”, A look through Williams’ extensive archive of beach photos reveals far more distressing images than the ones she presents on her Twitter feed: photos of dead birds caught in marine debris, trash piles of plastic and discarded fishing gear. She saves these images for news agencies and charities. The job of the @LegoLostAtSea account is something different – to focus on our disposable material culture and the stories behind it., “It’s all our fault,” she says, “but I would say most people have no idea that their old possessions are washing up on the beach, whether from storm drains, or landfill sites washing into the sea. I’m finding lots of pieces of cut-up credit cards at the moment. What I’m trying to do is seek out things that interest me and might interest other people. Everything you find is a sort of message in a bottle. I’m interested in the story behind it.”, When people tell Williams that they also find her colour-coded grids of plastic trash strangely beautiful, or consider them works of art, she balks. “The collages aren’t meant to be beautiful,” she says. “They’re not art. The emotions I feel when on a wild, windswept beach at dawn or dusk might be excitement, anticipation, but not at the plastic. What you’re looking at in those montages is our history, but also my bewilderment, frustration, dismay.”, Yet there are positives. Williams thinks that charting the Lego spill has helped raise awareness. “It’s encouraged people to get into beach cleaning and other environmental action,” she says, “and it helps explain things like ocean currents and the dangers of plastic pollution. Although so much plastic on the beach can be overwhelming, sorting through it can be strangely cathartic. It’s order from chaos.” , • Tracey Williams is compiling a book of her images; go to @LegoLostAtSea to see more of her work.monopoly houses toy soldiers lego museum of plastic lost at sea", "label": 0}, "train-601": {"text": "\nStinkbug invasion in Turkey threatens world hazelnut supplies\n, Scientists race to halt spread of pungent insect species after it sweeps eight cities, Selin Ugurtas in Istanbul, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 04.00 EDT\n\n, The world’s hazelnut supplies could be threatened by a stinkbug that has recently invaded Turkey, scientists have warned., The brown marmorated stinkbug, which is native to north-east Asia, has been spreading across the world in shipping containers, breeding freely thanks to warmer temperatures and a lack of natural predators. , The stinkbug– named for the pungent chemicals it produces as a form of defence – was seen in Turkey for the first time in 2017, after wreaking havoc in neighbouring Georgia. Since then, the insect has spread through at least eight Turkish cities, mostly across the Black Sea region, where about 70% of the world’s hazelnut supply originates., If the stinkbug’s spread cannot be contained, about 30% of hazelnuts could be damaged, warned Prof Celal Tuncer from Ondokuz Mayıs University’s plant protection department. This corresponds to about a fifth of the world’s supply., This dependence on Turkish hazelnuts has prompted the industry as well as scientists to call for rapid action against the stinkbug. , At a conference in January, discussions focused on fighting the invasion through the dissemination of a natural enemy: Trissolcus japonicus, commonly known as the samurai wasp. The method of using pests’ natural enemies is known as biological control, and is considered an eco-friendly alternative to the use of insecticides., Samurai wasps, tiny creatures of two millimetres, lay their larvae inside the stinkbugs’ eggs, which are then destroyed., One potential problem with this approach is that it usually requires more time than Turkey’s hazelnuts appear to have. Regulations require extensive research before releasing a biocontrol agent in order to ensure that it is not harmful to the local ecosystem., In the US, for instance, the bureaucratic procedures of releasing the samurai wasp took so long that eventually the species found its way there naturally., Tuncer said Turkey should seek ways to expedite the process by relying on existing research elsewhere, as a considerable amount of preliminary research has already been completed in Europe., İlyas Edip Sevinç, the head of the Black Sea Region Hazelnut and Hazelnut Products Exporters’ Association, said taking time to thoroughly analyse the risks of samurai wasps would be ill-advised as the stinkbug was already established and posed such a threat., So far, farmers have been relying on insecticides against the stinkbug, but this may prove more difficult as the population increases and spreads across the region., Temperatures in the coming months will play a crucial role in the health of this year’s hazelnut crop. In 2019, chilly weather delayed the stinkbugs’ emergence from hibernation, allowing the nuts enough time to grow their protective outer shells. This year, meteorologists have warned of above-average temperatures, meaning the nuts may not be as fortunate.stinkbug invasion turkey threatens world hazelnut supplies", "label": 0}, "train-602": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a wild hyacinth by another name\n, Marshwood Vale, Dorset: The first few bluebells are emerging, offering promise of an abundance to come, \nSara Hudston, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, This is the best time of year for greggles. In a couple of weeks, millions of them will wash the woods an intoxicating violet-blue. But it’s now they are most poignant, when the first, sparse, flowers offer a promise of abundance to come., “Greggles” was an old Dorset term for bluebells, used by Thomas Hardy in The Mayor of Casterbridge. As his young heroine ascends the social scale she learns to avoid dialect words, “those terrible marks of the beast to the truly genteel”, and call them “wild hyacinths” instead., Bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) spend most of their time underground. The bulbs are self-burying, burrowing deep where the soil is soft. As they grow, the roots contract, hauling themselves down more than 10cm into the woodland floor., Once a year, each plant sends up a few long pointed leaves to pierce the surface. In Dorset, these begin to appear in January, poking out of the mulch like bunches of green plastic straws. The smooth, slightly shiny leaves are triangular in section, with one side developing a folded groove. Despite their robust appearance, the plants are highly sensitive to crushing. Trample them and you damage their ability to photosynthesise, and they can take a long time to recover., By mid-March, in sheltered places and sunny weather, they begin to lift flower stems, each tipped with a head of greeny-purple buds. Bluebells are part of the Asparagaceae family and it’s at this stage, when their poisonous ends look a little like asparagus spears, that the botanical relationship is clearest., Another few days and the stems lengthen, the ends droop and the bells begin to hang in elongated drops, each on its own thin stalk. Crouch down close and you can catch a faint bloom of scent, the smell of spring being released from the earth., Bluebells are rich in nectar and creamy-white pollen, which provides one of the best early food sources for insects. Bumblebees sometimes bite through the bottom of the flower in their hunger to reach the nectary., This April, many of us will be starved of outdoor sweetness and will have to imagine the perfume and colour seeping through the woods.country diary a wild hyacinth by any other name bluebells", "label": 0}, "train-603": {"text": "'Bad news': radiation 16 times above normal after forest fire near Chernobyl, The blaze started on Saturday close to the site of the world’s worst ever nuclear disaster, Ukrainian officials have sought calm after forest fires in the restricted zone around Chernobyl, scene of the world’s worst nuclear accident, led to a rise in radiation levels., Firefighters said they had managed to put out the smaller of two forest fires that began at the weekend, apparently after someone began a grass fire, and had deployed more than 100 firefighters backed by planes and helicopters to extinguish the remaining blaze., The fire had caused radiation fears in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, which is located about 60 miles south of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Government specialists on Monday sent to monitor the situation reported that there was no rise in radiation levels in Kyiv or the city suburbs., “You don’t have to be afraid of opening your windows and airing out your home during the quarantine,” wrote Yegor Firsov, head of Ukraine’s state ecological inspection service, in a Facebook post about the results of the radiation tests., As of Monday afternoon, the country’s emergency ministry said that the remaining fire in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone covered about 20 hectares and was still being extinguished. Footage released by the ministry showed firefighters dousing flames on the forest floor, and clouds of smoke rising., Police have arrested a suspect believed to have caused the blaze, a 27-year-old man from the area who reportedly told police he had set grass and rubbish on fire in three places “for fun”. After he had lit the fires, he said, the wind had picked up and he had been unable to extinguish them., An earlier post by Firsov had warned about heightened radiation levels at the site of the fire, which he said had been caused by the “barbaric” practice of local grass fires often started in the spring and autumn. “There is bad news – radiation is above normal in the fire’s centre,” Firsov wrote on Sunday., The post included a video with a Geiger counter showing radiation at 16 times above normal. The fire had spread to about 100 hectares of forest, Firsov wrote., The country’s emergency ministry put out a warning for Kyiv on Monday about poor air quality but said it was related to meteorological conditions, and not to the fire., The service had said on Saturday that increased radiation in some areas had led to “difficulties” in fighting the fire, while stressing that people living nearby were not in danger. On Monday, it said that gamma radiation levels had not risen near the fire., Chernobyl polluted a large area of Europe when its fourth reactor exploded in April 1986, with the region immediately around the power plant the worst affected. People are not allowed to live within 30km of the power station., The three other reactors at Chernobyl continued to generate electricity until the power station finally closed in 2000.

His work is contentious, he says, because it calls into question the superiority of humans, \nAmy Fleming, \n\nSun 5 Apr 2020 16.06 EDT\n\n\nFirst published on Sun 5 Apr 2020 09.00 EDT\n\n, I had hoped to interview the plant neurobiologist Stefano Mancuso at his laboratory at the University of Florence. I picture it as a botanical utopia: a place where flora is respected for its awareness and intelligence; where sensitive mimosa plants can demonstrate their long memories; and where humans are invited to learn how to be a better species by observing the behaviour of our verdant fellow organisms., But because we are both on lockdown, we Skype from our homes. Instead of meeting his clever plants, I make do with admiring a pile of cannonball-like pods from an aquatic species, on the bookshelves behind him. “They’re used for propagation,” he says. “I am always collecting seeds.”, Before Mancuso’s lab started work in 2005, plant neurobiology was largely seen as a laughable concept. “We were interested in problems that were, until that moment, just related to animals, like intelligence and even behaviour,” he says. At the time, it was “almost forbidden” to talk about behaviour in plants. But “we study how plants are able to solve problems, how they memorise, how they communicate, how they have their social life and things like that”., Mancuso and his colleagues have become experts in training plants, just like neuroscientists train lab rats. If you let a drop of water fall on a Mimosa pudica, its kneejerk response is to recoil its leaves, but, if you continue doing so, the plant will quickly cotton on that the water is harmless and stop reacting. The plants can hold on to this knowledge for weeks, even when their living conditions, such as lighting, are changed. “That was unexpected because we were thinking about very short memories, in the range of one or two days – the average memory of insects,” says Mancuso. “To find that plants were able to memorise for two months was a surprise.” Not least because they don’t have brains., In a plant, a single brain would be a fatal flaw because they have evolved to be lunch. “Plants use a very different strategy,” says Mancuso. “They are very good at diffusing the same function all over the body.” You can remove 90% of a plant without killing it. “You need to imagine a plant as a huge brain. Maybe not as efficient as in the case of animals, but diffused everywhere.”, One of the most controversial aspects of Mancuso’s work is the idea of plant consciousness. As we learn more about animal and plant intelligence, not to mention human intelligence, the always-contentious term consciousness has become the subject of ever more heated scientific and philosophical debate. “Let’s use another term,” Mancuso suggests. “Consciousness is a little bit tricky in both our languages. Let’s talk about awareness. Plants are perfectly aware of themselves.” A simple example is when one plant overshadows another – the shaded plant will grow faster to reach the light. But when you look into the crown of a tree, all the shoots are heavily shaded. They do not grow fast because they know that they are shaded by part of themselves. “So they have a perfect image of themselves and of the outside,” says Mancuso., When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, the plant emits a distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate them, Science struggles to view plants as active and motivated because its outlook is so humancentric, he argues. One test for self-awareness in animals is whether they can look in a mirror and understand that they are looking at themselves. “Very few animals are able to do this,” says Mancuso. “Humans, dolphins, a few apes and probably elephants. This has been taken in recent years as a kind of evidence that just these few groups of animals have self-awareness.” Mancuso believes this is wrong. “My personal opinion is that there is no life that is not aware of itself. For me, it’s impossible to imagine any form of life that is not able to be intelligent, to solve problems.”, Another misconception is that plants are the definition of a vegetative state – incommunicative and insensitive to what is around them. But Mancuso says plants are far more sensitive than animals. “And this is not an opinion. This is based on thousands of pieces of evidence. We know that a single root apex is able to detect at least 20 different chemical and physical parameters, many of which we are blind to.” There could be a tonne of cobalt or nickel under our feet, and we would have no idea, whereas “plants can sense a few milligrams in a huge amount of soil”, he says., Far from being silent and passive, plants are social and communicative, above ground and beneath, through their roots and fungal networks. They are adept at detecting subtle electromagnetic fields generated by other life forms. They use chemicals and scents to warn each other of danger, deter predators and attract pollinating insects. When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, for example, the plant emits a chemical distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate the caterpillars., Plants respond to sound, too, “feeling” vibrations all over. “Plants are extremely good at detecting specific kinds of sounds, for example at 200hz or 300hz … because they are seeking the sound of running water.” If you put a source of 200hz sound close to the roots of a plant, he says, they will follow it. There is no evidence that the human voice benefits plants, although talking to plants may soothe the humans doing it., Another reason we overlook plants’ intelligence is their vastly slower pace of life. In Mancuso’s new book, The Incredible Journey of Plants, we meet the world’s oldest plant – Old Tjikko – a red fir tree whose roots have writhed in the Swedish earth for about 9,560 years. We are also introduced to the ingenious seeds of crimson fountain grass, which choose not to germinate until the conditions are perfect – and can survive for six years while waiting., The main thrust of the book is that plants were the original pioneers and have been forever exploring the planet. Mancuso eschews the notion of “native species” and prizes so-called invasive species above all else. “The more invasive they are, the more I like them, because they are the most brilliant example of the ability to solve problems,” he says. “Invasive species are the most beautiful plants that I can imagine.” For Mancuso, “migration is one of the most important forces of nature. All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural.” , Although new generations of botanists are increasingly embracing plant neurobiology, Mancuso still has his detractors. Last summer, a group of eight plant scientists wrote in the journal Trends in Plant Science that Mancuso and his colleagues “have consistently glossed over the unique and remarkable degree of structural, organisational and functional complexity that the animal brain had to evolve before consciousness could emerge”. Mancuso says that almost all of these botanists are retired. “It’s an older generation of plant scientists that is completely against any notion of a plant as intelligent or behaving. For them, plants are kind of a semi-living organic machine.”, All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural, The notion that humans are the apex of life on Earth is one of the most dangerous ideas around, says Mancuso: “When you feel yourself better than all the other humans or other living organisms, you start to use them. This is exactly what we’ve been doing. We felt ourselves as outside nature.” The average lifespan of a species on Earth is between 2m and 5m years. “Homo sapiens have lived just 300,000 years,” he says – and already “we have been able to almost destroy our environment. From this point of view, how can we say that we are better organisms?”, Perhaps we should try – ahem – taking a leaf out of the plant kingdom’s book. Human societies and organisations are structured like our bodies – with a brain, or a top-level control centre, and various different organs governing specific functions. “We use this in our universities, our companies, even our class divisions,” says Mancuso. This structure enables us to move fast, physically and organisationally, but it also leaves us vulnerable. If a major organ fails, it could scupper everything, and top-down leadership rarely serves the whole., Plants, by contrast, “are kind of horizontal, diffusive, decentralised organisations that are much more in line with modernity”. Take the internet, the ultimate decentralised root system. “Look at the ability of Wikipedia to produce a wonderful amount of good-quality information by using a decentralised, diffused organisation. I’m claiming that, by studying plant networks, we can find wonderful solutions for us,” Or take the ethos of cooperation. Plants, say Mancuso, “are masters of starting symbiotic relationships with other organisms: bacteria, mushrooms, insects, even us. Just look at the way they use us to be transported all around the world.” We may think we have the upper hand, but plants may beg to differ., The Incredible Journey of Plants by Stefano Mancuso is published by Other Presssmarty plants are our vegetable cousins more intelligent than we realise", "label": 0}, "train-605": {"text": "\nHouseholds to be paid for daytime green electricity use during lockdown\n, Fall in energy use combined with bright, breezy weather leads to lowest electricity prices in 10 years, \nJillian Ambrose, \n\nSun 5 Apr 2020 09.33 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Apr 2020 11.10 EDT\n\n, Thousands of British homes will be paid to use electricity during the day for the first time, as wind and solar projects produce a surge in clean energy during the coronavirus lockdown., On Sunday morning, windfarms contributed almost 40% of the UK’s electricity, while solar power made up almost a fifth of the power system. Fossil fuels made up less than 15% of electricity, of which only 1.1% came from coal plants., Meanwhile, the country’s energy demand has fallen by around 10% due to the shutdown of pubs, restaurants, companies and factories across the country, leading to the lowest electricity market prices in 10 years., Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to £2,500 a month.

But the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and the bright spring weather mean some homes will be able to earn money while using clean electricity during the day for the first time., Households which use the Agile Octopus energy tariff, offered by Octopus Energy, were contacted on Saturday to let them know they would be paid for every kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity they use during the sunniest hours of Sunday afternoon., From 11am-4pm, those customers will earn 0.22p-3.3p per kWh to make use of the UK’s abundant clean energy, the company said., The coronavirus has caused the UK’s demand for electricity to fall by between 9% and 13% so far, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight. While home energy use is higher because people are self-isolating and working from home, the lockdown has led to a lower demand for electricity across the country due to the shutdown of “large electrical loads” such as factories, shops and railways., Energy bill savings are also likely for homes using variable energy tariffs, which track the wholesale energy markets., A slump in global gas market prices over the last year, combined with the lockdown, caused the wholesale price of electricity on the UK power markets to fall to £28 per megawatt hour (MWh) last week.

Without hope there’s no action., “People need to see these bleaching events not as depressing bits of news that adds to other depressing bits of news. They are clear signals the Great Barrier Reef is calling for urgent help and for us to do everything we can.”, Prof Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, surveyed 1,036 reefs from a plane over nine days in late March. The marine park authority also had an observer on the flights., Hughes has released maps showing severe levels of bleaching occurred in 2020 in all three sections of the reef – northern, central and southern – the first time this has happened since mass bleaching was first seen in 1998., Some 25% of the reefs were severely bleached – meaning that more than 60% of the corals on each reef had bleached., Hughes said previous observations had shown that bleaching at that extent leads to “high levels of mortality” of corals., The Great Barrier Reef has experienced five mass bleaching events – 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating., Hughes said there probably would not be the same level of coral death in the north and central regions in 2020 as in previous years, but this was partly because previous bleaching outbreaks had killed off the less heat-tolerant species., The #GreatBarrierReef has experienced the third mass coral bleaching event in five years, explains @ProfTerryHughes@jcu @CoralCoE @MorganPratchett pic.twitter.com/nAQOQWcgq5, The 2020 bleaching was second only to 2016 for severity, Hughes said., Corals can recover from mild bleaching, but scientists say those corals are more susceptible to disease. Severe bleaching can kill corals., Hughes said severe mass bleaching had never before hit the southern section of the reef – from Mackay south. That area had high numbers of heat-sensitive corals that “light up like a Christmas tree” when viewed from the air., “It’s not too late to turn this around with rapid action on emissions,” he said. “But business-as-usual emissions will make the the Great Barrier Reef a pretty miserable place compared to today.”,  In February the reef was subjected to its hottest sea surface temperatures since records began in 1900., Some scientists fear that rising levels of heat being taken up by the ocean have pushed tropical reefs to a tipping point at which many locations bleach almost annually., Wachenfeld said the reef’s sheer size – it comprises about 3,000 individual reefs – made it resilient, “but climate change brings a new scale of impact unlike anything we have seen before”., He told Guardian Australia: “Three mass bleaching events in five years is showing us the enormous scale at which climate change can operate., “No one climate event will kill the Great Barrier Reef, but each successive event creates more damage. Its resilience is not limitless and we need the strongest possible action on climate change.”, The globe has already warmed by about 1C above pre-industrial levels, caused primarily by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels., Wachenfeld said: “We’re at about 1C and we have just had three marine heatwaves in five years that have all damaged the reef.”, Measures to improve the resilience of the reef include improving water quality, controlling outbreaks of coral-eating starfish, and research and development to improve the heat tolerance of corals., “None of that is a substitute for strong action on emissions,” Wachenfeld said. “Dealing with the climate problem is the underpinning for everything else to work.”, Under the Paris climate agreement, countries agreed to deliver country-wide plans that would keep global heating well below 2C, with an aim to keep temperatures to 1.5C., “That’s the window we have to aim for,” Wachenfeld said., “As we approach and go beyond 2C, I don’t see the tools we have today, and the tools that research and development is working on, will protect the reef., “The world is heading for 3C of warming – we will not be able to protect coral reefs under those circumstances., “The reef is, after this event, a more damaged ecosystem, but it can still recover. It needs more help from us and it needs it urgently. This is a call to action.”, In a statement to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: “It is deeply concerning the reef has suffered another bleaching event and our focus has to be on the ways that we can reduce the pressure on the reef and strengthen its resilience., “The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been monitoring the situation closely and highlighting the concerns over temperatures., “Thankfully, some of the most recognised tourism areas have been less impacted but that does not change the importance of the issue and the importance of coordinated global action on emissions reduction to reduce ocean temperatures.”, Queensland’s minister for environment and the Great Barrier Reef, Leeanne Enoch, said climate change, pollution from run-off and other threats “are testing the reef’s ability to recover from major disturbances like mass bleaching events, severe tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish.”, She said the Palaszczuk government had “committed to a zero net emissions target by 2050” and allocated more than $427m for reef protection and resilience between 2015 and 2022., “The missing piece continues to be leadership and action from the federal government on climate change,” she said.great barrier reefs third mass bleaching in five years the most widespread ever", "label": 0}, "train-608": {"text": "\nNew renewable energy capacity hit record levels in 2019\n, Most new electricity globally was green and coronavirus bailouts must boost this further, says agency, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 11.41 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Apr 2020 12.05 EDT\n\n, Almost three-quarters of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 uses renewable energy, representing an all-time record. New data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) shows solar, wind and other green technologies now provide more than one-third of the world’s power, marking another record., Fossil fuel power plants are in decline in Europe and the US, with more decommissioned than built in 2019. But the number of coal and gas plants grew in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In the Middle East, which owns half the world’s oil reserves, just 26% of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 was renewable., The world has invested about $3tn in renewables over the past decade, according to Irena, but annual investments must double by 2030 to tackle the climate emergency., “While the trajectory is positive, more is required to put global energy on a path with sustainable development and climate mitigation,” said Francesco La Camera, director general of Irena. “At this challenging time, we are reminded of the importance of building resilience into our economies.”, La Camera said the huge spending planned by governments in response to the coronavirus pandemic must support green initiatives rather than fossil fuels. “In responding to today’s crisis, governments may be tempted to focus on short-term solutions,” he said. “Yet distinctions between short-, medium- and long-term challenges may be deceptive. The pandemic shows that delayed action brings significant economic consequences.”, The global oil market is in turmoil, hit by collapsing demand due to Covid-19 lockdowns and a savage price war between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. La Camera said: “Renewable energy is a cost-effective source of new power that insulates power markets and consumers from volatility.” Solar and wind power are now the cheapest form of electricity in two-thirds of the world., The Irena data shows the increase in new renewable energy capacity slowed slightly in 2019 - from 179GW to 176GW – but that new fossil fuel power also fell. The total green energy installed to date around the world grew by 7.6%, with the UK’s total rising 6.1%. The UK is now 11th in the world for installed renewables., New solar power provided 55% of the new capacity, most of which was installed in Asia, with China, India, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam leading the way. Other major increases were seen in the US, Australia, Spain, Germany and Ukraine., Wind power made up 34% of the total, with almost half in China and significant additions in the US. Global wind power capacity remains just ahead of solar, with 95% being onshore turbines., Other green technologies – hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and marine energy – all grew modestly year-on-year.

An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Americans are expected to die from Covid-19 complications, even if mitigation measures like good hygiene and social distancing are fully implemented., “This is an emergency and the priority is to stop the spread so this is a no brainer, everyone must have access to water … this should not be a partisan issue,” said congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, who is pushing federal intervention., In addition to the public health toll, the economic impact of the pandemic is already devastating families, with close to 10 millon people filing for unemployment benefits during the second half of March and an unprecedented spike in demand for emergency aid at food banks. One in two American adults have either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate’s 2019 Financial Security Index., Yet despite the evolving economic and health crises, less than 60% of the population have so far been protected from water shutoffs. And just 11% of these utilities have explicitly pledged to reconnect households currently without running water due to unpaid bills., “As unemployment reaches record highs, millions of Americans are going to have to choose between paying for food, rent and bills … water is not something people should have to tradeoff,” said Mary Grant, director of water at FWW., There is no national database tracking shutoffs or the number of US households left without running water. But in 2016, one in every 20 households were disconnected by public water departments, leaving an estimated 15 million Americans without running water., The highest shutoffs rates were concentrated in southern and rural states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida and Oklahoma. Some of the hardest-hit towns and cities including New Orleans, Detroit, Milwaukee, Mecklenburg, Ada and Dekalb are now Covid-19 hot-spots, according to analysis by the Guardian., In New Orleans, which has the fourth highest rate of coronavirus infection per capita in the country, only 300 households have so far been reconnected and the city does not know how many remain without running water., “It’s a package of related factors – institutional racism, environmental injustice, and poverty – which means communities most vulnerable to Covid-19 are the same communities most vulnerable to water shutoffs,” said Grant., So far, the moratoriums on shutoffs include 12 statewide orders, which apply to private and public water providers, issued by the governors of California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin., On Monday a coalition of community groups were set to call on New York governor Andrew Cuomo to issue a moratorium on price hikes, fines and shutoffs until 180 days after the end of the state of emergency., Currently, 8.5 million stateside New Yorkers still face the threat of disconnection if they fail to keep up with bills, while the number of households without running water is unknown. Shutoffs have been banned in New York City since before the pandemic, but in Buffalo for example, taps were turned off on 17,000 occasions between 2015 and March 2019. Buffalo has suspended shutoffs but is not reconnecting those without running water., Meanwhile, there are signs of some political will to tackle the issue in Washington., The House version of the third rescue package included $1.5bn to assist low income households with water bills during the crisis, and a condition which required localities and utilities to suspend utility shutoffs in order to qualify for financial aid., But the clauses were left out of the final bill approved by the senate on 26 March., Instead, congressional Democrats want $12bn for water subsidies in the fourth rescue package, with grants for utilities conditional on shutoff moratoriums. The National Association of Clean Water Agencies expects the pandemic to cost $12.5bn in lost revenue due to unpaid bills, debt forgiveness and restoring service., Last week, House speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled plans to propose $85bn for water projects in a subsequent forthcoming infrastructure bill to stimulate economic recovery., Almost 28 million people could lose their jobs by May, according to forecasting firm Oxford Economics – more than double the jobs cut during the 2007 to 2009 recession and its aftermath., Congresswoman Lawrence said: “Access to water has not been a priority in this country because it’s been a poor person’s issue ... now it’s a national concern and we have to transform our mindset.”millions us at risk losing running water amid layoffs triggered coronavirus pandemic", "label": 0}, "train-610": {"text": "\nCountry diary 1970: Teesdale's precious slopes of arctic flora\n, 10 April 1970 Soil conditions and a severe climate have produced a unique habitat for a host of delicate plants in the North Pennines, JT White, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 01.00 EDT\n\n, DURHAM: Leaving the hedgerowed landscapes far behind, the road finally rose beyond Langdon Beck and even the thin shelter of the stone dikes to the open, snowswept moorland.

With eyes closed, one might have mistaken the weight for the touch of falling raindrops., There, on my upturned hand, a robin – my friendly garden robin. Dark pupils watched me as it tucked in to the seed mix on my palm, picking sunflower kernels from the pile one at a time., It was in no hurry. In the past I have hand-fed robins that grab and dash, but this one steps forward to the centre of my palm and calmly eats its fill before heading off., Back in December this individual made itself known as I topped up the bird table, perching on the wooden slats almost as soon as I laid out dawn offerings. I felt sure I could forge a closer bond. By nature, robins shadow animals that disturb the soil and expose invertebrates – whether wild boar or gardeners – so are one of our most approachable birds., It took a fortnight to win its confidence. At first I rested my hand next to the seed as it fed on the table. Once it became used to this, I filled my palm with titbits, from which it snatched the odd morsel. Finally, the only food to be had was that which I held out – and following a few nervous flypasts, it plucked up courage and alighted., Now this bold little companion waits for me to come, and is on my hand and eating within seconds, its chest as bright as a segment of clementine, its back a warm brown., Although the sexes look alike and both sing through the winter, it is the males that become lead vocalists during the breeding season.

Rodents, bats and primates – which often live among people, and close to houses and farms – together were implicated as hosts for nearly 75% of all viruses. Bats alone have been linked to diseases like Sars, Nipah, Marburg and Ebola., The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that the spillover risk was highest from threatened and endangered wild animals whose populations had declined largely due to hunting, the wildlife trade and loss of habitat., “Human encroachment into biodiverse areas increases the risk of spillover of novel infectious diseases by enabling new contacts between humans and wildlife … We found that species in the primate and bat orders were significantly more likely to harbour zoonotic viruses compared to all other orders,” it said., “Spillover of viruses from animals are a direct result of our actions involving wildlife and their habitat,” said lead author Christine Kreuder Johnson, director of the EpiCenter for Disease Dynamics at the One Health Institute, a programme of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine., “The consequence is they’re sharing their viruses with us. These actions simultaneously threaten species survival and increase the risk of spillover. In an unfortunate convergence of many factors, this brings about the kind of mess we’re in now,” she said., “We need to be really attentive to how we interact with wildlife and the activities that bring humans and wildlife together. We obviously don’t want pandemics of this scale. We need to find ways to co-exist safely with wildlife, as they have no shortages of viruses to give us,” said Johnson., Separately, more than 200 of the world’s wildlife groups have written to the World Health Organization (WHO) calling on it to recommend to countries a highly precautionary approach to the multi-billion dollar wildlife trade, and a permanent ban on all live wildlife markets and the use of wildlife in traditional medicine., The Covid-19 pandemic, says the letter, is believed to have originated at wildlife markets in China, and to have been transmitted to humans as a result of the close proximity between wildlife and people., The groups, which include the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Zoological Society of London and Peta, say a ban on wildlife markets globally will help prevent the spread of disease, and address “one of the major drivers of species extinction”., “This decisive action, well within the WHO’s mandate, would be an impactful first step in adopting a highly precautionary approach to wildlife trade that poses a risk to human health,” says the letter., The organisations argue that zoonotic diseases are responsible for over 2 billion cases of human illness and over 2 million human deaths each year, including from Ebola, Mers, HIV, bovine tuberculosis, rabies, and leptospirosis., The letter follows acting UN biodiversity chief Elizabeth Maruma Mrema’s call in the Guardian this week for a global ban on wildlife markets., Unlike the conservation groups, Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, emphasised that millions of people, particularly in Africa, depend on wild animals for food and that alternatives to wet markets are needed., In a growing sign that global organisations are embarrassed by the emergence of zoonotic diseases in traded animals, Cites, the body which regulates the international trade of animals, refused to be drawn into the growing debate about the origins of Covid-19., In a terse statement it said: “Matters regarding zoonotic diseases are outside of Cites’s mandate and the Secretariat does not have the competence to make comments on the recent news on the possible links between human consumption of wild animals and Covid-19.”, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featureshuman impact on wildlife to blame for spread of viruses says study aoe", "label": 0}, "train-613": {"text": "\nSeal the deal: amorous mammals forced to contend with cruise ships\n, Harbour seals struggle to match volume of passing ships when trying to attract a mate, \nNicola Davis, \n\nTue 7 Apr 2020 19.01 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 8 Apr 2020 11.58 EDT\n\n, Cruise ships are drowning out the roars of seals that are important for bagging a mate, researchers have found in the latest study to reveal the consequences of human activity on wildlife., Ships are known to produce low-frequency sounds which can overlap with calls made by marine creatures. But now researchers studying harbour seals say such noise could be taking its toll., “As it gets noisier, it becomes harder for harbour seals to be heard,” said Dr Michelle Fournet, a co-author of the research at Cornell University, noting the animals’ roars serve a number of purposes – including advertising to females and establishing underwater territories., Writing in the journal Biology Letters, Fournet and colleagues report that they lowered an array of microphones into Glacier Bay in Alaska and recorded underwater sounds during May to October 2015. The team then analysed data from a nine-day period that overlapped with the peak breeding period for harbour seals., Among the sounds recorded were roars of male harbour seals, as well as the noise from other animals and passing shipping. “Vessels in general are one of the largest contributors to underwater sound in this area,” said Fournet., Overall, the team analysed recordings of 545 underwater roars, produced by at least four different male harbour seals., Fournet said widespread animals such as harbour seals are generally thought to be resilient to human activity., However the team found little, if any, difference in the loudness of roars made by the seals during noisy periods, when cruise ships were known to be passing, compared with those made during quiet periods when the ships were absent. The duration or frequency of the roars also showed no tangible difference. , Instead, the team found that the loudness of a roar beyond the rest of the soundscape fell by about 0.86 decibels for every one decibel increase in noise in the environment caused by the cruise ships. In other words, the area over which they could communicate shrank., “Because the harbour seals are already calling as loud as they can possibly call … as ocean noise gets louder, the ability to detect that signal goes down,” said Fournet, adding that the animals were likely calling loudly even during quiet periods as this would be advantageous both in bagging a mate and defending territory – but it meant they may not be able to turn up the volume when cruise ships show up., The team say the findings could potentially mean it is harder for males to find a mate, not least since the peak time for vessels including cruise ships overlaps with the animals’ breeding season. They add that more research is needed to see if this is indeed the case, noting that the passage of cruise ships in Glacier Bay is concentrated to just two periods of the day., Fournet added the coronavirus pandemic has opened up a new opportunities for research. “We are working right now on trying to get a hydrophone in the water so that we can listen during breeding season in the absence of ships for the first time,” she said., Dr Sarah Marley, an expert in the impact of noise on marine animals from the University of Portsmouth who was not involved in the study, said that noise from human activities has been increasing in the oceans – a trend that could change animals’ behaviour or mask sounds they make for important activities., But, she added, the new findings do not necessarily mean harbour seals have failed to adapt, noting that even quiet times in Glacier Bay may be noisier than locations without any shipping and hence require a louder roar., “It could be that the seals are already roaring at maximum levels during the so-called ‘quiet’ periods, and just can’t go any further to communicate during the really noisy periods,” she said., Marley added that the findings could have important ramifications for the UK, which has a population of about 43,000 harbour seals living in areas that, at least in part, overlap with those used by humans., “If man-made noise is impeding the breeding success of harbour seals, this could have important repercussions at the local and national level for seal management and conservation,” she said.seal the deal amorous mammals forced to contend with cruise ships", "label": 0}, "train-614": {"text": "\nBirdwatch: skylark's song lifts my spirits in these darkened times\n, On my daily walk I can enjoy hearing a bird whose song is the definitive sound of the countryside, \nStephen Moss, \n\nTue 7 Apr 2020 16.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 16.36 EDT\n\n, Our world is cribbed, confined and bound in as never before.

That it hasn’t been reported in most of Australia’s major news outlets doesn’t make that any less the case., Across nine days last month, Prof Terry Hughes from James Cook University travelled the length of the Great Barrier Reef in a small plane to survey the health of more than 1,000 individual sites. He was joined by an observer from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, a government agency., Hughes has been here before. It was his work in 2016 and 2017 that told us there had been back-to-back mass bleaching events that ultimately killed an estimated 49% of shallow water corals., His technique sounds uncomplicated, but it relies on sharp observational skills honed over decades. Reefs are filmed, assessed and scored. If 60% of coral on a reef has been drained of its colour it is considered severely bleached. Where possible, the assessments are checked and confirmed in the water., Hughes this week released maps that show 25% of reefs falling into this category, with another 35% having recorded modest bleaching. The marine park authority has confirmed it is the third mass bleaching event to hit the global landmark in just five years. It is the most widespread and second most severe episode of its type on record., Crucially, areas that previously escaped bleaching at the southern end, particularly those near or below Mackay, have been badly hit. The affected reefs include those around the Keppel group of islands, where Pauline Hanson was filmed diving in 2016 as she denied bleaching was a significant problem. Hughes says the coral there is now “snow white”., The impact of bleaching is now cumulative. Across the three events, in 2016 , 2017 and 2020, reefs along nearly the full length of the 2,300km natural wonder have been severely affected. Some of the staghorn corals in the south this year are expected to die in the months ahead, and turn a scuzzy brown as they are swamped by algae. Others will survive but be less resilient and aren’t likely to make it next time bleaching hits., Unprecedented is a word that gets thrown around so often now that it has lost meaning but it is a clear understatement when describing what has happened here., Look at it this way: when the Australian government last reported to the Unesco world heritage centre on the health of the reef back in 2015 – a moment that led to an extended diplomatic dance by the Coalition government to avoid it being labelled world heritage “in danger” – there had been only two mass bleaching events in observed history, and none since 2002., Since then, the reef has bleached more years than not. The two most recent events have been in both years when there was no El Niño, the climate cycle in the Pacific that inflates water temperatures., It suggests the underlying global heating is now at a level that an extended spell of warm weather is enough to leave the reef stricken. Next summer is considered a reasonable chance to bring another El Niño on top of that., Hughes took to Twitter on Tuesday to express his heartbreak at again seeing the natural monument he has dedicated his life to studying irrevocably hurt, and raise doubts whether he would make the trip again., I'm not sure I have the fortitude to do this again. It's heartbreaking to see the #GreatBarrierReef decline so fast. pic.twitter.com/LHgP5cIAQW, But the most striking commentary on the reef came from David Wachenfeld, the marine park authority’s chief scientist. It is rare for public officials to speak their minds in ways that may be uncomfortable for their elected overlords but, in an interview with my colleague Graham Readfearn, Wachenfeld set out the reef’s plight in clear, blunt language., He described the bleaching as a clear signal the reef was calling for urgent help, warned the resilience of the reef was not limitless and said it would require the “strongest action possible” on climate change to save it given the planet is headed for 3C heating – a level at which science tells us coral reefs can’t be protected. , That science was summarised by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which reported a majority of tropical coral reefs would disappear if heating was limited to 1.5C, and would be “at very high risk” at just 1.2C. The globe has already warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution., The government’s language did not match Wachenfeld’s urgency. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, acknowledged mass bleaching was “deeply concerning” and the importance of coordinated global action to cut emissions but said the focus had to be on programs to reduce the pressure on the reef and strengthen its resilience., It echoed Scott Morrison’s eventual response to the summer bushfires: conceding the role played by rising emissions but quickly emphasising adaptation over Australia doing more to tackle the problem at its source., There is another potential path, of course. Written down, it couldn’t sound simpler. It is true that Australia cannot address the climate crisis on its own but it is the world’s 14th biggest emitter and, as Morrison pointed out after he joined a G20 video conference to discuss coronavirus, can be influential in global debates., A growing number of analysts and policy experts, including ClimateWorks Australia and Ross Garnaut, have suggested in detail that the country could set a jobs-friendly and economically sound course to net-zero emissions. The stimulus program that will be needed to recover from the pandemic offers a one-shot opportunity to speed up a clean transition., This combination of action at home combined with a new diplomatic effort would give Australia the best chance at saving the reef. At a minimum, Australia’s new role as a climate hawk would point to a future in which the country embraced what will be an inevitable shift to a low-emissions world, rather than be dragged to it.

The research, done in the US, calculates that slightly cleaner air in Manhattan in the past could have saved hundreds of lives., Given the large differences in toxic air levels across countries, the research suggests people in polluted areas are far more likely to die from the coronavirus than those living in cleaner areas. The scientists said dirty air was already known to increase the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is extremely deadly and a cause of Covid-19-related deaths, as well as other respiratory and heart problems., A separate report from scientists in Italy notes that the high death rates seen in the north of the country correlate with the highest levels of air pollution., The scientists said their findings could be used to ensure that areas with high levels of air pollution take extra precautions to slow the spread of the virus and deploy extra resources to deal with the outbreak. Air pollution has already fallen because of widespread lockdowns, but the scientists said ensuring cleaner air in the future would help reduce Covid-19 deaths., The study, by researchers at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston,analysed air pollution and Covid-19 deaths up to 4 April in 3,000 US counties, covering 98% of the population. “We found that an increase of only 1μg/m3 in PM2.5 particles is associated with a 15% increase in the Covid-19 death rate,” the team concluded., A small increase in exposure to particle pollution over 15-20 years was already known to increase the risk of death from all causes, but the new work shows this increase is 20 times higher for Covid-19 deaths., “The results are statistically significant and robust,” they said. The study took account of a range of factors, including poverty levels, smoking, obesity, and the number of Covid-19 tests and hospital beds available. They also assessed the effect of removing from the analysis both New York City, which has had many cases, and counties with fewer than 10 confirmed Covid-19 cases., “Previous work showed that air pollution exposure dramatically increased the risk of death from the Sars coronavirus during the 2003 outbreak,” said Rachel Nethery, one of the Harvard team. “So we think our results here are consistent with those findings.”, Xiao Wu, a fellow team member, said: “This information can help us prepare by encouraging populations with high pollution exposure to take extra precautions and allocate extra resources to reduce the risk of poor outcomes from Covid-19. It is likely that Covid-19 will be a part of our lives for quite a long time, despite our hope for a vaccine or treatment. In light of this, we should consider additional measures to protect ourselves from pollution exposure to reduce the Covid-19 death toll.”, The authors said the results highlighted the need to keep enforcing existing air pollution regulations, and that failure to do so could potentially increase the Covid-19 death toll. They noted that the US Environmental Protection Agency suspended its enforcement of environmental laws on 26 March., The study is being fast-tracked for publication in a major medical journal., Prof JonathanGrigg, from Queen Mary University of London, said the study was methodologically sound and plausible, but had some limitations, for example, important factors such as smoking were not measured at the individual level., “Clearly, we urgently need more studies, since locally generated particle pollution will bounce back once the lockdown is eased,” he said., The US has the third highest death toll to date, after Italy and Spain. A second study focusing on Italy, published in the journal Environmental Pollution, said: “We conclude that the high level of pollution in northern Italy should be considered an additional co-factor of the high level of lethality recorded in that area.”, It noted that northern Italy was one of Europe’s most polluted areas and that the death rate reported up to 21 March in the northern Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna regions was about 12%, compared with 4.5% in the rest of Italy., “It is well known that pollution impairs the first line of defence of upper airways, namely cilia, thus a subject living in an area with high levels of pollutant is more prone to develop chronic respiratory conditions and is more vulnerable to any infective agent,” it said., Medical scientists warned in mid-March that air pollution exposure could make Covid-19 worse. Early research on Covid-19 had suggested that the weakened lungs of smokers and former smokers made them more susceptible to the virus., While lockdowns have caused air pollution to fall dramatically, a comprehensive global review published in 2019 found that over long periods air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body., • This article was amended on 8 April 2020 to correct a misspelling of the surname of Jonathan Grigg.air pollution linked to far higher covid 19 death rates study finds", "label": 0}, "train-617": {"text": "\nVolcanic activity helped trigger Triassic climate change, study says\n, Research offers ‘a sobering warning’ on the impact of today’s climate emergency, \nNicola Davis, \n\nTue 7 Apr 2020 11.21 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 12.12 EDT\n\n, Volcanic eruptions played an important and direct role in triggering the extreme climate that killed off swathes of life at the end of the Triassic period 201m years ago, researchers have found., Experts say they have discovered bubbles of carbon dioxide trapped in volcanic rocks dating to the end of the Triassic, backing up the theory that such activity contributed to the greenhouse climate that is believed to have been behind the mass extinction., “This biotic crisis wiped out almost half of the existing species of the late Triassic in both marine and terrestrial realms,” said Manfredo Capriolo of the University of Padova in Italy, a co-author of the study., While Capriolo noted the end-Triassic mass extinction has long been known to have been caused by extreme climate change, and that there was large-scale volcanic activity at the time, he said it had been unclear whether the volcanic activity directly contributed to the extinction event. Among other possibilities, he said, it could have been that magma caused the emission of gases as it flowed into shallow sediments.,  The new work, said Capriolo, shows that carbon dioxide released directly by volcanic activity would indeed have made a large contribution to the devastating climate change of the time., Indeed the team say the amount of carbon emissions released in a single pulse of eruptions – which would have resulted in about 100,000 km3 of lava being spewed forth over 500 years – is on a par with the total expected to be produced by human activity over the 21st century, assuming a 2C rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels., That, they say, offers a sobering warning for today. “This suggests that the end-Triassic climatic and environmental changes, driven by CO2 emissions, may have been similar to those predicted for the near future,” the team write., Capriolo stressed the similarity in CO2 levels was striking. “The end-Triassic world and the modern one are very different, as well as the origin of the greenhouse gas emissions, but we, as geoscientists, announce this alarming comparison,” he said., Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Capriolo and colleagues report how they studied more than 200 samples of rock from North America, Morocco and Portugal. These were deposited towards the end of the Triassic, in volcanic activity that contributed to the breakup of the Pangea supercontinent and the opening up of the central Atlantic Ocean, with the rocks creating what is known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province – a vast expanse covering an area about a third of the size the moon., The team found around 10% of the samples showed the presences of bubbles within small blobs of magma trapped by crystals in the rocks, most of which were found to contain carbon dioxide. Further analysis, they say, suggests the gas probably became entrapped deep within the Earth’s crust, suggesting it originated in the lower-middle crust or in the mantle., From these findings the team were able to calculate the concentration of carbon dioxide that would have been present in the magma of the volcanic eruptions, revealing that up to 100,000 Gt of carbon dioxide would have been released in total as the volcanic rocks were laid down., Dr Jessica Whiteside, associate professor of geochemistry at the University of Southampton who was not involved in the work, said the role of volcanic activity in the end-Triassic mass extinction had been a matter of much debate. “Over the past 30 years, the question as to whether widespread volcanic eruptions trigger climatic effects severe enough to result in extinction has waxed and waned, from most certainly no to most certainly yes,” she said. , The new study, she said, added weight to the latter view. “The study reports new evidence that is the most conclusive that has been produced for CO2 being emitted directly from individual lava eruptions relating to the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province,” she said, adding that the report reveals pulses of the eruptions spewed out amounts on a par to those produced by human activities, with devastating effects., That, Whiteside added, provided lessons for today. “The initiation of these eruptions created one of the warmest climate since the dawn of animal life on our planet, and coincided with massive extinction on land and in the oceans,” she said.volcanic activity triggered triassic climate change", "label": 0}, "train-618": {"text": "\nRecord-size hole opens in ozone layer above the Arctic\n, Rare hole is result of low temperatures in atmosphere and is expected to disappear , \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nTue 7 Apr 2020 11.20 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 17.23 EDT\n\n, A rare hole has opened up in the ozone layer above the Arctic, in what scientists say is the result of unusually low temperatures in the atmosphere above the north pole., The hole, which has been tracked from space and the ground over the past few days, has reached record dimensions, but is not expected to pose any danger to humans unless it moves further south. If it extends further south over populated areas, such as southern Greenland, people would be at increased risk of sunburn. However, on current trends the hole is expected to disappear altogether in a few weeks., Low temperatures in the northern polar regions led to an unusual stable polar vortex, and the presence of ozone-destroying chemicals such as chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere – from human activities – caused the hole to form., “The hole is principally a geophysical curiosity,” said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. “We monitored unusual dynamic conditions, which drive the process of chemical depletion of ozone. Those dynamics allowed for lower temperatures and a more stable vortex than usual over the Arctic, which then triggered the formation of polar stratospheric clouds and the catalytic destruction of ozone.”, The hole is not related to the Covid-19 shutdowns that have drastically cut air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. It is also too early to say whether the unusually stable Arctic polar vortex conditions are linked with the climate crisis, or part of normal stratospheric weather variability., Peuch said there were no direct implications for the climate crisis. Temperatures in the region are already increasing, slowing the depletion of ozone, and the hole will start to recede as polar air mixes with ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. The last time similar conditions were observed was in spring 2011., The hole was tracked by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, based partly in Reading and funded by the European commission., While a hole over the Arctic is a rare event, the much larger hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic has been a major cause for concern for more than four decades. The production of ozone-depleting chemicals has been drastically reduced, under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, but some sources appear still to be functioning – in 2018, unauthorised emissions were detected from eastern China., The Antarctic ozone hole was the smallest in 35 years last November, showing the success of efforts to cut the production of the harmful pollutants. The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun., New sources of ozone-depleting chemicals were not a factor in the hole observed in the Arctic, said Peuch. “However, this is a reminder that one should not take the Montreal Protocol measures for granted, and that observations from the ground and from satellites are pivotal to avoid a situation where the chlorine and bromine levels in the stratosphere could increase again.”record size hole opens in ozone layer above the arctic", "label": 0}, "train-619": {"text": "\n'Please don't come': calls to close US national parks over virus fears\n, More than half the National Park Service’s unit remain open but local police and health officials are urging people to stay away, Annette McGivney in Flagstaff, Arizona, \n\nTue 7 Apr 2020 09.54 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 12.37 EDT\n\n, As mild temperatures and spring blooms emerged in southern Utah this past weekend, so did the tourists. At Capitol Reef national park, the trailhead parking lot was full of cars bearing plates from states such as California, Washington, Colorado and Georgia, all Covid-19 hotspots. The hikers were either oblivious to or ignoring the plea from the local sheriff’s office that outsiders stay away., “While we would normally welcome visitors to enjoy the beauty of Wayne county, we really don’t want visitors during the Covid-19 pandemic,” stated a 3 April post on the sheriff’s Facebook page. Wayne county, where Capitol Reef is located, has 2,600 residents and little in the way of healthcare services. “If you don’t live here, please don’t come here.” , The crown jewels in the US national park system, like Grand Canyon and Zion, were shuttered last week after days of petitioning from local health authorities, but 284 of the 419 units in the national park system remain fully or partially open to visitors., They are parks such as Capitol Reef, renowned for a colorful series of sandstone cliffs. Even after the main scenic drive was closed on Sunday to try to discourage visitors, the park itself remained open., The National Park Service (NPS) “asks visitors to follow CDC guidance as well as state and local orders in order to protect themselves and others”, said Chelsea Sullivan, a public affairs specialist at NPS headquarters in Washington DC. Sullivan said there are no immediate plans for an agency-wide shut down. “Where it is possible to adhere to federal, state and local public health guidance, outdoor spaces will remain accessible to the public.” , But many NPS employees on the frontlines disagree with the agency’s approach. “It is irresponsible for us to be open because we are aiding in the spread of the virus,” said a manager at a national park in the midwest who has witnessed visitation increase over the past several weeks., Last Friday, the park hosted visitors from as far away as New York and Florida, including a man who said he was visiting every national park after being laid off from his job. Even as governors from 42 states have issued stay-at-home orders, the park manager, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, pointed out that the National Park Service is encouraging vacation-type travel., “Something bigger is going on, people are on the move,” said the manager. “More than half of our visitors are from outside the region and that is not typical for us.”, According to information provided to the Guardian, superintendents at numerous parks that are experiencing rises in visitation are seeking permission to close completely. However, getting approval from the Department of Interior to shut down requires that state and county health authorities petition the interior secretary and make the case that the park poses a public health threat., In the absence of this approval, superintendents have implemented piecemeal facility closures to try to protect staff from exposure to coronavirus, such as shutting visitor centers and closing roads. But rangers, first responders and maintenance employees are still on the job and interacting with visitors., “We are seeing increased visitation right now, especially on weekends,” said a ranger working at Minuteman national historical park in Concord, Massachusetts. The ranger noted that buildings in the 970-acre park were closed but the trails were open. “We are trying to be a refuge for people.” According to data from the New York Times, there were more than 2,600 coronavirus cases in Middlesex county, where the park is located., For the millions of Americans who are feeling chained to their houses, getting outdoors is often the brightest part of the day. But national parks are designed to concentrate people on to developed trails to protect the environment, and this makes following current CDC guidelines for social distancing tough., “I wish we could find refuge in national parks right now but in many cases the parks are too crowded to be safe,” said Phil Francis, chair of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, which represents more than 1,800 current and retired NPS employees. “It’s just not possible to keep people far enough apart on the trails. If CDC guidelines aren’t being followed then the parks need to be closed.”, In addition to hazards posed to park staff and locals in communities where parks are located, the cross-country travel that national park visitation encourages poses its own threat. “People want to drive out to where it’s beautiful,” said Steve Howe, a canyoneering guide living near Capitol Reef, “but they are visiting all the services en route and transmitting disease from areas of high urban density to rural areas every time they stop for gas or at a convenience store. Even though there are no Covid-19 cases here right now, I expect there will be soon from the spillover effect of people passing through.”, Griffin’s, the only grocery store in the southern Utah town of Escalante, implemented restrictions beginning on Sunday that limit store entry to residents. Escalante is located on a popular scenic byway between Capitol Reef and Bryce Canyon national park, which is also open. , Howe, who owns a small guiding company and has seen his business evaporate with the spread of Covid-19, was glad Capitol Reef closed its main road but is skeptical people will stay home., “When America thinks of going out into nature, they think of going to parks,” he said. “I am not looking forward to the Easter weekend madness.”us national parks coronavirus close open", "label": 0}, "train-620": {"text": "\nIndustrial-sized pig and chicken farming continuing to rise in UK\n, \nIndustrial-sized pig and chicken farming continuing to rise in UK\n, Number of large-scale, intensive farms with upwards of 40,000 birds or 2,000 pigs is increasing, driven by demand for cheap meat, Claire Colley and \nAndrew Wasley, \n\nTue 7 Apr 2020 09.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 10.11 EDT\n\n, New figures reveal that the number of large industrial-sized pig and chicken farms in the UK continues to rise, with close to 2,000 across the country., In 2017, the then environment secretary Michael Gove told MPs: “One thing is clear: I do not want to see, and we will not have, US-style farming in this country.” However, the number of industrial-sized pig and poultry units in the UK has risen by 7% from 1,669 in 2017 to 1,786 this year., Chicken farms are classed as “intensive” if they have capacity to house at least 40,000 poultry birds, while pig farms must have 2,000 pigs raised for meat or 750 breeding sows. Intensive pig and poultry facilities require a permit from the Environment Agency to operate, which is not the case at present for intensive beef and dairy units, so their numbers are not monitored.In England alone, according to 2020 data obtained by the Guardian and Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the number of permitted intensive livestock facilities in England has risen 7% since 2017 to 1,313 as of February this year. Of these, 1,092 are poultry and 221 are pig units, up from 1,016 and 210 respectively. Scotland has seen a rise of 10% and Wales has seen the highest rise, up 21% since 2017. Northern Ireland’s figures have not shown any increase.There is concern that Brexit and new trade deals might further fuel intensification if farmers are forced to stay competitive in the face of cheap, low-welfare imports. At present, the new agriculture bill offers no legal guarantees to prevent this., Driven in part by supermarket pressure to keep prices low and consumer demand for cheap meat, the growth of industrial farming remains divisive.Intensive pig and poultry farms have been linked to local biodiversity damage from ammonia emissions and to detrimental impacts on local communities including noise pollution, increased traffic, and potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and air pollutants. It is also seen as a driver of deforestation in South America, through its reliance on protein-rich crops such as soya as animal feed., A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The UK has some of the highest animal welfare and environmental standards in the world. This means all livestock farms, regardless of their size or scale, must meet our high standards and comply with robust legislation.”However, animal welfare charities say 70% of UK farm animals, more than 1 billion animals every year, are now kept in intensive indoor units that Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion in World Farming calls “the biggest cause of animal cruelty in Britain today”., Chicken is our most popular meat, with 20 million birds slaughtered every week in the UK. The vast majority (86%) of industrial-sized farms are in the poultry sector, with 1,534 industrial-sized farms. Previous research from 2017 found seven out of the 10 largest farms in the UK housed more than 1 million birds., But large-scale and intensive methods of farming poultry with high stocking densities and fast-growing breeds have been linked to poor animal welfare. Chickens are bred to grow four times faster than in the 1950s – taking  35–45 days to reach a target slaughter weight of 2–2.5kgs. Almost one-third of intensively reared broiler chickens in the UK develop heart and lung problems. And more than half of the birds in flocks with fast-growing breeds have severe walking problems, with many suffering from lesions on their feet through sitting in their own waste. , The intensification of the poultry sector has also generated local conflict with units often built in regional clusters surrounding slaughterhouses and factories. The Cluck Off campaign in Rushden, Northamptonshire, is fighting Bedfordia’s proposal for a six-shed unit for 314,000 birds, while in Horham and Southolt, Suffolk, locals are trying to stop Epigs Ltd’s plans for 12 poultry houses producing 800,000 chickens every eight weeks., The National Farmers’ Union says farm size is not the critical factor in dictating the welfare of birds. “It is crucial we recognise that animal husbandry and stockmanship are the greatest factors that determine animal health and welfare, not farm size or system of production,” said its chief poultry adviser, Gary Ford.,  While outdoor production accounts for 40% of the UK pig industry, the majority of UK pig farming is now intensive with 60% of sows and almost all fattening pigs kept indoors in concrete or slatted floor pens – entitled to one square  metre of space each.In the pig sector, there are 252 industrial indoor units in the UK, up 5% since 2017. Previous research from 2017 found the largest then could hold 23,000 pigs., Abnormal behaviour such as tail biting is common  in intensive pig units but can be reduced by providing adequate enrichment such as straw. However, more than 70% of pigs in the UK have their tails cut off to mitigate tail biting and stress aggression., Around 60% of sows give birth while confined in a farrowing crate. The government recently rejected attempts to outlaw the use of farrowing crates despite their adverse impact on sow welfare, inducing repetitive stress behaviours such as bar biting., The National Pig Association states that the production system doesn’t dictate animal welfare and it’s the treatment of individual animals that is important. A spokesperson said: “The primary purpose of the farrowing crate is to prevent the sow from rolling on and crushing her piglets (due to the sow being about 150 times the size of the piglets). The crate also enables stockpersons to work easily and safely around the sow and her piglets, during a time when sows can be particularly aggressive.”, Philip Lymbery of Compassion in World Farming hopes that Brexit will lead to a new policy direction, supported by political and public pressure: “We’re at a crossroads and have an opportunity to reinvent British food and farming. We can move towards a thriving countryside where farm animals are restored to the land.”industrial sized pig and chicken farming continuing to rise in uk", "label": 0}, "train-621": {"text": "\nLife in the 'poultry capital' of Wales: enough is enough, say overwhelmed residents\n, Powys now has more than 100 large-scale intensive chicken farms, with 60 times as many chickens as people in the county, Claire Colley, \n\nTue 7 Apr 2020 09.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 13 Apr 2020 04.50 EDT\n\n, Darrell Shephard and his family had been living in Berriew, a small village in rural Powys, for 12 years when the owners of Groes-y-Garreg farm, just up the road, put in a planning application to be allowed to raise 100,000 chickens., “There are 14 family homes within 500 metres, and ours is 300 metres from the farm, which is traditionally a dairy,” Shephard told the Guardian. “I understand why many farmers need to diversify, but I had no idea about intensive chicken farming until it came to my doorstep. This isn’t farming, it’s a large, busy 24/7 automated factory.”, The county of Powys runs from the Brecon Beacons up to brooding Snowdonia. But these days, with an almost 100% increase in intensive farming since 2011, it is known as the “poultry capital of Wales”. There are now 116 intensive poultry units (IPUs) in the county, each raising more than 40,000 birds. With an estimated 8.5 million chickens on permitted units in Powys, that is 64 times more chickens than people. Large-scale intensive pig and poultry facilities require a permit from the Environment Agency to operate. In Wales these are issued by Natural Resources Wales (NRW). Of the 36 permits issued since 2017, 29 (81%) have been in Powys and concerned residents are campaigning to stop them., “We moved here for a peaceful rural lifestyle,” says Shephard. “But if this chicken factory gets built it will be no different to living in an industrial area. Our narrow village roads are totally unsuitable and the noise will keep us awake. Other people near these complain of unbearable smells and fly swarms too.” The Guardian was unable to reach the owners of Groes-y-Garreg farm for comment. The company who made the application for the farm had no comment to make.The residents of Berriew are not the only ones opposing IPUs in Powys – others include the Llanerchydol residents who are resisting plans for a “mega farm” unit for 15,000 birds at Frochas, and residents near Llangadfan who are trying to stop a 120,000-chicken facility., Supporters of intensive farming say the developments create much-needed diversification for farmers, as well as employment and support for the local economy. US poultry conglomerate Avara Foods recently invested in two new chicken-rearing units in Powys.The National Farmers’ Union says uncertainty over farming subsidies post-Brexit and increased demand has seen farmers diversify, to poultry especially. Its chief poultry adviser, Gary Ford, says: “This is an attractive industry for both existing farmers and new entrants to move into.”, But Jill Kibble from the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales says farmers have also been targeted by aggressive marketing campaigns with agents literally knocking on doors: “Some are actively persuading farmers into applying for intensive units regardless of the availability of an appropriate site.”, But it is not just regulated farms causing the problems. At present, only pig and poultry facilities housing more than 2,000 pigs, 750 breeding sows or 40,000 birds require an environmental impact assessment from NRW. The problem for the Powys community, however, is that the region has also seen the growth of unregulated poultry farms, producing broilers and free-range eggs. Such units only require planning permission., “Small villages are being ringed with units,” says Kibble. “Llanwnog has five, with another in planning and Llanfair Caereinion and Meifod have numerous units too. It’s essential that all potential impacts are looked at in combination and determinations made on the basis of independent expert analysis.”, Intensive poultry operations have been linked to local biodiversity damage from ammonia emissions. Simon Bareham, principal air quality adviser at NRW, says: “The rise of IPUs in the region is totally unprecedented and in areas like Powys, we know the ammonia is coming from poultry – its levels have reverted to those in 1990. The rapid expansion of the poultry industry poses the greatest short-term threat to biodiversity in Wales that I have experienced in over 30 years.” , Meanwhile a 2017 report by the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences says that residents and farmers near intensive units are at increased risk of harmful bacteria, infectious diseases, viruses and air pollutants: “The current situation in densely populated livestock farming areas could be regarded as a ‘natural experiment’”, it concluded., The greatest short-term threat to biodiversity in Wales that I have experienced in over 30 years, In 2018, the Welsh government told local planning authorities to exercise particular care when considering developments that would bring livestock units within close proximity to homes, schools and hospitals. It recently set up an  intensive  agriculture  working  group to advise on development policies. A Welsh government spokesperson said: “We want to promote sustainable agriculture across Wales and we are looking at how local planning authorities plan for new intensive farming developments. We will issue further guidance on intensive farming later this year.”, Powys county council says that cumulative impacts are now being taken into account when determining planning applications., A spokesperson said: “The planning application currently remains pending and the local planning authority is working with the evidence provided in conjunction with its consultees towards making an informed decision in line with planning policy and guidance. The planning process allows members of the public to view the information submitted in support of the application and to make comments. Such comments are also taken into account in the decision making process in so far as they are relevant and material.”, However, Russell George, the Welsh assembly member for Montgomeryshire, says communities have yet to witness any change – of the two environmental permits issued to IPUs this year, both are near other poultry units, and a Powys county council planning meeting heard in February that the authority is not currently monitoring the numbers of IPUs in the region, and has given planning permission for a new 100,000-broiler unit at Lower Trederwen farm., Bareham says: “Someone in the planning system has to ask when is enough enough? How many poultry units are we going to have in Powys?”, For Darrell Shephard and the residents of Berriew, any changes may be too late: “If I wanted to build a factory in the same location, the same size, pumping out pollution, it would be laughed out of planning. We can only hope that Powys planning is becoming more informed about the negative impacts of IPUs. If this factory gets planning permission it will benefit one local family while causing misery to many others.”life in the poultry capital of wales enough is enough say overwhelmed residents", "label": 0}, "train-622": {"text": "\nGetty Images Climate Visuals photography grant winners\n, Getty Images Climate Visuals photography grant winners, Narratives from 144 grant applicants in more than 40 countries provided a unique insight into the reality of climate change.

They see the land becoming more saturated beneath their feet. Thirteen of the bay’s southern islands, many of them once inhabited, are gone., 3 Millimeters explores the waterways of Maryland, where, due to the region’s makeup and Atlantic Ocean flow, sea levels are rising twice as fast as the global average and will leap by as much as 5ft by 2100.

Gradient sea walls, vegetation renourishment and public education are all trying to preserve natural habitat and homes along the coast. The hope is that it will stop erosion as well as maintain habitat for sealife such as horseshoe crabs and terrapins. getty images climate visuals photography grant winners", "label": 0}, "train-623": {"text": "\nCountry diary: singing stonechat gives after-hours performance\n, Buxton, Derbyshire: From across dark moorland, the bird poured out his tiny heart in a moving moment, \nMark Cocker, \n\nTue 7 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, I was coming down off the moorland tops and the curved outlines of the near slopes were already immersed in darkness. Suddenly out of a featureless middle distance came the unexpected song of a stonechat., It is not a well-known vocalisation, although the species itself has expanded both here and in lowland England. Stonechats (Saxicola rubicola) love open country – coastal dunes, heath or gorse-sprinkled places – where the males are familiar to many., She may be brown and inconspicuous, but his head is coal-black encircled with a linen-white half-collar and across the upper bib is the most delightful evening orange. In truth, even he has a nervous, fidgety manner, as if faintly embarrassed by so much conspicuous colour. The song is comparably unassuming and rather frail – a brief scatter of bright glasslike notes that seldom carry far – but this night it sounded much clearer., We often overlook how much diurnal birds will vocalise in darkness. Curlews and skylarks routinely fly and sing after sunset. Sedge and reed warblers will keep up the crazy free-form bebop rhythm of their mimicry-laced songs at night and it was once well known how corncrakes could sustain a single-sound file-rasping crex note on and on even until dawn., Snipe will deliver an airborne sound, known as drumming, in which they fly repeatedly down to drive air through outer pinnate tail feathers, to produce a weird vibratory juddering effect that, in the absence of visual cues, is felt as much as heard. And perhaps most beautiful of all, if we ignore the dark’s most famous songster, is the odd night-owl blackbird who can roll out a strangely disembodied version of his customary hymn to late-morning., I cherish these various kinds of after-hours avian music, and even more for their context. But this was the first time that I had ever heard a stonechat sing at night. Standing there, faced towards the western sky with a gibbous moon in its ice-blue lower third and the faintest lemon band of light still lying at the Earth’s rim, I found this cock stonechat pouring out his tiny heart somewhere on that blank moor perhaps the most moving moment of all.country diary singing stonechat gives after hours performance", "label": 0}, "train-624": {"text": "\nQueensland parks and wildlife officer dies after being bitten by a shark at Great Barrier Reef\n, The 23-year-old man sustained injuries to his hand, leg and elbow in a ‘horrific’ attack, Australian Associated Press, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 20.08 EDT\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 6 Apr 2020 16.31 EDT\n\n, A shark has killed a Queensland parks and wildlife officer during a work trip at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef., The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has paid tribute to the 23-year-old, who died in hospital on Monday night a few hours after he was mauled near North West Island., “My understanding is he was employed by the Queensland parks and wildlife service,” the premier told reporters on Tuesday., “Once again a family out there is grieving for a young man who tragically has lost his life in this horrific shark attack.

It is transmitted directly between animals or through infected meat or animal feed and has also been seen as having the potential to transmit to humans. There is an ongoing outbreak in China that has already already wiped out 40% of pigs in the country., The outbreak is Poland’s second in 2020 and the first in the Poznań region, an important centre of pig farming., The source of the infection were ASF-positive piglets that the farm owner, Smithfield Foods’ subsidiary Agri Plus, purchased in mid-March., The farm in Więckowice specialises in fattening piglets up to 30kg. There are just over 10,000 piglets on the farm that will have to be culled, local authorities said, but the eradication of the outbreak might be slowed by safety and social distancing measures imposed in Poland in order to stop the spread of Covid-19., The spread of ASF on pig farms and in wild boars in western Poland is a concern for Germany, Europe’s top pork producer with approximately 26 million pigs. Germany is also the EU’s second largest pork exporter to non-EU markets, after Spain. Most German exports go to China, South Korea and Japan. Should any of those markets – China in particular – classify Germany as an ASF country, it could herald a major crisis for the German pork industry., That would also spell trouble for Polish pork producers: a Chinese ban on German pork could lead to it flooding the EU market, depressing prices., But ASF on pig farms is just one source of potential problems for German pork producers. Another – and more serious – is wild boars, over which there is much less control. There have been more than 1,600 ASF cases in wild boars in 2020 in Poland to date, only 600 fewer than in the whole of 2019, according to data from the General Veterinary Inspectorate., Poland passed a special law on containing ASF in December last year that gave Polish hunting associations new powers in culling wild boar., But the hunting associations are regularly accused of disregarding safety measures and helping, rather than curbing, the spread of the disease. In early 2020, private broadcaster TVN24 allegedly exposed the lax biosecurity measures of one of the hunting associations, prompting a criminal investigation.The German states of Brandenburg and Saxony have both recently built fences along the border with Poland to prevent wild boars from entering., “Jumps over large distances in the disease spread (eg within Poland, to Belgium, Hungary, the Czech Republic) clearly show the existing risk of introduction into Germany through human activity. The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) is especially concerned about the situation in wild boar in Poland as the last cases are only about 10km from the German border,” said Elke Reinking, a spokesperson for FLI, Germany’s federal research institute for animal health., About 10 European countries are currently suffering from ASF, the most recent being Greece, where the first case was recorded in early February in the region of Serres, close to Bulgaria and North Macedonia., In China, authorities have launched a 60-day campaign until 1 June to crack down on improper or illegal transportation of pigs to reduce ASF transmission. An unnamed ministry of agriculture official said last week that China has had no widespread ASF outbreaks in the first three months of the year, though there have been eight local outbreaks leading to the death of 738 pigs. Two recent cases occurred in Gansu province in north-central China in March and early April where trucks illegally transporting piglets to other provinces were detected at toll booths. In one case authorities said that 67 out of 110 piglets died of the illness. A similar incident happened in Chongqing, a major municipality in central China in which 67 out of 298 piglets illegally brought into the area died, according to an 5 April report from state-run media. The reports did not say if the surviving pigs were culled., Some areas are also stepping up measures for containing ASF by requiring larger-scale slaughtering operations alongside an overall push for bigger, more centralised farms. Hebei province, which surrounds the capital Beijing, announced on 7 April that it will now forbid pig slaughtering facilities with capacities of less than 150,000 pigs per year., The agriculture ministry stated in late March that “incidence of African swine flu was significantly lower” over the first three months of 2020 compared to the same period a year before, with only 324 pigs officially culled in that period., Others who have followed the outbreak closely are less optimistic that China has a handle on the outbreak. “China is still having very, very serious problems with African swine fever and the government has done absolutely nothing that has been effective,” said Wayne Johnson, a veterinarian at farm services company Enable Agricultural Technology Consulting, who is based in Beijing. “They could have stopped it early but they did nothing,” said Johnson. “They even forbade people to test for it. There are pigs going to the slaughterhouse every day with ASF. They don’t clean the trucks. The local governments refused to diagnose it as African swine fever, because if they did, they would have to pay an indemnity since the law is that they now have to pay if the farm has ASF.”african swine fever outbreak reported in western poland", "label": 0}, "train-627": {"text": "\nWildlife destruction 'not a slippery slope but a series of cliff edges'\n, New study finds ocean ecosystems likely to collapse in 2020s and land species in 2040s unless global warming stemmed, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nWed 8 Apr 2020 11.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 8 Apr 2020 13.02 EDT\n\n, Wildlife species will die out and natural ecosystems collapse in the near future if the climate crisis goes unchecked, scientists have warned, as new research shows that the natural world is at far greater risk from climate breakdown than previously thought., Catastrophe could strike this decade for some species, as key temperature thresholds are crossed. Instead of the anticipated gradual decline of species, there are likely to be a series of sudden collapses., Ocean ecosystems will be first hit, as the seas have already warmed to an unprecedented extent, and problems such as lack of oxygen and an increase in acid worsen., By the 2040s, a similarly abrupt collapse is likely to spread to the land, causing devastation among key species in Indonesia, the Amazon, India, northern Australia and sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo rainforest., “It’s not a slippery slope, but a series of cliff edges, hitting different places at different times,” said Alex Pigot of University College London, lead author of the study, published today in the journal Nature., What appears to happen, according to the study’s authors, is that most species can cope with warming temperatures for a while. But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse., The authors base their projections on dividing the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005., Then they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed.,  Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/04/08/melting-glacier--trimmed.mp3 , “Despite many hundreds of studies looking at the impacts on biodiversity of climate change, this abrupt pattern of collapse hasn’t previously been detected, because most studies have focused on projections for one – or a few – snapshots of the future, say the year 2070 or 2100,” Pigot explained., “In our study, we instead quantified how the risks to biodiversity from climate change will change over time at annual resolutions.”, The scientists found that, on average, 73% of the species facing unprecedented temperatures before 2100 will cross that threshold simultaneously. If global temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, as they will if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, then at least 15% of ecosystems will have an “abrupt exposure event”, meaning more than one fifth of their constituent species will cross the threshold in the same decade, causing irreversible damage., But at less than 2C of warming, the limit set under the Paris agreement, only 2% of ecosystems will go through such abrupt change, sparing many of the species at risk from higher temperatures., That means taking urgent action on emissions could save tens of thousands of species by “flattening the curve” of the impact, and providing more time for species and ecosystems to adapt., “It is not too late to stop extinctions from climate change,” said Christopher Trisos, of the University of Cape Town, co-author of the three-year study., “Our research shows that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade will effectively flatten the curve of species at risk. Similar to the Covid-19 pandemic, early action to limit the risk pays off in a big way. It does not eliminate all risk from climate change, but reduces the number of species and ecosystems exposed by a massive amount.”, Scientists have known for years about the likely existence of “tipping points” in the world’s climate, when global heating triggers abrupt or self-reinforcing changes: for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice cap uncovers dark sea beneath, which absorbs more heat than the reflective ice and, in turn, results in more melting., This new paper is one of a growing body of research showing there could be similar tipping points in the natural world, related to climate breakdown. It adds to other studies that have shown the Amazon and other major rainforests are likely to turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources, and shown the extent to which the sea and land have already absorbed the impacts of global heating., Mark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK, said: “There is already more than enough evidence that climate change is impacting the natural world and that we risk losing up to a million species. We know what the solutions are to halt climate change and biodiversity loss., “The world is currently rightly focused on tackling the global health emergency. However, this new research reinforces that, after we are through this extremely difficult time, we will need renewed ambitious action to address the climate and nature crisis.”wildlife destruction not a slippery slope but a series of cliff edges", "label": 0}, "train-628": {"text": "Scientists create mutant enzyme that recycles plastic bottles in hours, Bacterial enzyme originally found in compost can be used to make high-quality new bottles, A mutant bacterial enzyme that breaks down plastic bottles for recycling in hours has been created by scientists., The enzyme, originally discovered in a compost heap of leaves, reduced the bottles to chemical building blocks that were then used to make high-quality new bottles. Existing recycling technologies usually produce plastic only good enough for clothing and carpets., The company behind the breakthrough, Carbios, said it was aiming for industrial-scale recycling within five years. It has partnered with major companies including Pepsi and L’Oréal to accelerate development. Independent experts called the new enzyme a major advance., Billions of tonnes of plastic waste have polluted the  planet, from the Arctic to the deepest ocean trench, and pose a particular risk to sea life. Campaigners say reducing the use of plastic is key, but the company said the strong, lightweight material was very useful and that true recycling was part of the solution., The new enzyme was revealed in research published on Wednesday in the journal Nature. The work began with the screening of 100,000 micro-organisms for promising candidates, including the leaf compost bug, which was first discovered in 2012., “It had been completely forgotten, but it turned out to be the best,” said Prof Alain Marty at the Université de Toulouse, France, the chief science officer at Carbios., The scientists analysed the enzyme and introduced mutations to improve its ability to break down the PET plastic from which drinks bottles are made. They also made it stable at 72C, close to the perfect temperature for fast degradation., The team used the optimised enzyme to break down a tonne of waste plastic bottles, which were 90% degraded within 10 hours. The scientists then used the material to create new food-grade plastic bottles., Carbios has a deal with the biotechnology company Novozymes to produce the new enzyme at scale using fungi. It said the cost of the enzyme was just 4% of the cost of virgin plastic made from oil., Waste bottles also have to be ground up and heated before the enzyme is added, so the recycled PET will be more expensive than virgin plastic. But Martin Stephan, the deputy chief executive at Carbios, said existing lower-quality recycled plastic sells at a premium due to a shortage of supply., “We are the first company to bring this technology on the market,” said Stephan. “Our goal is to be up and running by 2024, 2025, at large industrial scale.”, He said a reduction in plastic use was one part of solving the waste problem. “But we all know that plastic brings a lot of value to society, in food, medical care, transportation. The problem is plastic waste.” Increasing the collection of plastic waste was key, Stephan said, with about half of all plastic ending up in the environment or in landfill., Another team of scientists revealed in 2018 that they had accidentally created an enzyme that breaks down plastic drinks bottles. One of the team behind this advance, Prof John McGeehan, the director of the Centre for Enzyme Innovation at the University of Portsmouth, said Carbios was the leading company engineering enzymes to break down PET at large scale and that the new work was a major advance., “It makes the possibility of true industrial-scale biological recycling of PET a possibility. This is a very large advance in terms of speed, efficiency and heat tolerance,” McGeehan said. “It represents a significant step forward for true circular recycling of PET and has the potential to reduce our reliance on oil, cut carbon emissions and energy use, and incentivise the collection and recycling of waste plastic.”, Scientists are also making progress in finding biological ways to break down other major types of plastic.

I found the unlucky creature at the bottom of a sweetie jar that I had filled with cocoa-coloured balls that looked like Maltesers but were as hard as walnut shells., I began picking the oak marble galls out, rolling each smooth sphere in the palm of my hand. Some had been punctured by a single hole, others riddled like a pepperpot, a sign of multiple occupancy. Their inhabitants had survived an infancy in darkness to drill their way out, making a round window into the autumn light long before I plucked these strange fruits towards the end of winter. All except this single shrivelled wasp that had waited too late and emerged only to be trapped under a glass sky., I sawed one of the single-tenancy galls in half through its exit hole. Though the wasp larva had eaten away a tunnel of fibrous innards, the cut cross-section showed it had consumed less than a fifth of the contents. Then I ground the rest of the galls to dust and began to follow a process of human alchemy that is more than 1,300 years old., Our ancestors understood the properties of oak tannins when they stained their hands felling and shaping wood. But what made them learn that such dyes became concentrated in galls, the wound-like tissue that the tree produces to envelop an invading organism and isolate it from its host? What possessed our ancestors to pound marble galls into powder, steep them in water as a brown soupy sludge, then add rusty iron and gum arabic from acacia trees, to turn the liquid so black it was almost blue?, For more than a thousand years, gall ink was the go-to permanent marker for every document of note – Leonardo’s sketches, the Brandenburg Concertos and America’s founding fathers promising “the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity”.

Today, a paper in the journal Science says these “long-lived pioneers” contribute more than previously believed to carbon sequestration and biomass increase., The authors said their study highlights the importance of forest protection and biodiversity as a strategy to ease global heating. They say it should also encourage global climate modellers to shift away from representing all the trees in a forest as essentially the same., “This analysis shows that that is not good enough for tropical forests and provides a way forward,” said Caroline Farrior, an assistant professor of integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin. “We show that the variation in tropical forest species’ growth, survival and reproduction is important for predicting forest carbon storage.”, Long-lived pioneers – a term that has been around for decades – include species such as mahogany, Brazil nut trees and Ceiba pentandra, which are visible far above the rest of the canopy because they grow fast (at up to twice the speed of plants lower in the canopy) for hundreds of years., Researchers believe this is the result of a trade-off between stature and reproduction: they are able to put more energy into putting on biomass than into producing offspring., The study is based on more than 30 years of data collected from old growth and secondary rainforest on Barro Colorado, an island in the middle of the Panama Canal., The scientists grouped the 282 different species of tree into five categories determined by growth, reproduction and longevity. This showed the relative roles of “fast” species that grow and die quickly, “slow” species that grow slowly and reach an old age, “infertile giants” that live long and reproduce over a long time, and “fertile dwarfs” and small shrubs and low treelets that grow slowly, die young, but produce a large number of offspring., By simulating different combinations of these groups, the scientists were able to build a model that reproduced the dynamics of the recovery of nearby young forests., This knowledge of how quickly trees grow, how long they live and how many offspring they produce could help in the restoration of tropical forests, which are currently being cut down at an alarming rate. It could also dispel a theory that such giant trees disappear once a forest reaches maturity., “Our results show long-lived pioneers are not transient but an important feature in old forests. They represent about 40% of the biomass and there are no signs that this declines over time,” said the paper’s lead author, Nadja Rüger of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research and the University of Leipzig.

The new draft policy has provided even more., “The signal is the first ever from a ministry that dogs are not food animals,” Paul Littlefair, international head of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told the Guardian. “This leaves the door open for local governments to follow Shenzhen’s lead.”, While not officially a ban on the consumption of dog meat, the draft policy from the agriculture ministry could be a “game changer moment for animal welfare in China”, Wendy Higgins of Humane Society International (HSI) told the Guardian., “That signals a major shift, recognising that most people in China don’t eat dogs and cats and want an end to the theft of their companion animals for a meat trade that only a small percentage of the population indulge in,” Higgins said.HSI estimates that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at around 4 million per year., Most of these are stolen animals and not raised in captive breeding facilities, Higgins said., “Not only does it cause enormous animal suffering, but it is also almost entirely fuelled by crime and, perhaps most significantly right now, poses an undeniable human health threat with the risk of diseases such as rabies and cholera,” she said., The updated agriculture ministry list includes the addition of several wildlife species allowed to be farmed under animal husbandry laws if the policy is not altered following a public comment period that runs through May 8., Wildlife such as deer, game birds, along with mink, two kinds of foxes, and other animals were included on a list of animals expected to be approved as farm-raised species once China’s central government lifts a ban on the wildlife trade., The temporary wildlife trade ban was imposed from late January in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, largely thought to have originated in the formal or illicit wildlife supply chain., But campaigners hope the government will go still further. Peter Li, China Policy Specialist with HSI, told the Guardian: “Listing wild animals, including foxes and raccoon dogs, as ‘special livestock’ is concerning. Rebranding wildlife as livestock doesn’t alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in farm environments, their welfare needs simply can’t be met. In addition, there’s clear evidence that some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as Covid-19, which is why we’re urging China and all governments to stop trading in wildlife.”china signals end to dog meat consumption by humans", "label": 0}, "train-633": {"text": "\nCoronavirus may prove boost for UK's bees and rare wildflowers\n, Populations could recover as verges are left uncut, setting what conservationists hope will be a long-term trend, \nJonathan Watts, \n\nThu 9 Apr 2020 09.07 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 9 Apr 2020 09.23 EDT\n\n, Rare wildflowers and declining bee populations could start to recover during the coronavirus lockdown because many councils are leaving roadside verges uncut, according to Europe’s biggest conservation charity for wild plants., The respite for these mini-meadows is likely to lead to an explosion of colour in the countryside this summer and bring benefits to other pollinators, including butterflies, birds and bats, botanists at Plantlife said., Roadside verges are one of the last refuges for the many plant species that have been devastated by the conversion of natural meadows into farmland and housing estates. These narrow strips of grassland are home to 700 species of wildflowers, nearly 45% of the UK’s total flora., Their potential role as conservation areas, however, is normally undermined each spring by local councils when they mow the roadsides. This cuts down many plants before they can flower and seed, leading to a steady decline of oxeye daisy, yellow rattle, wild carrot, meadow crane’s-bill, greater knapweed, white campion, burnet-saxifrage, betony, harebell and field scabious., Plantlife says this may be the best summer for years for these plants because several councils are redistributing resources to other activities as a result of the pandemic., Flintshire, Lincolnshire, Newcastle, Norfolk and Somerset are among the growing number of councils that are scaling back or delaying their verge mowing operations. Some local authorities, such as Devon, had already begun to accept that this should be done later and less frequently., Trevor Dines, Plantlife’s botanical specialist, said this could be a silver lining to the coronavirus crisis. “It’s a real opportunity for verges to flower again, some for the first time,” he said. “If the lockdown ends in late May, drivers will see great swaths of oxeye daisies and ladies bedstraw.”, Grass near junctions and sight lines needs to be trimmed more regularly for safety reasons, but he said most stretches of road can be left until much later in the year so that motorists can see the benefits outweigh the risks. “Our message to councils is that if you haven’t cut verges until now then leave them until August and gauge the response from the public,” he said., Kate Petty, the group’s road verge campaign manager, said the extraordinary short-term circumstances of the pandemic could help to shift opinion and policies with long-term benefits for threatened species such as wood-calamint., “The fix is startlingly straightforward. Simply cutting verges less and later will save plants, money and reduce emissions. We need to rewild ourselves and accept nature’s wonderful ‘messiness’,” she said., Dines, who is also a beekeeper, said later and less frequent verge-mowing would help other species that depend on wildflowers., “This will certainly be good for pollinators. Last year, we already saw improvement in the areas where councils were cutting less. I had my best ever year for honey,” he said. “It’s also good for mental health. People are desperate for wildlife and colour right now. Let’s see what the public response is. For lots of commuters, myself included, verges are the only chance to see wild plants.”, This year will almost certainly see much lower levels of wildlife roadkill. Past estimates suggest cars and trucks in the UK killed about 100,000 hedgehogs, 100,000 foxes, 50,000 badgers, 30,000 deer a year as well as barn owls and many other species of bird and insect.coronavirus may prove boost for uks bees and rare wildflowers", "label": 0}, "train-634": {"text": "\nBamboo rats left in limbo as breeders push back against China wildlife ban\n, Farms forced to shut down operations as search continues for source of Covid-19 amid uncertainty over new industry rules , \nMichael Standaert and Jonathan Zhong in Shenzhen, \n\nThu 9 Apr 2020 08.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 9 Apr 2020 08.09 EDT\n\n, Just a few months ago Cheng Yongcai ran a thriving farm that produced 20,000 bamboo rats a year in Qingyuan in northern Guangdong province., It was an operation that his local government actively encouraged with loans and other support, he says., But the Covid-19 outbreak, widely suspected of originating in China’s huge wildlife industry supply chain, has led to a complete halt in Yongcai’s operation, now shut indefinitely while he awaits final rules on what will be allowed once the crisis is over., China put in place a temporary ban on all wildlife trading and consumption in late February. But a final determination as to what will be legal or illegal after years of lacklustre regulation has been postponed until authorities in Beijing can get a handle on the human side of the outbreak., “We still haven’t been told what to do, except that we can’t sell or release or even cull them until further notice, so we’re still keeping them, and that’s been costing us about 300 yuan £34 per day for the past three months,” Yongcai, 30, told the Guardian by phone., “We hope to transition to other types of business but until it’s clear what to do with the rats, it’s easier said than done,” he said. “We would need funding and the right facility for that.”, Like Yongcai, many other wildlife farmers are increasingly irked by the bans on the trade, in place since late January. They argue that they are being unfairly blamed when no evidence has been provided by the Chinese government pinpointing the exact source of the outbreak., Certain types of bats and pangolins have been identified by epidemiological studies as natural carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 viruses that spawned Covid-19. But it is still unclear how likely either of these are to have been the source. Meanwhile, other animals such as civet cats, bamboo rats and several kinds of rodents have been shown to be carriers of coronaviruses., The problem is that the regulation and oversight of the sector has been confusing. The last updated catalogue of terrestrial wildlife approved for breeding by Chinese authorities that the Guardian could find, which appears to be dated 2008, includes civet cats. But it does not include pangolins, bats, or bamboo rats., Yet, local governments, the state forestry and grassland administration and their provincial bureaus have encouraged and supported all sorts of wildlife farms. “The real number could be hundreds or even over a thousand kinds of wild animal species with no regulation,” said Yin Shanchuan, a volunteer with the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation who has long been involved in investigations with the group., “Somehow these were still allowed by the forestry authorities,” Yin said., Recently, the industry association that lobbies for farming bamboo rats has called for the government to continue allowing the animals to be bred, arguing that they have been encouraged for years and have not been found to be the source of the Covid-19 outbreak., The group declined to comment about its appeal to lift the ban when contacted by the Guardian on 3 April., “Of course, it’s a bit unfair, because for people in the rural areas, this is a very profitable business,” Yongcai said. “You don’t need to invest a lot, you don’t cause much pollution and you only have to feed them bamboo and grass.”, Gao Guanxing, a farmer in a village near Heyuan, Guangdong, was one of thousands who went into wildlife breeding in recent years as part of China’s efforts to alleviate poverty by the end of 2020. In 2016 he started to rear bamboo rats, and he was among farmers feted by officials from nearby Shenzhen and the local government., But now those same local officials are attempting to persuade 230 families who went into breeding bamboo rats, wild boar, snakes, civet cats, frogs and Sika deer to turn to other forms of commerce: brewing, raising chickens, digging fish ponds, with compensation available of up to £23,000 per operation., Guanxing has been encouraged to go into mushroom farming. “After the two old bamboo rat houses are cleaned and disinfected, they will become a three-dimensional mushroom farm,” he told state-run financial newspaper Yicai, adding that once his mushrooms are planted and growing he’ll be able to produce 50kg per day. Attempts to reach Guanxing directly were not successful., Yongcai is in a more difficult position as his farm wasn’t officially part of a poverty alleviation programme, so it is uncertain whether he’ll qualify for compensation or additional assistance to switch to another form of production., “We’ve heard how the Heyuan government is helping breeders there to take up other business such as growing mushrooms and raising chickens, but that’s just for the impoverished household breeders,” Yongcai said. “For regular breeders, we’re still on our own and awaiting a decision.”, What is unknown is what will happen once the government finally decides how to regulate the wildlife industry. Officials have discussed moving certain forms of wildlife that are not endangered or protected, nor known potential sources of zoonotic disease, to a list that would allow them to be bred under rules usually meant for poultry and livestock. No comprehensive list for those changes has been released., Theoretically, these rules from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs would provide for safer operations, with those continuing in the business required to have larger-scale operations and biosecurity measures to prevent disease transfer., Yet, as has been seen in the outbreaks of African swine fever among China’s pig farms in recent years, which led to the deaths of millions of swine through the disease and culling, even those measures continue to fail to contain the spread of disease., “I am optimistic that bamboo rats won’t be included in the livestock and poultry list,” Aili Kang, Asia director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told the Guardian. “Currently, the law does not use very biological or ecological definitions. Nor do they use a very pure definitions from a zoonotic disease kind of component.” As for Yongcai, he understands that animals can carry viruses and disease, and while he previously sanitised his operation once a month, he is now required to do so each week for the rats that remain in limbo., “I don’t think bamboo rats pose that big a threat,” he said. “Plus, there’s no conclusion yet on where the new coronavirus is from.”bamboo rats left in limbo as breeders push back against china wildlife ban", "label": 0}, "train-635": {"text": "\nHow the coronavirus crisis got me back on my bike and feeling free\n, Having not been in the saddle for 15 years, Toby Chasseaud overcomes his nerves to beat the travel shutdown, Contact author, \n\nThu 9 Apr 2020 02.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 9 Apr 2020 02.58 EDT\n\n, Like many Londoners, the majority of my journeys over the past 13 years have been underground. I last cycled, briefly, in Brighton in 2005 and found even that short spell somewhat nerve-racking, with drivers cutting in front of me without indicating or even looking to see if anyone was there., If you can’t beat them, join them, I figured. I gave my bike away, bought a car again and thought nothing more of cycling. When I moved to London the tube became my default mode of transport and would remain so for years – until a few weeks ago.Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been told to avoid using public transport unless absolutely necessary. I’ve always considered my work to be important, but could I justify squeezing into the underground with doctors and nurses – the true heroes of this crisis – potentially putting them, as well as myself and my Guardian colleagues, at risk?So I resolve to buy a bike again to allow me to stay mobile while keeping a safe distance from others. I had feared that every Londoner would have the same idea as me, so when I arrive at the bike shop I’m pleasantly surprised to find I’m the only customer there, and the owner proceeds to talk me through the options available., I want something basic and we decide that the Forme Cromford – a versatile hybrid bike built for reliability – could be the one for me. I leave my driver’s licence (not used for years) and my bank card with him and take it on a test ride., As I feared, it’s been so long since I was in the saddle that I can barely remember how to change gear and no sooner have I got 50 metres than the chain comes off. Still, the shop owner, having put it back on, assures me I’ll quickly get back into the swing of things. It’s like, well, riding a bike. Feeling somewhat embarrassed, I set off again and tentatively – probably too tentatively – work my way through the gears.I tell the owner I’ll take it, and also buy a phone holder, pannier bag, front and back lights, a helmet, a lock, gloves and a light windproof jacket. I end up spending more on the accessories than I do on the bike itself but am relieved that I’ve managed to get fully kitted out in the space of an hour and a half., I take my new ride for a spin over Walthamstow Marshes and, other than the chain coming off again, have no major mishaps. On the roads I’m nervous at junctions, sometimes dismounting and walking in order to avoid intimidating right turns. My anxiety is partly because I was one of only two children in my primary school class of 33 pupils not to take part in cycling proficiency sessions because we didn’t have bikes.But I figure I’d better learn fast. I pay £49 to join the London Cycling Campaign, which, as well as lobbying to make the capital safer for cycling, provides free third party insurance. I then venture nine miles along main roads to Hampstead Heath, with Google Maps talking to me as I go and I get there in one piece. I’m growing in confidence, though the journey back is tougher as I have to contend with a headwind. Roads I’d always considered to be flat now have readily apparent upward and downward slopes.The next day I’m due back in the office and I allow plenty of time to get there. It’s 7.5 miles along cycle lanes and roads to the Guardian and I’m surprised by how often Google tells me to turn right at busy junctions, but I get there OK. The security woman is suspicious of me as I don’t know my way around the building’s hidden depths. “How long have you worked here?” she asks. More than 10 years, I reply.When I head upstairs, colleagues don’t recognise me when I say good morning because they’ve never seen me disguised as a cyclist before. The office has an eerie feeling about it. Where there are usually hundreds of people there are now just dozens – the security staff, the cleaners (more important now than ever), and those of us able to get in to put the newspaper together., It’s a gruelling shift, beset by the difficulties of trying to communicate with those already working from home and get them up to speed with new systems that have been hurriedly put in place within the space of a few days. We’re inundated with news of the virus spreading, major events being cancelled, and people dying. A week’s worth of bad news is crammed into the space of an hour.As I catch the lift down to the bike deck at the end of the day I’m feeling worn out and this will be the first time in years that I’ve ridden at night. I put my lights on and don a hi-vis yellow vest, a relic from a driving holiday to France some years earlier. But at least the weather is dry and the roads are less busy than usual, though a minority of petrol-heads have used this as an opportunity to treat them as if they’re a race track., I pedal home and, despite my exhaustion, I find the experience relaxing, helping me to switch off from the stresses of the office and of a world gone mad. I think it must help me to sleep too.I repeat this journey on subsequent days but tweak my route to reduce the number of awkward right turns. Then the technical team manage to allow us to produce the newspaper from our homes and I no longer need to go into the office, where only a handful of the most essential staff are left.It feels strange working from home for the first time ever, with my living room turned into a makeshift office. My life is now confined within the walls of my one-bedroom residence and everyday face-to-face conversations are replaced by typing in a chatroom. Yet on days off the bike allows me to rediscover some freedom., I’m a keen cricketer and the start to my season has inevitably been delayed by Covid-19, but the bike gives me my physical fix. On the Saturday that we had been due to play our first match I instead cycle to Epping Forest. On my way there I’m overtaken by plenty of serious cyclists, wearing lycra and riding bikes that must be far lighter and more advanced than mine. Still, I’m happy to be out and about and when I arrive at the forest, with its hundreds of trails, it provides an oasis of calm amid all the chaos and confusion of the outside world. It’s good to be back in the saddle.how the coronavirus crisis got me back on my bike and feeling free", "label": 0}, "train-636": {"text": "The secret call of the wild: how animals teach each other to survive, \nThe secret call of the wild: how animals teach each other to survive\n, Cultural knowledge, passed from animal to animal, is key to how species adapt to change in the world around them, by  Carl Safina, \n\nThu 9 Apr 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 9 Apr 2020 01.32 EDT\n\n, Sam Williams’ Macaw Recovery Network in Costa Rica rewilds captivity-hatched fledgling scarlet and great green macaws. But introducing young birds into a complex forest world – bereft of the cultural education normally provided by parents – is slow and risky., For 30 years or so scientists have referred to the diversity of life on Earth as “biological diversity”, or just “biodiversity”. They usually define biodiversity as operating at three levels: the diversity of genes within any particular species; the diversity of species in a given place; and the diversity of habitat types such as forests, coral reefs, and so on. But does that cover it? Not really. A fourth level has been almost entirely overlooked: cultural diversity., Culture is knowledge and skills that flow socially from individual to individual and generation to generation. It’s not in genes. Socially learned skills, traditions and dialects that answer the question of “how we live here” are crucial to helping many populations survive – or recover. Crucially, culturally learned skills vary from place to place. In the human family many cultures, underappreciated, have been lost. Culture in the other-than-human world has been almost entirely missed., We are just recognising that in many species, survival skills must be learned from elders who learned from their elders. Until now, culture has remained a largely hidden, unrecognised layer of wild lives. Yet for many species culture is both crucial and fragile. Long before a population declines to numbers low enough to seem threatened with extinction, their special cultural knowledge, earned and passed down over long generations, begins disappearing. Recovery of lost populations then becomes much more difficult than bringing in a few individuals and turning them loose., Many young birds learn much by observing their parents, and parrots probably need to learn more than most. Survival of released individuals is severely undermined if there are no free-living elder role models. Trying to restore parrot populations by captive breeding is not as easy as training young or orphaned creatures to recognise what is food while they’re in the safety of a cage – then simply opening the door. “In a cage,” Williams says, “you can’t train them to know where, when and how to find that food, or about trees with good nest sites.” Parents would normally have done exactly that., A generational break in cultural traditions hampered attempts to reintroduce thick-billed parrots to parts of south-west America, where they’d been wiped out. Conservation workers could not teach the captive-raised parrots to search for and find their traditional wild foods, skills they would have learned from parents., Landscapes, always complex, are under accelerated change. Culture enables adaptation far faster than genes alone can navigate hairpin turns in time. In some places, pigeons and sparrows have learned to use motion-sensors to get inside enclosed shopping malls and forage for crumbs. Crows have in some locales learned to drop nuts on the road for cars to crack. In at least one area they do this at intersections, so they can safely walk out and collect their cracked prizes when the light turns red and the cars stop. They’ve developed answers to the new question: “How can we survive here, in this never-before world?”, Because the answers are local, and learned from elders, wild cultures can be lost faster than genetic diversity. When populations plummet, traditions that helped animals survive and adapt to a place begin to vanish., In a scientific article on the vocabulary of larks living in north Africa and Spain titled, “Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes”, researchers reported that as human development shrinks habitats into patches, “isolation is associated with impoverishment”. They write: “Song repertoires pass through a cultural bottleneck and significantly decline in variety.”, Unfortunately, isolated larks are not an isolated case. Researchers studying South America’s orange-billed sparrow found that sparrow “song complexity” – the number of syllables per song and song length – deteriorated as humans continued whittling their forests into fragments. When a scientist replayed 24-year-old recordings of singing male white-crowned sparrows at the same location she’d recorded them, they elicited half the responses they had when first recorded. The birds’ responses show that changes in the dialect lead to changes in listener preference, a bit analogous to pop music. And as with humans, preferences can affect whether a particular bird will be accepted as a mate. White-crowned sparrows singing a local dialect become fathers of more offspring than do singers of unfamiliar dialects, indicating females prefer a familiar tune., I’m not just talking about a few songs. Survival of numerous species depends on cultural adaptation. How many? We’re just beginning to ask such questions. But the preliminary answers indicate surprising and widespread ways that animals survive by cultural learning. Regionally different vocalisations are sometimes called “song traditions” but the more commonly used word is “dialects”. More than a hundred studies have been published on dialects in birds. And it’s not just birds but a wide array of animals Including some fish., “Cod particularly,” said Steve Simpson of the University of Exeter, “have very elaborate calls compared with many fish.” You can easily hear differences in recorded calls of American and European Atlantic cod. “This species is highly vocal with traditional breeding grounds established over hundreds or even thousands of years.” Many fish follow elders to feeding, resting and breeding areas. In experiments, introduced outsiders who learned such preferred locales by following elders continued to use these traditional routes after all the original fish from whom they learned were gone., Cultural survival skills erode as habitats shrink. Maintaining genetic diversity is not enough. We’ve become accustomed to a perilous satisfaction with precariously minimal populations that not only risk genetic viability of populations but almost guarantee losing local cultural knowledge by which populations have lived and survived., In all free-living parrots that have been studied, nestlings develop individually unique calls, learned from their parents. Researchers have described this as “an intriguing parallel with human parents naming infants”. Indeed, these vocal identities help individuals distinguish neighbours, mates, sexes and individuals; the same functions that human names serve., Williams tells me that when he studied Amazon parrots, he could hear differences between them saying, essentially, “Let’s go”, “I’m here, where are you?” and “Darling, I just brought breakfast”. Researchers who develop really good ears for parrot vocalisation and use technology to study recordings show that parrot noise is more organised and meaningful than it sounds to beginners like me. In a study of budgerigars, for instance, birds who were unfamiliar with each other were placed together. Groups of unfamiliar females took a few weeks for their calls to converge and sound similar. Males copied the calls of females. Black-capped chickadees flock members’ calls converge, so they can distinguish members of their own flock from those of other flocks. The fact that this happens, and that it takes weeks, suggests that free-living groups must normally be stable, that groups have their own identity, and that the members identify with their group., Group identity, we see repeatedly, is not exclusively human. Sperm whales learn and announce their group identity. Young fruit bats learn the dialects of the crowds they’re in. Ravens know who’s in, who’s out. Too many animals to list know what group, troop, family or pack they belong with. In Brazil, some dolphins drive fish toward fishermen’s nets for a share of the catch. Other dolphins don’t. The ones who do, sound different from the ones who don’t. Various dolphin groups who specialise in a food-getting technique won’t socialise with other groups who use different techniques. And orca whales, the most socially complex non-humans, have layered societies of pods, clans and communities, with community members all knowing the members of all their constituent pods, but each community scrupulously avoiding contact with members of another community. All this social organisation is learned from elders., Elders appear important for social learning of migratory routes. Various storks, vultures, eagles and hawks all depend on following the cues of elders to locate strategic migration flyways or important stopover sites. These could be called their migration cultures. Famously, conservationists have raised young cranes, geese and swans to follow microlight aircraft as a surrogate parent on first migrations. Without such enculturation, they would not have known where to go. The young birds absorbed knowledge of routes, then used them in later seasons on their own self-guided migrations. Four thousand species of birds migrate, so Andrew Whiten of the University of St Andrews in Scotland speculates that following experienced birds may be an underappreciated but “very significant realm of cultural transmission”., When you look at free-living animals, you don’t usually see culture. Culture makes itself visible when it gets disrupted. Then we see that the road back to reestablishing cultures – the answers to the questions of “how we live in this place” – is difficult, often fatal., Young mammals too – moose, bison, deer, antelope, wild sheep, ibex and many others – learn crucial migration routes and destinations from elder keepers of traditional knowledge. Conservationists have recently reintroduced large mammals in a few areas where they’ve been wiped out, but because animals released into unfamiliar landscapes don’t know where food is, where dangers lurk, or where to go in changing seasons, many translocations have failed., Williams describes his procedure with the macaws as “very much a slow release”. First his team trains the birds to use a feeder. With that safety net, they can explore the forest, gain local knowledge, begin dispersing and using wild foods., Some rescue programmes declare success if a released animal survives one year. “A year is meaningless for a bird like a macaw that doesn’t mature until it’s eight years old,” says Williams., I ask what they’re doing for those eight long years., “Social learning,” Williams replies immediately. “Working out who’s who, how to interact, like kids in school.”, To gain access to the future, to mate and to raise young, the birds Williams is releasing must enter into the culture of their kind. But from whom will they learn, if no one is out there? At the very least they must be socially oriented to one another. Ex-pets are the worst candidates for release; they don’t interact appropriately with other macaws, and they want to hang around near humans. , To assess the social abilities of 13 scarlet macaws who were scheduled for release, Williams and his crew documented how much time they spent close to another bird, how often they initiated aggression, things like that. When the bird scoring lowest for social skills was released, he flew out the door and was never seen again. The next-to-lowest didn’t adapt to the free-living life and had to be retrieved. The third-lowest social scorer remained at liberty but stayed alone a lot. The rest did well., All of the above adds up to this: a species isn’t just one big jar of jellybeans of the same colour. It’s different smaller jars with differing hues in different places. From region to region, genetics can vary. And cultural traditions can differ. Different populations might use different tools, different migration routes, different ways of calling, courting and being understood. All populations have their answers to the question of how to live where they live., “Sometimes a group will be foraging in a tree,” Williams says. “A pair will fly overhead on a straight path. Someone will make a contact call, and the flying birds will loop around and land with the callers. They seem to have their friends.” Bottom line, said Williams, there is much going on in the social and cultural lives of his macaws and other species, much that they understand – but we don’t. We have a lot of questions. The answers must lurk, somewhere, in their minds., As land, weather and climate change, some aspects of cultural knowledge will be the tickets necessary for boarding the future. Others will die out. Across the range of chimpanzees, cultures vary greatly, as do habitats. All populations but one use stick tools. Some use simple probes, others fashion multi-stick toolsets. Only one population makes pointed daggers for hunting small nocturnal primates called bush-babies hiding in tree holes. Only the westernmost chimpanzees crack nuts with stones., As researchers have noted, distinctive tool-using traditions at particular sites are defining features of unique chimpanzee cultures. Whiten wrote: “Chimpanzee communities resemble human cultures in possessing suites of local traditions that uniquely identify them … A complex social inheritance system that complements the genetic picture.”, Some chimpanzee populations have learned to track the progress of dozens of specific trees ripening in their dense forests. Others live in open semi-savannah. Some are more aggressively male-dominated, some populations more egalitarian. Some almost never see people; some live in sight of human settlements and have learned to crop-raid at night. For a long, long time chimpanzees have been works in progress. “We’ve learned,” writes Craig Stanford, “not to speak of ‘The Chimpanzee’.” Chimpanzees vary and chimpanzee culture is variable at every level., “It’s not just the loss of populations of chimps that worries me,” Cat Hobaiter emphasised when I spent several weeks with her studying chimpanzees in Uganda. “I find terrifying the possibility of losing each population’s unique culture. That’s permanent.”, Diversity in cultural pools – perhaps more crucially than in gene pools – will make species survival more likely. If pressures cause regional populations to blink out, a species’ odds of persisting dim., Williams’ goal is to re-establish macaws where they range no longer, in hopes that they, and their forests, will recover. (Most of the central American forests that macaws need have been felled and burned, largely so fast-food burger chains can sell cheap beef.) It often takes a couple of generations for human immigrant families to learn how to function effectively in their new culture; it may take two or three generations before an introduced population of macaws succeeds. In other words, macaws are born to be wild. But becoming wild requires an education., So what’s at stake is not just numbers. What’s at stake is: ways of knowing how to be in the world. Culture isn’t just a boutique concern. Cultural knowledge is what allows many populations to survive. Keeping the knowledge of how to live in a habitat can be almost as important to the persistence of a species as keeping the habitat; both are needed. Cultural diversity itself is a source of resilience and adaptability to change. And change is accelerating., This is an edited extract from Becoming Wild: How Animals Learn to be Animals by Carl Safina, which published in the UK by Oneworld on 9 April and in the US by Henry Holt and Co on 14 April, the secret call of the wild how animals teach each other to survive aoe", "label": 0}, "train-637": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a gang of outlaws roam the garden\n, Wenlock Edge, Shropshire: The robin, bee-fly and other anarchic creatures enact their Wild West dramas of the soil, \nPaul Evans, \n\nThu 9 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 9 Apr 2020 12.12 EDT\n\n, ‘In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya / Billy, you’re so far away from home,” sang Bob Dylan, and Billy the Kid rises from the grave in our back garden. Scuffing the soil in the shadow of a flowering currant, a tiny human shape catches my daughter’s eye. She picks it up and rubs the subterranean years off to discover a little brass figurine, an inch or so tall, of Billy the Kid. His rifle is broken but his cocky pose and battered sugar-loaf hat are as distinctive as the 1880s photograph taken not long before he was shot dead aged 21. How he got here goodness knows, but Billy shines in bright spring sunshine., He may be far from home but he’s not the only outlaw in this garden. Watching from the hedge is Robin Redbreast; as quixotic a mix of charm and violence as Billy, Robin is a mythic creature loved by the people, too. He cocks his head to watch everything we do. He has no fear of us. We are, after all, only substitutes for wild pigs rooting through the earth; he waits for a fork to turn up the real treasure in the soil – worms. “Who killed Cock Robin?” asks the 18th-century murder rhyme. “Who saw him die? / I, said the Fly / with my little eye.”, A ginger dot on whirring wings bounces over the surface of the soil in a curious flight behaviour called “yawing”. This is Bombylius major, the large or dark-edged bee-fly. She is searching for the tunnel entrances to the underground nests of the solitary bees she mimics. The bee-fly is a true fly and a parasite of bees; she will flick her eggs down their tunnels and when they hatch they will wriggle into the bee’s nest to feed on the larvae. In the meantime, the bee-fly’s yawing helps pollinate spring flowers., Anarchic creatures enact their dramas in the Wild West of the soil, “Up to Boot Hill they’d like to send ya / Billy, don’t you turn your back on me”, buried secrets and dirt under our fingernails connect us back to growing and the source of life.country diary a gang of outlaws roam the garden", "label": 0}, "train-638": {"text": "\nThe week in wildlife – in pictures\n, The week in wildlife – in pictures, The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including Indian monkeys and a Parisian duck, , \n\nFri 10 Apr 2020 12.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 10 Apr 2020 12.52 EDT\n\n, Photograph: Nicolas Armer/DPA, Photograph: Andrew Fosker/Rex/Shutterstock, Photograph: Michael Probst/AP, Photograph: Jorge Sáenz/AP, Photograph: Miguel Gutiérrez/EPA, Photograph: DNPWC/WWF Nepal/PA, Photograph: Marc Piscotty/Getty Images, Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA, Photograph: Roberta Basile/IPA/Rex/Shutterstock, Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock, Photograph: Nir Keidar/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images, Photograph: Aytac Unal/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images, Photograph: Getty Images, Photograph: Yasin Akgül/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Natalia Fedosenko/Tass/Getty images, Photograph: Jonas Gratzer, Photograph: Dani Ceccarellithe week in wildlife in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-639": {"text": "Dandelion: the plant that keeps giving, Pat Lambert says dandelions were a substitute for coffee during the war, fed rabbits and treated warts, while Rosemary Ross is adding lamb’s lettuce to salads, The root of the dandelion (Letters, 8 April) was highly valued as a substitute for coffee during the war.

Staff at the charity have also identified “pockets of need” in Shetland and as far south as Newlyn in Cornwall. This comes just before the Easter holiday, traditionally a period of increased demand., Claire McIntosh, the Mission’s area official for south-east Scotland, has been working 12-hour days fielding calls from crews whose skippers have had to tie up their boats., “I’ve been liaising with food banks since January,” said McIntosh, whose patch covers the 80 miles of coastline from Seahouses in Northumberland to Port Seton in East Lothian. “This is on the back of poor weather and poor catches during winter. They are very self-sufficient folk, very resilient, resourceful and hard-working. Their last resort is to come to us. But I’ve handed out £17,500 in the last few weeks, compared to £12,000 for the whole of the last year.”, The UK fishing industry is worth £989m annually, with Scottish vessels responsible for more than half, at £574m in 2018. More than 70% of its catch is exported, mainly to Europe and Asia, but foreign and hospitality markets have collapsed in the crisis. While a much smaller retail market still exists for some fish, many supermarkets have shut their fish counters, reducing demand further. For high-value shellfish, the market is now virtually nonexistent., “Langoustine, shrimp and prawn are almost impossible to get rid of and the demand for crab and lobster in China has just vaporised,” said David Dickens, the Mission’s chief executive. “When there’s a pandemic, people aren’t interested in high quality seafood.”, The charity’s 71 staff across the UK are expecting things to get worse., “All the indications are we’re at the beginning of a curve of need,” said Dickens. “This is the calm before the storm. From Kirkcudbright in the south up as far as Mallaig, there’s a lot of very worried people. We’re planning for the worst, but hoping for the best. Our focus is keeping the lights on and keeping food on the table.”, On 25 March, the Scottish government announced a £5m assistance package aimed at 650 seafood companies impacted by the collapse in the market for shellfish, and for owners of full-time registered vessels under 12 metres., Dickens welcomes the scheme, which is underway, but said he and his staff are supporting crew or skippers who are ineligible, including those working part time., A further £10m package for fish processing businesses was announced by the Scottish government on 3 April. A spokesperson said: “Work on the grant to processors is ongoing and we hope to open applications soon.”, They added that further support is being made available, including a £2.2bn grant to help Scottish businesses pay staff and treat them fairly., Donna Fordyce, the interim head of trade marketing body Seafood Scotland, which is working on exploring other alternatives to get Scotland’s seafood to consumers, said: “It’s a pretty grim picture across the board. The seafood sector has been one of the hardest hit of all the sectors in Scotland, because of the level of exports. The market has more or less collapsed in Europe.”, It was already a bad year for fishermen, she said, with the “worst weather we’ve seen for 15 years for fleets”, before the Covid-19 crisis hit., “The prawn and the scallop fleet are more or less all tied up,” said Fordyce. “The whitefish fleet, some are still going out., “It is going to be a UK market for the next few months.”, Scotland has 2,089 registered vessels and 4,860 crew. , Among those waiting to find out if they are eligible for the £10m fund for processors is Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Langoustines and Loch Fyne Seafarms. McMillan, who employs 22 staff directly and a further 48 on vessels, was forced to close temporarily three weeks ago because of the pandemic., “We are waiting with bated breath,” said McMillan, who processes and exports scallops, lobsters and crabs. “If we can’t get that or we are not eligible, we’re finished.”, McMillan is currently paying his staff 80% of their salary, under the coronavirus retention scheme, which he can claim back from the government. But he lost 44% of sales to Hong Kong and China when Covid-19 first hit there, and has been losing money since January., “We are having to pay staff weekly. It’s a huge strain on the business as we haven’t any cash.”, Based in Tarbert, Argyll and Bute, which has a population of 1,500, McMillan is one of the village’s largest employers., “Twenty-two jobs is a lot of families,” McMillan said., “The whole fishing industry is going to look different when we come out of this. Our customers in Hong Kong are saying 50% of their restaurants have not survived.”, Selling direct to the public, a tactic used by some shellfish fishermen in Devon and Cornwall, is more challenging in remote communities in Scotland, he said., “Everyone is trying to sell to the general public but for us it’s very precarious. Businesses like ours depend on volume. I see people in Cornwall doing that. But when you live remotely as we do, there is just not the demand.”scottish fishermen turn to food banks as covid 19 devastates industry", "label": 0}, "train-641": {"text": "\nCountry diary: lessons from the birds on self-isolating\n, Belfast, County Antrim: The tunes vary but the message is the same – ‘Keep your distance, keep your distance’, \nMary Montague, \n\nFri 10 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, Working from home, I’m heeding the counsel of master self-isolators. Every spring, male songbirds carve out their own inviolate space. This row of urban semis and small gardens is a constant racket of avian announcements and warnings. It begins with the robin’s plaintive heralding of first light. If I shook off the duvet’s warmth and peeped through the curtains, I’d see him on his regular streetlight songpost. But I tell myself the movement will disturb him, so I lie on to listen for the dunnock. He’s due any minute. I tense with waiting, praying that his predilection for the garden’s low bushes has not meant that he has succumbed to a cat overnight. Ah! There’s his cheery warble. I can get up., Breakfast is both strangely quiet and startlingly noisy. I live under an airport flight path that’s weirdly muted. But the absence of planes magnifies the birdsong. That chaffinch with his individual take on the terminal flourish of his species’ song. Two wrens rattling sabres across a no-go zone that includes our back garden. As the song of the one in the next street starts overlapping with that of two doors up, it’s only a matter of time. Song overlapping or matching is a sign of aggression. Eventually my neighbour’s wren falls silent. I settle to my laptop., Throughout the day, I get more reminders of the importance of physical distancing. The tunes vary, but the message is the same. From the canopy fringing the River Lagan, an elevenses song thrush, his deliberate flutings clearly audible against the traffic’s lowered growl. Cosy house sparrow chatter accompanies lunch, but bursting through are slurred exhortations of a collared dove and a thin exasperation of a goldcrest. In the afternoon, the nearby pedestrian crossing beeps and a great tit responds with furious monosyllables. I wonder who has provoked him, for when I check the window there’s no one to be seen., Evening: our blackbird has assumed his usual position on the chimney opposite. I stop to listen to his gorgeous baritone. And further away, another. And another. The chain of song reminds me of “all the birds” of Edward Thomas’s Adlestrop. “Farther and farther.” All heeding, all reminding each other: “Keep your distance, keep your distance.”country diary lessons from the birds on self isolating", "label": 0}, "train-642": {"text": "\nExtraordinary portraits of ordinary bugs - in pictures\n, Extraordinary portraits of ordinary bugs - in pictures, Daniel Kariko uses microscopes to create vivid portraits of ordinary insects, including wasps, beetles, silverfish and moths.

My last spring outing before lockdown, I drove steep lanes from Llangollen to the Finger Farm on an eastern ridge of Y Berwyn, from which you look south and west along hill-enfolded Glyn Ceiriog. I’d come to walk the Ceiriog Valley tramway – an old favourite of mine., A dipper, creamy bib gleaming among ambient greys, gave its chinking flight-call as it sped upriver. Water ouzel is the old name for these tubby, hyperactive birds. It fits somehow, though they’re no relation to the ring ouzel, a rare thrush that frequents high streams of the Berwyn moorland where the Afon Ceiriog rises., Little, frilled daffodils of Wales were in flower by the old railway bridge at Pandy. I glanced across to the inn. George Borrow and his guide, John Jones, called there on the walking tour described in Wild Wales (1862) – one of the great classics of British travel writing. They pondered the case of a man who chose to walk an extra mile from home for inferior ale rather than the excellent brew provided here. In the pub parlour a drunken stonemason held forth to them – proof that the widespread quarrying in this valley was already under way in 1854. He recited poems by Huw Morys (aka Eos Ceiriog, “the Ceiriog Nightingale”, 1622-1709), who lived at nearby Pont y Meibion, his Welsh verse radically innovative, influential in its relaxed musicality., Pub closed, I carried on along the tramway, peering left into the huge chasm of Hendre quarry. In the 1960s I’d climbed there, the ledges on its 120-metre wall of granitic rock littered with precarious blocks – “deployments of falsity … sufficient almost to prop up a fascist”, as John Menlove Edwards, tragic pioneer and finest of climbing essayists, wrote in the 1930s about another appallingly loose Welsh cliff. I remember shoving mighty specimens off their resting places, hearing the ensuing thunder between the walls, the cordite smell of their splintering drifting up. We were glad to get out of there, and never returned. Now climbing and quarrying are both finished, leaving behind peregrines, jackdaws, kestrels, and y llonydd gorffenedig – the accomplished silence of all such abandoned places.country diary glyn ceiriog clwyd quarry tramway birds", "label": 0}, "train-644": {"text": "'It's positively alpine!': Disbelief in big cities as air pollution falls, \n'It's positively alpine!': Disbelief in big cities as air pollution falls\n, Delhi is one of many capitals enjoying improved air quality since restrictions were introduced due to the coronavirus , by  Hannah Ellis-Petersen in Delhi,  Rebecca Ratcliffe in Bangkok,  Sam Cowie in São Paulo, Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogotá and  Lily Kuo in Beijing, \n\nSat 11 Apr 2020 00.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 10.42 EDT\n\n, The screenshots began to circulate on Delhi WhatsApp groups last week, captioned with varying expressions of disbelief. Having checked the air quality index, something of a sadistic morning ritual among residents of India’s capital, most could not believe their eyes., Gone was the familiar menacing red banner, indicating how each intake of breath is really just a toxic blast on the lungs, replaced instead by a healthy, cheerful green. Could it really be that Delhi’s pollution levels now fell into the category of … “good”? “It’s positively alpine!” exclaimed one message., A nationwide lockdown imposed across India on 24 March to stop the spread of the coronavirus – the largest lockdown of its kind attempted anywhere – has led to widespread chaos and suffering, especially among the country’s 300 million poor. Yet in Delhi, the world’s most polluted city, it has also resulted in some of the freshest air the capital has seen in decades., It is a lockdown silver lining being repeated across the world, as toxic megacities such as Bangkok, Beijing, São Paulo and Bogotá, where varying coronavirus restrictions have been imposed, all reported an unprecedented decline in pollution. Yet it is countered with one cruel irony: with most residents of these cities strictly confined to their homes, few have any way to appreciate this newly fresh air, except through an open window or a during speedy trip to the supermarket., In Delhi, air quality index (AQI) levels are usually a severe 200 on a good day (anything above 25 is deemed unsafe by World Health Organization). During peak pollution periods last year they soared well into a life-threatening 900 and sometimes off the measurable scale. But as Delhi’s 11m registered cars were taken off the roads and factories and construction were ground to a halt, AQI levels have regularly fallen below 20. The skies are suddenly a rare, piercing blue. Even the birdsong seems louder., Dr Shashi Tharoor, a politician and author who has been vocal on environmental issues, said he hoped that it was a wake-up call. “The blissful sight of blue skies and the joy of breathing clean air provides just the contrast to illustrate what we are doing to ourselves the rest of the time,” said Tharoor. “Today the typical Delhi AQI hovers around 30 and one blissful afternoon, after a spurt of rain, it dropped to 7.”, “Seven,” Tharoor exclaimed again in disbelief. “In Delhi! Pure joy!”., Tharoor’s sister Smita, who was visiting from the UK when the lockdown was imposed and found herself stuck in Delhi, was equally effusive. As someone with asthma, she said the city’s air, normally thick with pollution, was usually a health nightmare. But now: “The air is clear, the skies are blue. I see the evening stars with clarity and hear the chirruping of excited birds at this unexpected bonus they have received.”, While India’s powerful car lobby has long disputed that cars are a major cause of Delhi’s pollution, Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment, said the lockdown and resulting rapid drop in pollution showed once and for all just what a polluting role vehicles had in the city., Narain also stressed that while she wished Delhi was like this “all the time”, adding: “I don’t want people to say ‘Oh, environmentalists are celebrating this lockdown:’ we are not. This is not the solution. But whatever the new normal is post-Covid-19, we have to make sure we take this breath of fresh air and think about the serious efforts we need to deal with pollution in Delhi.”, It is not just Delhi experiencing the clearest skies in years. As pollution dropped to its lowest level in three decades this week this week, residents of Jalandhar in Punjab woke up to an incredible sight in the distance: the Dhauladhar mountain range in Himachal Pradesh. The peaks, which are over 120 miles away, had not been sighted on the Punjab horizon for almost 30 years., It is the absence of cars on some of the world’s most congested roads that seems to be making the most crucial differences. Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, which only last month had closed schools because the pollution got so bad, has experienced a similar transformation in the air since partial lockdown, mainly due to the fall in road traffic. “We can see quite a big gap between the air quality standard that we have compared with this time last year,” says Tara Buakamsri, Thailand director for Greenpeace., But residents of Bangkok lamented how the places to enjoy the fresh air were swiftly disappearing. Playgrounds, sporting grounds and even parks, a rare source of solace in the bustling, intensely urban environs of Bangkok, have all now been shut. “I feel sad for the old people who use the park to hang out and meet friends. I think they will be so sad at home,” said Nantawan Wangudomsuk, 31, a producer who used to run in the parks., Across South America’s most populous city of São Paulo, ground zero of Brazil’s brewing coronavirus crisis, notorious traffic queues and smoggy horizons are also giving way to calm streets and clearer skies., During weekday rush-hour, downtown São Paulo’s João Goulart elevated highway – nicknamed Minhocão, the Big Worm – normally heaves with traffic as thousands of cars cram four narrow lanes and beeping motorbikes weave through daringly small spaces. But with the city’s coronavirus lockdown, Minhocão now resembles a small-town avenue instead of a major road in a metropolis of 12 million people., “The air is certainly better,” said Daniel Guth,an urban mobility consultant. “I’ve felt the improvement in air quality both as a cyclist and as a quarantined citizen,” he laughed. “We should use this as a moment to reflect on what transport methods we should prioritise when this crisis is over.”, Despite being under lockdown, many Paulistas, as the city’s residents are known, are still finding ways to enjoy the cleaner air, taking to windows and apartment balconies for nightly pot-banging protests against Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly dismissed the coronavirus as just “a little flu”., Bogotá, the sprawling mountaintop capital of Colombia, is also usually choking with traffic so bad that officials occasionally ban cars for entire days. But since the nationwide coronavirus quarantine took hold on 24 March, exhaust fumes have fallen as the city ground to a halt. Yet the newly fresh air has been taunting Bogotá’s residents, who are allowed to leave home only for food and medicines, not even a daily dose of outdoor exercise. “Without a doubt this pandemic is helping us improve air quality,” said Carolina Urrutia, Bogotá’s district environment secretary. “With the city shut down, we are able to focus our efforts on other environmental factors.”, Cali, Colombia’s third city and usually a smokey, congested metropolis, has also been spared from the usual forest fires, allowing residents to breathe fresher air. “The thick cloud that usually hangs over us has been lifted,” said Christian Camilo Villa, an air quality activist and Cali resident. “The concern is that it will return when the quarantine ends.”, Indeed, the fear among environmentalists and residents is that, rather than attempting to maintain the low levels of pollution in the world’s biggest capitals, when industry and cars kick back into action post-lockdown, the situation will go back to square one, and perhaps even worsen, as people and industry attempt to make up for the lost months., The signs from China, which is coming out of the other side of the coronavirus outbreak and where lockdowns are loosening up, are not positive. For the first four weeks after the Chinese new year holiday in late January, when the coronavirus outbreak was at its worst, pollution levels fell 25% across the country. But since early March, levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution have begun to inch back up as the country gets back to work with factories, businesses and power plants re-opening and traffic returning., Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said: “The big question is whether government stimulus measures lead to pollution levels rebounding above the levels before the crisis, like happened after the 2008 financial crisis.”positively alpine disbelief air pollution falls lockdown coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-645": {"text": "\nAustralia's booming LNG industry stalls after fall in oil prices amid coronavirus\n, More than $80bn of investment decisions are delayed due to a collapsed oil price and a geopolitical price war, \nAdam Morton Environment editor, \n\nSun 12 Apr 2020 19.55 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 12 Apr 2020 20.50 EDT\n\n, The extraordinary growth in Australia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry, the main cause of recent rises in national greenhouse gas emissions, has stalled indefinitely, with decisions on more than $80bn of investments delayed due to a collapsed oil price sunk by coronavirus and a geopolitical price war., The price of Brent crude oil is less than half what it was in early January, having fallen again on Friday despite the Opec oil cartel and its allies reaching a supply deal to stop Saudi Arabia and Russia flooding the world with more oil than it can use. The Asian spot price for LNG, which is linked to the oil benchmark, is down about two-thirds in six months., The unprecedented crash had already prompted oil and gas giants to defer investment decisions on projects including Woodside’s massive Burrup Hub expansion off the Western Australian coast and Santos’ $7bn Barossa project 300km north of Darwin. A decision on the first parts of the Burrup Hub expansion, including a $17bn development of the Scarborough gas field, has been pushed to 2021., Calls on Barossa and the largest section of the proposed Burrup Hub, a $30bn development of the untapped Browse gas field involving Woodside, Shell and BP, have been deferred to an unnamed date. In inland gas exploration, Origin Energy has paused exploration drilling for its unconventional gas project in Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin., Analysts said while prices were expected to rebound, the pace and scale of recovery were near impossible to forecast and may not reach the level required to justify new LNG investments for years, if at all. Climate activists said an extended delay was likely to make major new investments harder to justify as markets increasingly valued clean energy over fossil fuels., Peter Coleman, Woodside’s chief executive, told The Weekend Australian the industry was facing the worse situation he had seen and indicated the company’s projects were not guaranteed to go ahead. “I would suggest if we’re still sitting here in 12 months in the oil and gas industry in this difficult pricing situation then we’re going to have a fundamentally different industry and a fundamentally different view of how to create value,” he said., David Low, a senior analyst with consultants Wood Mackenzie, said its assessment remained that Scarborough and Barossa projects would be sanctioned next year, but both projects still had challenges to overcome related to ownership structure, and could have their timelines pushed out., “If oil prices are slow to recover, operators could opt to further delay discretionary spend and remain focused on strengthening their balance sheets. This will likely mean further delays for the Australian projects,” Low told The Guardian., Australia produces little oil, but its LNG industry has expanded dramatically since 2012 as developments have kicked off across the top end. It passed Qatar to become the world’s biggest exporter last year, with revenue reaching $51bn, placing it second to iron ore among the country’s resource and energy exports., Skyrocketing LNG production has added significantly to the country’s heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution. Its emissions in Australia (not counting those from burning the gas after it is shipped overseas) were up 16.9% in the year to September, all but cancelling out falls in emissions from electricity generation and agriculture as national emissions dipped just 0.4%., The Conservation Council of Western Australia estimated the Burrup Hub expansion alone could add nearly 20m tonnes to the country’s annual emissions, about 3.7% of the national total, if it were to go ahead in full. It could result in a further 80m tonnes a year when the gas was burned overseas., The fall in the oil price is yet to fully hit existing Australian gas projects as it takes about three months for changes in the crude benchmark to affect LNG contracts, but hundreds of oil and gas workers have been laid off or stood down as companies slashed planned investment this year., The oil price initially plummeted as Opec leader Saudi Arabia and Russia flooded the market, in part to undermine the US shale industry. Combined with the significant reduction in demand due to Covid-19 economic shutdown, it sent oil prices to their lowest level in 18 years. On Friday, the Saudi-led group known as Opec+ agreed to reduce oil supply by 10% to little immediate effect., Tom Swann, a senior researcher with the Australia Institute think tank, said a further complicating issue facing the oil and gas industry was the rising electrification of transport, which could lead to some investors rushing to get reserves out of the ground while there was a market to sell it into., “Those three trends together the pandemic, the geopolitical price war and electrification just mean there is chronic uncertainty in the industry, and that’s reflected in these companies share prices and investment decisions,” he said., He said future of the industry would depend in significant part on governments. “They could double down and try to pump prime more oil and gas, or we could seen investment in electric vehicles and charging stations,” Swann said., Tim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said whatever happened the price plunge meant Australia’s LNG industry was unlikely to ever again top $50bn in LNG exports. He said it would increasingly struggle to compete with renewable energy with a far lower marginal cost., Piers Verstegen, from the Conservation Council of WA, said the delays should be seen as an opportunity for companies to pause and pivot from carbon-intensive projects to clean industries, such as green hydrogen, which Woodside has indicated it sees as part of its future., “This gives everyone some breathing space,” he said. “They have been locked into a head on collision course with the global climate. This is their opportunity to change course.”australias booming lng industry stalls after fall in oil prices amid coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-646": {"text": "Ending logging in Victoria now would save taxpayers $192m, budget office estimates, The Greens asked officials to calculate the cost of shutting down the native forest timber industry immediately rather than 2030 as planned, Ending native forest logging in Victoria immediately, rather than phasing it out by 2030 as the state government plans, would save taxpayers $192m over the next decade, according to an estimate by the state’s independent budget office., The Victorian Greens asked the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) to calculate what it would cost to shut down the native forest timber industry in the state now, including bringing forward the government’s promised $120m transition package for the industry and workers., The assessment, seen by the Guardian, found there would be an overall $15.3m cost to the budget over the next three years as lost revenue and the cost of the transition package would outweigh savings from no longer paying grants to VicForests, the state-owned timber business., But across the decade it found the money saved from no longer keeping VicForests afloat would be far greater than forestry revenue. The officials calculated it would be expected to improve the state budget position by $191.9m by 2029-2030., Industry representatives and the state Liberal opposition said the PBO analysis was flawed as it did not include the cost of breaking timber supply contracts or redundancy packages for VicForests staff. They said it also did not consider the flow-on economic importance of VicForests’ funding for timber industries, particularly in regional communities, where thousands of jobs were at risk., The Victorian Greens’ environment spokeswoman, Ellen Sandell, said the PBO assessment was independent and showed the “huge cost to the public of destructive logging”. She said the money saved by stopping logging could be spent helping regional economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic., Sandell said given the devastating summer bushfires had pushed many animals and plants towards extinction, it was “criminal” the federal and state governments last week signed a 10-year extension to the regional forestry agreements covering logging in the state. “Ending native forest logging now, rather than in 10 years, will help both the environment and the economy,” she said., Victoria’s agriculture minister, Jaclyn Symes, said ending logging immediately would put “thousands” out of work before jobs were available in other forms of forest product manufacturing. She said the government’s policy would help businesses and workers move into jobs based on plantation timber as it became available later in the decade., The PBO analysis was commissioned after the premier, Dan Andrews, announced in November that the native forestry industry would be phased out over the next decade, starting with the immediate protection of 90,000 hectares of old-growth forest and 96,000 hectares of native forest set aside to save the threatened greater glider. Andrews warned the native timber supply was already down about 50% in a decade, and that a large bushfire such as that experienced over the summer that followed might hasten the industry’s end, but said forest supply agreements would be extended to 2024, when the $120m package would start rolling out., Bushfires burned at least 1.4m hectares in Victoria over summer. According to government assessments, they affected about 70% of the state’s remaining warm temperate rainforest and more than half the habitat of at least 170 rare and threatened species. The extent of the damage prompted calls for more forest to be protected from logging to give at-risk species a better chance of survival., The government plan was based in part on its expectation an extra 50,000 hectares of plantation forest would become available by 2030. Part of the industry package is earmarked to help mills invest in new equipment to process plantation timber., The Victorian Association of Forestry Industries, which opposes ending native forest logging, said the PBO had underestimated the true cost and not taken into account the economic activity that resulted from grants to VicForests., It cited a 2017 Deloitte Access Economics report, commissioned by VicForests, which suggested the industry then supported 2,526 jobs. A University of Canberra analysis for Forests and Wood Products Australia the following year said there were 1,639 primary processing jobs in native forestry and 2,894 in softwood and hardwood plantations., Jonathon Duniam, the Morrison government’s assistant minister for forestry, said the value of the native forestry industry was in the jobs and livelihoods it provided. “Communities and our economy are stronger when people are in work,” he said., Gary Blackwood, the state opposition forestry spokesman, said the PBO’s report was “absolutely flawed in every sense”. He said it did not appear to include the cost to the state of paying out supply contracts to sawmills, harvest and haul businesses and Australian Paper, and did not consider the impact of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity in the state., “By putting out a report like this the Parliamentary Budget Office has insulted every hard-working timber family in Victoria,” Blackwood said. ending logging in victoria now would save taxpayers 192m budget office estimates", "label": 0}, "train-647": {"text": "\nCarbon emissions from fossil fuels could fall by 2.5bn tonnes in 2020\n, Reduction of 5% would represent biggest drop in demand for industry on record, \nJillian Ambrose, \n\nSun 12 Apr 2020 08.34 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 13 Apr 2020 05.41 EDT\n\n, Global carbon emissions from the fossil fuel industry could fall by a record 2.5bn tonnes this year, a reduction of 5%, as the coronavirus pandemic triggers the biggest drop in demand for fossil fuels on record., The unprecedented restrictions on travel, work and industry due to the coronavirus is expected to cut billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic metres of gas and millions of tonnes of coal from the global energy system in 2020 alone, according to data commissioned by the Guardian., This would lead to the fossil fuel industry’s biggest drop in CO2 emissions on record, in a single year eclipsing the carbon slumps triggered by the largest recessions of the last 50 years combined., Climate experts expected global carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement production to rise in 2020, from an estimated 36.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide last year. Instead, emissions may fall by about 5%, or 2.5bn tonnes of CO2, to its lowest levels in about a decade., Dr Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, has warned against viewing the steep decline in emissions from fossil fuels as a climate triumph.,  “This decline is happening because of the economic meltdown in which thousands of people are losing their livelihoods, not as a result of the right government decisions in terms of climate policies,” he said., “The reason we want to see emissions decline is because we want a more livable planet and happier, healthier people.”, The fossil fuel analysis undertaken by Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consultancy, found a sharp contraction in GDP and the abrupt halt of flights and driving could cause the world’s oil demand to fall by more than five times the drop in demand triggered by the global financial crisis in 2008., The analysts estimate demand for crude will fall by an average of 11m barrels of oil a day this year, or 4bn barrels in total. This alone would cut 1.8bn tonnes of CO2 emissions, which would otherwise have contributed to the global climate crisis this year, according to Rystad., The analysts also expected a slump in electricity use and heavy industry to drive demand for gas and coal down by about 2.3% each, erasing carbon emissions from each fossil fuel by 200mtonnes and 500m tonnes respectively., Erik Holm Reiso, a senior partner at Rystad, said: “The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented event for energy markets, which will have a substantial impact on the world’s total carbon emissions., “The last time demand for oil contracted, during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day. But Covid-19 could cause oil demand to fall by more than five times as much.”, The unprecedented drop in oil demand will emerge in large part due the global aviation industry, he said. Typically there are about 99,700 commercial flights per day but the crackdown on non-essential travel to curb the spread of the virus could see air traffic fall by an average of almost a quarter over the year., Fewer cars on the road will also dent demand for petrol and diesel by an average of 9.4% over the year, shrinking oil demand in 2020 by an average of 2.6m barrels of oil a day., The analysts say the use of transport fuels may start recovering in the second half of the year, but found demand would lag the figures recorded last year., Energy demand in China, the world’s biggest importer of oil, is expected to begin recovering next month, four months after the outbreak in the Wuhan province. However it will not make a full return to normal levels until September at the earliest, according to Rystad. This could stoke a slow rise in global energy demand in the second half of 2020 but a recovery to 2019 levels is not forecast for this year., Resio said: “The real question is over the long-term impact of the virus. If we learn that remote working can work people may begin to question whether we need to take long haul flights to meet people in person. This could alter whether demand for oil ever recovers to the levels we have seen in previous years.”, However, Birol said if governments didn’t take the right measures to include support for clean energy in new economic stimulus packages “then this decline could be easily wiped out in the rebound of the economy”, once Covid-19 is brought under control., He said: “These figures are important and impressive. But they don’t make me happy.

The zone is burning,” he wrote in a Facebook post accompanied by a video of the blaze. Yemelianenko, a member of a public advisory board to Ukraine’s emergency service, also accused the government of covering up the severity of the fires., Ukraine’s emergency service on Monday said the fire was “difficult” but called for calm, saying all radiation levels in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, were normal and urging people not to listen to “apocalyptic messages”., “The main thing we can say is that there is no threat to the nuclear power station, the spent fuel storage, and to other critical sites in the exclusion zone,” the agency said., The agency said 310 firefighters and dozens of fire trucks, as well as three aircraft and three helicopters, had been deployed to extinguish the fire. The agency did not say exactly how far the fire was from the site of the former reactor or other sensitive sites., On Monday, a member of Greenpeace’s Russia branch told Reuters that the fires were larger than Ukraine’s official estimates and could pose a health risk., “A fire approaching a nuclear or hazardous radiation facility is always a risk,” Rashid Alimov, head of energy projects at Greenpeace Russia, told the agency., Fires have been burning since 4 April in Chernobyl’s exclusion zone, the 30-kilometre (18.6-mile) area around the former nuclear reactor where authorities have barred people from living., The fires were a result of locals setting fire to grass, police said. Ukraine’s parliament on Monday raised fines for grass arson to more than £4,500, an 18-fold increase adopted amid considerable public anger over the fires., The fires gained strength over the weekend due to strong winds. “At the moment, we cannot say the fire is contained,” Kateryna Pavlova, the acting head of the agency that oversees the area, told the New York Times on Saturday.ukraine wildfires close chernobyl nuclear site", "label": 0}, "train-649": {"text": "\nCountry diary 1920: the repeated call of the nuthatch\n, 13 April 1920 Repeating its signal again and again, in a few minutes an answering call came from the distant trees, \nThomas Coward, \n\nMon 13 Apr 2020 01.00 EDT\n\n, A clear, loud, trilling whistle, coming from a clump of ancient beeches, pleased but surprised me; it was the spring call of the nuthatch.

In a few minutes an answering call came from the distant trees, and, evidently satisfied, the nuthatch dropped to the foot of a beech and, mouse-like, ran to and fro upon the smooth bole., Round about Chester the bird is not uncommon, and until recently a pair or two occupied trees in Oulton Park, but within a few miles of Manchester it is casual. The return of the nuthatch to its long-forsaken home is a good sign; it pleased me more than the sight of a few swallows, flying with the sand martins, or of a large flock of fieldfares, halting for refreshment on their northward trail, though the fieldfare has been curiously rare this winter.

When confined by walls, fences, buildings, when confounded by civilisation, look up and feel your heart lift., The other day I looked up and saw an air ambulance in descent overhead, sunlit and cowslip-yellow, its downdraughts hammering the roofs of our mill town. I held my binoculars on it for a while – then noticed, beyond it, like a tiny smut on the lens, a buzzard, working a wide curve on the brink of sight., Our house has no garden, but it came with a lot of sky.

Strengthening the standards to 11 micrograms could save about 12,000 lives per year, according to one Harvard study of US seniors., Other research, noted in the government’s own analysis, found that maintaining the soot standard at its current level could allow as many as 52,000 deaths a year in just 47 urban areas., The Environmental Protection Agency is now proposing to to freeze the standards. The move comes as experts warn the coronavirus pandemic is unequally devastating communities of color that have been disproportionately burdened by pollution. It also follows the announcement of laxer fuel-efficiency rules for cars and other efforts by Trump to advance his political agenda before the November election., The agency is also retaining its current standard for coarse particle pollution., The EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler on a call with reporters argued that the agency’s science review “identified a number of uncertainties” and based on those believes that “the current standard remains protective and does not need to be changed.”, Rachel Fullmer, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund, said: “the administration’s effort to rush this action, without considering public input, is just the latest in a long line of attempts to ignore and undermine the science-based assessment required when the government establishes national standards.”, The US government is required to consider new science in evaluating whether air pollution rules are strong enough every five years., Wheeler disbanded the 26-member expert panel meant to review that research, appointing a smaller committee with less specific expertise in the pollutant to provide advice to the agency. Wheeler populated the committee with scientists from state-level agencies and industry – arguing they had long been underrepresented., EPA career staff have raised questions about whether the soot standard is protective enough, conflicting with the independent panel.trump epa soot pollution clean air standards", "label": 0}, "train-653": {"text": "Strengthen worldwide climate commitments to improve economy, study finds, Global economy could lose out by $600tn by end of century on current emissions targets, Every country in the world would be economically better off if all could agree to strengthen their commitments on the climate crisis through international cooperation, new research has found., But if countries go no further than their current CO2 pledges – which are too weak to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, and would lead to dangerous levels of global heating – then they face steep economic losses., The global economy would lose out by as much as $600tn (£476tn) by the end of the century, on current emissions targets, compared with its likely growth if countries meet the Paris goals, according to a paper published in the journal Nature Communications., If countries fail even to implement their current plans – which would lead to an estimated 3C (5.4F) of heating, far beyond the 2C or 1.5C settled on as the limit of safety in the 2015 Paris agreement – then the outlook is even worse, with losses of up to $800tn by 2100, according to the report from a group of scientists from the Beijing Institute of Technology and other mainly Chinese institutions., The study’s authors call their findings a “self-preservation strategy” for governments. They calculated the potential benefits by including the social welfare aspects of cutting emissions and of economic growth, which gives more weight than some other models to developing countries with large populations of poor and vulnerable people. They found that better international cooperation on emission would lead to better outcomes for such people, who are likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown., However, their findings also show such a strategy has greater benefits for developing countries with high emissions, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria and China, than for developed countries such as the US and the EU in the medium term, though all benefit in the longer term., Their findings come at a critical time for governments around the world grappling with the coronavirus crisis, and its dire economic impacts. Many are under pressure to ignore or roll back previous commitments on the climate, and some stricken industries with high emissions – such as airlines and carmakers – have lobbied for a weakening of green measures. Oil producers have called a truce in their price war., But reneging on green commitments now only stores up future problems, and will hasten climate breakdown, scientists have warned, and any respite from rising emissions caused by the crisis will be only temporary. All countries are supposed to come forward with improved national plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions this year, before vital UN climate talks aimed at keeping the Paris agreement on track., The UN and the UK government have been forced to delay the talks, called Cop26, until next year. That gives governments more time to improve their national plans, called nationally determined contributions in the UN jargon, but so far there is little sign they are doing so. Only Japan and Chile, the host of last year’s talks, among major countries have so far submitted fresh plans, and while Chile agreed to step up climate action, Japan’s plan showed no improvement., A UK government spokesperson for Cop26 told the Guardian: “We welcome Chile’s climate leadership as Cop25 president in submitting a strengthened emissions reduction target, and hope to see all countries following their lead.”, Current climate plans showed that the rich world must do more, said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Budgets should be rebalanced to provide emergency finance and help poorer nations – it’s the fair and right thing to do. If we don’t pay now, this is the kind of bill that, like a person ignoring a credit card statement, will only multiply in time. , “And it’s the kind of expenditure that repays multiple benefits and should really be seen as a smart investment. As if stopping climate change isn’t enough, it will deliver a better quality of life for more people around the world, faster.”, The economic benefits of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, compared with the high costs of reneging, should spur governments to act on the climate, according to the Nature study’s authors.

All the estuaries were acidifying., The study used data collected by field staff from the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment and covered five different types of estuaries – rivers, creeks, lakes and two kinds of lagoons., Lagoons warmed 3.65C over the 12 years and rivers warmed 2.79C, the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, found., The warming in estuaries was occurring at a much faster rate than the average warming in the atmosphere or in the oceans – demonstrating that impacts of warming were not uniform and some habitats could see more rapid change., The study said: “Our results highlight that air or ocean temperatures alone cannot be relied upon to estimate climate change in estuaries; rather, individual traits of any estuary need to be considered in the context of regional climate trends.”, The study did not try to directly link the warming in estuaries to climate change but the authors noted that temperatures in estuaries had risen against a backdrop of Australia’s changing climate., According to Bureau of Meteorology data, NSW has not had a year where temperatures were below average since 1997. The two hottest years on record were 2019 followed by 2018., Dr Elliot Scanes, a marine biologist at the University of Sydney and lead author of the study, told Guardian Australia that he was confident that global heating was partly to blame for the rising temperatures., He said the data showed that “climate change has arrived in Australia; it is not a projection based on modelling, but empirical data from more than a decade of investigation”., He said: “These sorts of affects have been anticipated, but maybe not at this rate. We have known that climate change will manifest in estuaries in some capacity., “This sort of rapid change could have negative effects for fisheries, but it’s going to be species specific.”, As well as rising air temperatures, a reduction in rainfall over the 12 years was also likely to have cut streamflow which meant the estuaries were shallower and more prone to heating., Prof Pauline Ross, of the University of Sydney’s School of Life and Environmental Sciences and a co-author of the study, said estuaries provided “immense ecological and economic value”., “The rates of change observed in the study may also jeopardise the viability of coastal vegetation such as mangroves and saltmarsh in the coming decades and reduce their capacity to mitigate storm damage and sea level rise.”, Dr Ben Henley, a climate scientist at Monash University who was not involved in the study, said: “This is an interesting study and a very useful dataset but I would caution against extrapolating long-term trends or attributing climate change from a 6 to 12 year record. Ongoing monitoring will be important to confirm the trends in these observations.”, The study also found that estuaries were acidifying with an average drop in pH of 0.5 between 2013 and 2019., The causes for this drop, said Scanes, were harder to understand but could be down to higher CO2 in the atmosphere and the lower rainfall reducing the exchange of waters between the oceans and estuaries, causing minerals to build up., Estuaries in eastern Australia tended to be shallower, but shared characteristics with many other regions of the world that were also experiencing warming and drying climates, the study said., Prof Perran Cook, of Monash University and an expert in estuaries and changes in coastal environments, said warming temperatures in estuaries would tend to lower oxygen levels in the water, increasing the risk of fish kills., But he cautioned that the study covered a relatively short time period. Australia’s climate was already variable and he questioned whether that 2C warming trend over just 12 years would continue., “That’s saying that estuaries would be 6C warmer (in 20 years’ time) and I find that hard to believe,” he said.water in estuaries along nsw coast has warmed by more than 2c study finds", "label": 0}, "train-655": {"text": "\nBeautiful, dangerous, damaged: photographers' top ocean shots\n, Beautiful, dangerous, damaged: photographers' top ocean shots, Octopus-hunting freedivers, mounds of shark fins, and a close encounter with a leopard seal are among the judges’ selections for Oceanographic Magazine’s ocean photography awards, open for entries until June 30, , \n\nTue 14 Apr 2020 02.00 EDT\n\n, Photograph: Shawn Heinrichs, Photograph: Paul Hilton, Photograph: Paul Nicklen, Photograph: Paul Hilton, Photograph: John Weller, Photograph: Cristina Mittermeier, Photograph: Shawn Heinrichs, Photograph: Luciano Candisani, Photograph: Luciano Candisani, Photograph: Paul Nicklen, Photograph: Andy Mann, Photograph: Cristina Mittermeierbeautiful dangerous damaged photographers top ocean shots", "label": 0}, "train-656": {"text": "\nCountry diary: fired up over brimstones\n, Billingshurst, West Sussex: These butterflies catch the light beautifully, and for a few moments it seems a broken fragment of the sun is sparkling over the grass, \nRob Yarham, \n\nTue 14 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, The warm yellow sun is sinking between the rooftops. Thin, white wisps of cloud sail through the blue sky.

Wings softly whirr as they fly back and forth from the branches to the feeders, to the tall alder tree outside the garden., Laughter floats over the walls, a child is bouncing a ball somewhere, a delivery truck passes. Jackdaws chuck as they fly over. Honeybees and bumblebees buzz as they visit the fading blooms of the dwarf cherry blossom tree beside me. Wood pigeons call softly to each other on rooftops.

Greenfinches have bred here in the past, but have been absent for four years, so I’m glad to see them return. There’s even a chiffchaff singing in the distance, somewhere on the edge of town. The lack of traffic on the nearby bypass and planes heading to Gatwick means I hear them all clearly this afternoon., Butterflies are also appearing more on these warmer days. A male orange-tip flew through earlier, and now a large yellow male brimstone flickers randomly across the bottom of the garden, catching the light, and for a few moments it seems a broken fragment of the sun is sparkling mid-air over the grass., The bright, butter-yellow male brimstones first emerge from hibernation in February, but the pale, white-green females come later, with the warmer days, their numbers reaching a peak in mid-April. They have one brood from mid-July, preferring areas where they can find their larval food plant – buckthorn, or alder buckthorn., The wandering, buttery butterfly, with its distinctive scalloped, leaf-shaped wings, rises over the brick wall and disappears.

The young tūturuatu have been … in a small quarantine aviary and, like us, are subject to stress when confined, but with more serious health implications,” he said., Death by territorial aggression or stress-related health problems were a very real possibility if the birds were not relocated immediately, said Anne Richardson, wildlife manager at the Isaac Conservation and Wildlife Trust, and the loss would have been a real blow after a successful breeding season., Strict Covid-19 lockdown regulations are in place country-wide, banning any non-essential domestic travel and international travel., A sole carer travelled with the shore plovers for each leg of the journey, and social distancing measures were carefully maintained at pick-up and drop-off points, as well as extensive use of PPE. The urgent relocation was personally approved by the conservation minister., “Getting the birds to Mana Island as soon as possible is the best outcome,” said Houston., Now the birds have arrived, they have a strong chance of survival, “Released juveniles are more likely to view the release site as their new home when they are in larger numbers,” Houston said. “The birds help to anchor each other to their release site.

She has a huge following, including her own Twitter account, as one of two social sharks for Ocearch., According to the team, their satellite tracking provider “did an in-depth analysis” to produce an “extremely rough estimate of where she might be”. Ocearch had been tracking the shark, as well as other great whites, along the north-west Atlantic coast., Scientists initially believed Katharine’s tracker had run out of batteries as the shark had not appeared on radar since May 2019. The tracker had been fitted seven years prior and batteries typically last five.,  “She’ll be bigger, significantly bigger and in particular, she’s much, much girthier,” Chris Fischer, Ocearch’s founder, told the Miami Herald. “She’s probably a very robust, mature female white shark in her productive prime.”, Naw, ya’ll my battery’s dead. But I am super fresh and super fly. #FinsUp #sharkgirl #sharkworld #NoRonaDownHere, While the data-based research company has been applauded by many for its contribution to peer-reviewed research on marine biology, Ocearch has faced criticism for its popularization of shark tracking., Some critics have alleged Ocearch’s methods border on exploitation, citing the company’s controversial partnerships with companies including SeaWorld., Fischer defended the company’s approach. In an interview with the New York Times, he questioned how research would be funded without its partnerships and apparel sales., “In the end, if we’re going to have an abundant ocean, why not get everybody involved?” he asked., Ocearch did not return a request for comment on its partnership with SeaWorld, the marine mammal park chain., However, according to SeaWorld’s website, the partnership includes “rescue, research, education and policy”, increasing consumers’ understanding of marine life “to save species and their habitats”., Great white sharks can grow up to 20ft in length.

Global heating is already at about 1C since the industrial revolution., The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said a “global response” was needed to tackle rising greenhouse gas emissions., She said: “For the average Australian and the average citizen of the world that cares deeply about the reef, this is our chance to shine and demonstrate that while we know climate change is the number one challenge to our reef, we also know there is much we can do to prepare the reef and put it in the best possible position for it to become as resilient as it needs to be.”, The feasibility study, led by AIMS, said: “Even if the world manages to stabilise global warming at 1.5C above the pre-industrial average, mass-bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. Critically, the reef’s resilience may already be significantly impaired.”, The study added: “In short, we are facing the very real prospect that, within a generation and without concerted action to reduce emissions and help drive adaptation and faster recovery from damage, the Great Barrier Reef as we have known it will cease to exist.”, Last week, the chief scientist of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Dr David Wachenfeld, told Guardian Australia that measures to improve the reef’s resilience were needed, but their success was underpinned by “dealing with the climate problem.”, Dr Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of AIMS, said the “best and brightest scientists” from across Australia had been brought together to work on the feasibility study., “What we have found is pretty profound. There is real hope for the reef,” he said., “RRAP is all about finding ways to help protect the reef from the effects of future warming and to prevent the kinds of bleaching that we have seen going on and to help damaged reefs recover.”, He said the research effort was “at the forefront of any science being done anywhere in the world”., Some methods previously discussed as having potential to lower temperatures on reefs during heat stress events – including using pumps and fans to circulate cooler deeper water onto shallower corals – have been ruled out for further research., But other concepts have been approved for further research in programs that will run over the next five to 10 years. They include:, Shading reefs by brightening clouds using nano-sized ocean salt crystals, or creating fog and mist over smaller reef areas, Using “micro-bubbles”, ultra-thin natural films and farmed algae to reduce light over smaller areas, Stabilising and enhancing damaged reef structures with mesh, frames, concrete shapes and 3D printed forms that could recreate the complexity of natural reefs, Dispersing slicks of natural and tank-raised coral larvae onto reefs, Breeding corals that are naturally more heat tolerant and then using their larvae in mass dispersal, David Mead, the AIMS director of strategic development, who helped coordinate the feasibility study, told Guardian Australia: “The outcome we want is to retain the fundamental resilience of the Great Barrier Reef., “This is to progress a broad range of ideas and some will get eliminated along the way.”, On cloud brightening, Mead explained the concept was to spray nano-sized droplets of salt water to increase the reflective capabilities of clouds., While the effect was “subtle” he said over a period of weeks initial modelling suggested it could keep water temperatures below the threshold where corals bleached., “It sounds scary and we need to do a lot of detailed studies on any downstream impacts,” he said., The feasibility study also estimated the annual cost of the 43 different concepts being researched. While the costs seemed high – cloud brightening, for example, would cost an estimated $158m a year – Mead said the benefits were also very large., The study modelled likely benefits from deploying the interventions, which ranged from $10.7bn over 60 years to figures in the hundreds of billions., But the cost benefits from deploying the measures were dependent on future greenhouse gas emissions and diminished as temperatures went higher., Hardisty said the study had shown it was “technically feasible to act at scale” but he said “it’s going to be a combination of measures applied at different scales and in different areas that will work together to achieve real success.”, He said: “If we can get the science right and intervene on the reef at scale to prevent this kind of damage and build that resilience, then the benefits for Australia environmentally, socially and economically, especially for reef communities, is going to be in the tens of billions of dollars.”, Anna Marsden, managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, said the feasibility study had shown that 71% of the Australian public supported large-scale efforts to help reefs adapt.brightening clouds and coral larvae study picks best great barrier reef rescue ideas", "label": 0}, "train-660": {"text": "\n‘Mixed with prejudice’: calls for ban on ‘wet’ markets misguided, experts argue\n, Cultural nuance and wider view of supply chain ignored in debate following Covid-19 outbreak, say those proposing regulation over ban, \nMichael Standaert in Shenzhen, \n\nWed 15 Apr 2020 07.59 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 15 Apr 2020 08.39 EDT\n\n, Attacks and calls to ban “wet markets” because of their potential for spreading diseases such as Covid-19 may be missing the point, say experts., Earlier this week Sir Paul McCartney, a long-time vegetarian campaigner, called wet markets “medieval” and said that it made sense to ban them. “When you’ve got the obscenity of some of the stuff that’s going on there and what comes out of it, they might as well be letting off atomic bombs. It’s affecting the whole world.”, Last week more than 60 US lawmakers called for a global ban on what are referred to interchangeably as “live wildlife markets” or “wet markets”. And animal welfare groups have also been calling for a ban., According to US lawmakers: “‘Wet’ markets in particular pose a threat to global public health because wildlife comes from many different locations without any standardised sanitary or health inspection processes.”, Animal Equality argues that the markets are not only “inhumane” and a source of “intensive suffering inflicted on farmed animals”, but that they are also a “threat to public health”., But experts who know the markets well say that they are just one link in a chain of both legal and illicit wildlife trade that needs intensive regulation, monitoring and enforcement to reduce heath risks, demand and consumption. , In China, much of Asia, and some other parts of the world, a “wet market” is a term used for any market where fresh meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, and other perishable goods, are sold in an open-air setting. The “wet” part comes from sellers sloshing water on produce to keep it cool and fresh., While the markets may be considered unsanitary by western standards, most wet markets in China do not sell live animals other than fish in tanks, or sometimes in open pools., Many markets in China stopped selling live poultry after widespread avian flu outbreaks led provinces and local governments to ban such sales over the past decade., And while it is rare to see wildlife sold in these markets, the practice has continued in poorly regulated sites, such as the now-infamous Wuhan South China Seafood Market, which was suspected to be a primary source for spreading Covid-19 during late 2019., “If we really want to prevent future pandemics, we have to do a lot more than just stop live wildlife being slaughtered at markets or wild meat being sold at markets,” Debbie Banks, head of the tiger campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the Guardian., “In some countries, wildlife is commercially harvested and commercially farmed and transported direct to restaurants, consumed at private banquets, and used in traditional medicine, so there is a need to address demand and other retail venues besides wet markets,” she said., Using terms such as “wet markets” in debates on the issue also risks further stoking misconceptions and cultural prejudices, argue some., “This call for a ban comes from cultural differences often mixed with prejudice,” Kartini Samon, a Jakarta-based campaigner with the nonprofit Grain who has studied wet markets in the region, told the Guardian. “Wet markets are very common and have a long history in many places in Asia.”, The Wuhan market was closed on 1 January. Authorities in China placed a temporary ban on all trade in wildlife in late January, including any trade in wildlife to be consumed for meat, to be used in traditional medicine, and for fur and other purposes., Further fine-tuning of the laws and regulations around the trade is ongoing. But it is the regulatory environment that allowed for such trade at the Wuhan market and the networks that supplied it that needs to be addressed, say experts, not simply the existence of the markets themselves., Across many countries wet markets provide an important outlet for small farmers to sell their produce, said Samon. “In a country like India or Indonesia, between 25 and 40 million people rely on wet markets and informal food vendors for their livelihoods.”, And while markets like Wuhan’s may be an outlier for their trade in live wildlife, others say that more needs to be done to address general sanitation and hygiene at wet markets., “That means setting standards and sticking to them and having strict enforcement measures against practices that could transmit illness and disease. That is more sensible than shutting them down, which won’t be consistently enforceable,” said Dirk Pfeiffer, chair professor at City University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences in Hong Kong., Pfeiffer believes that over time many wet markets will disappear in places like China due to changes in consumer preferences and convenience., Some supermarkets already try to replicate a “mini-wet market” atmosphere with a butcher available under familiar reddish lighting for shoppers to chat with about which cuts are more fresh in a way that is harder to do in larger, impersonal, brightly-lit supermarkets., “I do think that wet markets are an issue when it comes to food safety standards and to adverse environmental impact. But that can be dealt with by regulation and raising awareness among consumers and traders,” Pfeiffer said., “We need to focus on changing the demand, because as long as that is there it will be a way for people to trade in wild animals and their products,” he said.mixed with prejudice calls for ban on wet markets misguided experts argue coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-661": {"text": "\nPandemic shines harsh light on Trump's failure to protect pangolins\n, Wildlife conservation efforts are essential to preventing outbreaks, scientists and advocates say, \nJimmy Tobias, \n\nWed 15 Apr 2020 06.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 15 Apr 2020 06.02 EDT\n\n, For more than five years, wildlife conservationists in the US have been clamoring for the government to provide Endangered Species Act protections to pangolins, a group of imperiled ant-eating mammals that are widely, and often illicitly, trafficked for their scales and meat. The Trump administration, however, has refused to act and that refusal has suddenly taken on grave new implications., Earlier this year, scientists in China identified pangolins, along with bats, as one of the possible animal hosts involved in the transmission of the deadly coronavirus from wildlife to humans., Although there is still much uncertainty about the nature of the disease’s emergence, the unwillingness of the Trump administration, and the Obama administration before it, to provide legal protections to pangolins, and other species, has intensified scrutiny of America’s faltering role in international wildlife conservation efforts. Scientists and advocates say these are essential to preventing the kind of pandemic currently sweeping the globe., Though no pangolins live in the US, an endangered species designation could make additional funding available to preserve the species, bolster efforts to crack down on illegal trade and send a powerful signal to the international community that the animals ought to be protected., Like HIV, Sars and Ebola before it, the coronavirus that is wreaking devastation worldwide is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it spilled over from animals to humans. It is widely believed that the disease originated in bats and was transmitted to humans in a live animal market in Wuhan, China, where a variety of animals mixed amid a bustling human crowd., Pangolins, which harbor coronaviruses similar to the one that causes Covid-19, may have played a role in the virus’s mutation and transmission to humans, though this theory remains in question., What scientists know for certain is that the emergence of such zoonotic diseases occurs when humans disrupt healthy ecosystems, invade wildlife habitat, and trade and traffic in wild animals, whether bats, pangolins, birds, rodents or civets, a type of cat-like mammal that is often illegally trafficked and played a role in transmitting Sars to humans in the early 2000s. In this way, they expose themselves to deadly new pathogens, said Dr Jonathan Epstein, a vice-president at the EcoHealth Alliance, an organization dedicated to protecting wildlife and preventing zoonotic diseases., “When ecosystems start to get disrupted, when we increase our contact with wildlife, that is when we see more opportunity for pathogens to jump from their wild animal reservoirs into domestic animals or humans,” Epstein said., A 2017 study found that a “majority of emerging infectious diseases (and almost all recent pandemics) originate in animals, mostly wildlife”, as a result of interactions with people and livestock., The US has historically been a global leader in the creation and the promotion of the kind of wildlife conservation efforts that may help prevent the emergence of new diseases. The US passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973, and it played a seminal role in the 1973 signing of the Cites treaty, which erected an international framework for the protection of imperiled animals and plants., Under the Trump administration, however, the US has abandoned its leadership role in this arena, and critics say that the administration’s faltering commitment couldn’t have happened at a worse moment., “It is not like any one thing would have stopped this pandemic, so you can’t make that generalization,” said Brett Hartl, the government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “But if the US were actually a leader in international wildlife conservation like it used to be back in the day and actually took its obligations seriously and was putting real pressure on trafficking and countries like China to stop decimation of pangolins and other species, who knows where we would be today.”, The Trump administration has presided over a broad rollback of wildlife conservation measures in recent years, weakening the Endangered Species Act enforcement and slowing the number of species added to the endangered list each year. And it has sought to slash the budget of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the country’s principal wildlife agency, which investigates wildlife traffickers and protects imperiled species at home and abroad., The Trump administration also wants to cut more than $300m from programs run by the state department and USAid that promote habitat conservation and combat wildlife trafficking in Asia, Africa and elsewhere, according to a February report from the US Global Leadership Coalition. In light of threats such as Covid-19 and the climate crisis, the report asserts, the administration’s proposed cuts are “out of touch with America’s interests”., Covid-19, scientists and advocates argue, has proven that this is not a time to reduce the US’s commitments to protecting and restoring the world’s ailing animal populations., “As we have seen with this virus, every country is part of an interconnected world,” said Dr Barney Long, the senior director of species conservation at the group Global Wildlife Conservation., “The wildlife trade is not a ‘China problem’,” he noted. “We have to act as one global community rather than individual countries or we are not going to break through these issues.”coronavirus pangolins protections us trading", "label": 0}, "train-662": {"text": "\nSelf-isolating animals: eight species that have mastered social distancing\n, Self-isolating animals: eight species that have mastered social distancing, WWF has compiled a list of animal species whose social behaviours make them self-isolation experts.

It is late January 2020, and the Slovenian film-maker is just one of about 800,000 people who have visited Boulders Beach on South Africa’s Cape Peninsula every year to get up close to these charismatic flightless birds., At Boulders, just over an hour’s drive south of central Cape Town, African penguins swim, loaf around and breed within a few metres of visitors, who can even get into the water with them. Penguins normally nest on offshore islands, but this small beach is surrounded by houses which form a barrier to land-based predators such as caracal lynxes and baboons, making it a “pseudo island” where the birds feel safe. They have bred here since the early 1980s, and it’s now part of the Table Mountain national park., A visit to Boulders and its penguins is a high point of many South Africa trips, but the idyllic #bouldersbeach images that brighten more than 100,000 Instagram accounts mask a blunt fact: Spheniscus demersus is rapidly heading into extinction., The species, which only breeds in South Africa and neighbouring Namibia, numbered about 1.5–3 million in the early 20th century. That dropped to 300,000 by 1956, and the numbers kept on falling. In 2018, just 15,000 pairs were found breeding in South Africa, and last year that slumped further to 13,300 pairs. About 5,500 pairs may still breed in Namibia, according to Namibian biologist Jessica Kemper, but no recent surveys have been done there., Because only about 2% of its former population remains, the species is classified as  endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. A 2018 study predicts the “functional extinction” of African penguins from the west coast of South Africa by 2035 if current patterns are maintained., Christina Hagen of BirdLife South Africa says the main cause of the penguin’s dramatic decline in recent decades is the lack of nutritious small fish – sardines and anchovies – left in the right areas of the ocean. Decades of overfishing off the south-west coast of Africa, once one of the world’s richest fishing grounds and where the vast majority of penguin nesting islands are, have demolished many fish stocks., “The jellyfish are thriving, though, and that’s a bad sign,” says Kemper of the Namibian waters where huge numbers of seabirds used to feed on fish. Ocean warming appears to have pushed many of the remaining small pelagic fish away from the west coast to areas off the south coast of South Africa, where there are very few islands., Nesting penguins starve if there are too few nutritious fish near breeding colonies; the parents can’t hunt farther than 40km, at most, from the nest if they are to feed their young regularly. So Hagen and colleagues are pushing the traditional conservation envelope by trying to establish a new penguin colony on a stretch of the south coast of South Africa that has no offshore islands but is near some of the last remaining sardine stocks., They identified a small headland in De Hoop nature reserve and turned it into a pseudo island by cutting it off from the mainland with a predator-proof fence. In January last year they stocked it with skilfully made concrete replicas of penguins along with speakers playing penguin calls to try to lure passing birds into nesting there., While this could be considered a mild form of assisted migration, the often controversial practice of moving species to new areas so they can keep up with changing environmental conditions, in this case the penguins are not being moved outside of their natural range, but are being encouraged to create a new breeding colony about 100km away from the nearest natural one., So far the fake penguins haven’t persuaded any wild birds to set up home in the new pseudo island, but Hagen will soon release young penguins from a Cape Town rehabilitation centre into De Hoop in the hope that this will lead them to breed there some years down the line, as penguins tend to breed at the places where they were raised., But even if penguins breed at the new site and their youngsters leave the nest healthy and well-nourished, a large percentage still might not make it to maturity. Research has shown that the typical behaviour of young African penguins is not compatible with a warming, overexploited ocean., Adult African penguins prefer to hunt in groups because it is far more efficient than hunting alone. These adults aggressively exclude inexperienced, first-year birds – who are easily identified by their blue-grey plumage – from fishing parties so they do not disrupt the hunt., So the young birds move away until they are of breeding age. Researchers who satellite-tracked young penguins found that they tend to move long distances from their original colonies – sometimes more than 1,000km – mostly to cooler, nutrient-rich areas of the ocean that historically were rich in small fish, but where numbers are now low., Young penguins that spend their first years off the west coast of southern Africa, where fish stocks have collapsed most seriously, are far more likely to starve than those that go south and east, where fish stocks are healthier. It appears that young penguins are falling into what scientists from the University of Exeter and the University of Cape Town refer to as an “ecological trap”, and this explains much of the overall population collapse. Even if birds breed at the new colony, their offspring might also fall into this trap., Conservationists are now fighting on many fronts to keep African penguins alive, pointing out that thousands of other species are dependent on them and the cash they bring in from visitors. National park entry fees at Boulders Beach raised more than 72m rand (£3.2m) in 2018-2019, helping to make Table Mountain one of South Africa’s few parks to turn a profit and in turn subsididsing other parks in this megadiverse country. Since the Covid-19 outbreak and consequent shutdown of all South Africa’s national parks, this income has – at least temporarily – disappeared., BirdLife South Africa is working with the South African government to declare no-fishing zones around penguin colonies and juvenile feeding areas, but the process is slow and complicated, says Hagen., But even if fishing stopped in the areas where sardines and anchovies were once abundant, stocks might not recover. Ecological “state shifts” may have occurred, so that species such as jellyfish and gobies have moved in, for example, making it hard for sardines to reoccupy their place in the system even if they are no longer fished., Hagen is not giving up on the birds, though. “I’m cautiously hopeful that if all the conservation measures we’re putting in place are successful, the penguins will survive,” she says., Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresdecoy tactics can fake concrete penguins help save the real thing aoe", "label": 0}, "train-664": {"text": "\nCountry diary: this lofty tree is a pandemic survivor\n, Crook, County Durham: Once as quintessentially English as a Constable painting, wych elms have been laid low by disease, \nPhil Gates, \n\nWed 15 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, The wych elm, Ulmus glabra, tall as a two-storey house, arching over the lane, had been hiding in plain sight. We must have walked under it scores of times but hadn’t paid attention until today, when its flowering canopy, with starbursts of crimson stamens clustered along every twig, stopped us in our tracks., Such sights had been a distant memory. When I was a child in the 1950s, lofty English elms, U procera, home to a cacophonous rookery, cast shade over the barns on the farm in Sussex where my grandmother worked. In the 1970s, when we lived in Warwickshire, rows of giant elms were the guardians of field boundaries, as quintessentially English as a Constable painting., And then, in little over a decade, they were nearly all gone, laid low by a virulent strain of the fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, Dutch elm disease, originating in Asia but characterised by mycologists in the Netherlands. The pandemic was transmitted via elm bark beetles but was carried across continents by the timber trade, attacking almost every Ulmus species in its path. Laid low, because it didn’t kill the trees outright. Trunks died but roots survived, sprouting suckers that succumbed again when their girth was sufficient to attract bark beetles., Suckering makes elms easy to propagate quickly from cuttings, a tendency exploited by the Romans for raising saplings that supported their vines. Genetic research in Spain in 2004 demonstrated that when the legions invaded Britain, and vineyards were established, they introduced U procera to the English flora, importing a single seed-sterile Iberian clone. Two millennia later, it proved uniformly vulnerable to the devastating fungal pathogen., As we stood underneath our wych elm, a gentle shower of stamens fell on to the road; tree sparrows were feeding on the flowers. Nationally, the population of these chestnut-crowned finches has fallen by more than 90% since 1970, but is now recovering. I see them almost as often as house sparrows. They have adapted to life in gardens, and nest in ours., We walked home reflecting on vulnerability, resilience and genetic diversity, nature’s insurance policy in times of adversity. The adaptability it confers on tree sparrows may be reversing their decline; uniformity in elms guaranteed their eventual downfall.country diary this lofty tree is a pandemic survivor", "label": 0}, "train-665": {"text": "\n'Like a spiral UFO': world's longest animal discovered in Australian waters\n, Along with up to 30 new marine species, scientists have found a 150-ft example of a siphonophore, a string-like deep-sea predator, Ian Evans, \n\nWed 15 Apr 2020 00.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 10.37 EDT\n\n, Scientists exploring the deep sea off Australia’s coast have discovered as many as 30 new marine species – and what may be the longest animal ever seen., The discoveries were the result of expeditions into Western Australia’s underwater canyons. One of the biggest discoveries was a siphonophore measuring an estimated 150 feet (46 metres). Siphonophores are deep-sea predators made up of many small clones that act together as one and spread out like a single long string in the water. Researchers think this particular siphonophore may be the longest yet found., The expedition also collected a number of other deep-sea animals that the researchers suspected had not yet been documented, including an octopus squid, a long-tailed sea cucumber, glass sponges and the first giant hydroids – a colony of animals that looks like an upside-down jellyfish – ever seen in Australia., Nerida Wilson, a senior research scientist at the Western Australia Museum, who led the expedition, said the discovery of the extra-long siphonophore came when many researchers on board were least expecting it. The research vehicle dived as deep as 4,439 metres, but the siphonophore was only discovered as the vehicle was making its way back to the surface at around 630 metres., “Most scientists had drifted out of the control room,” Wilson said. “The word soon spread and people came pouring into the control room to share the excitement. It was just amazing to see this huge organism spread out like a spiral UFO, hovering in the water column. We couldn’t believe what we were seeing.”, Siphonophores, like jellyfish, feed by dangling stinging tentacles in the water. Small crustaceans and fish unlucky enough to swim into this curtain of tentacles are paralyzed and reeled up to the body of the colony., The new siphonophore was about twice as long as many blue whales, and three times as long as a humpback whale, which usually grow to around 50ft long., The expedition was led by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, a non-profit group that supports oceanographic research, including the provision of a research vessel and remotely operated vehicle, which the Australian government and scientific institutions otherwise lack., The discovery of the siphonophore and other possibly unknown species was made in a protected area known as the Gascoyne Coast bioregion. This highlights what Wilson described as “one of the disconnects between where we are with ocean conservation and knowledge”., “While it’s a protected area, we actually have no idea what lives there,” she said. “We really wanted to reveal the incredible biodiversity that is there.”, Wilson acknowledged it will be months or years before researchers will be sure that the organisms they discovered are new to science. “We were definitely looking for and expecting new species,” she said. “Those waters were just too unexplored to not yield such treasures.”like a spiral ufo worlds longest animal discovered in australian waters", "label": 0}, "train-666": {"text": "\n'Nature is still there': UK diary project heralds spring during lockdown\n, Scores of amateur writers describe the arrival of new season in fields and gardens, \nSteven Morris, \n\nThu 16 Apr 2020 19.01 EDT\n\n, Some wrote in praise of the signs of spring glimpsed through windows or from balconies while others focused on the birds, the bees and the unfurling leaves spotted during outings for permitted exercise., Scores of amateur authors have taken part in a spring nature diary project to document the early days of the new season, with most clearly taking solace and finding some hope in flora and fauna at this most challenging of times., The 150-word pieces were collected by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the National Trust and the Land Lines research project, which is investigating the history of nature writing in the UK., People of all ages submitted entries from towns, cities and villages.

Several other researchers, including an EmiControls representative, were unable to join the crew as planned because of Covid-19 travel restrictions., A separate vessel 5km away carrying atmospheric modelling equipment was able to detect the mist created by the prototype. Future experiments will measure if the salt particles do brighten clouds., The cloud-brightening approach is just one of 43 concepts being funded under a $150m government-backed research and development program announced on Thursday., Scientists are racing to find measures that could be used to reduce the impact of rising ocean temperatures on corals caused by global heating., In 2020, the Great Barrier Reef experienced its third outbreak of mass coral bleaching in five years. Tropical coral reefs are especially sensitive to global heating. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says 70-90% of coral reefs will die as global heating gets to 1.5C., Harrison said the technology, deployed in March under a permit from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, had promise because it was relatively cheap, could be deployed at scale and kick-started a process that occurs naturally., “Nature does most of the work for you,” he said. “This makes a nano-sized salt crystal at hundreds of trillions per second. They get into a cloud and grow a cloud droplet that reflects a lot more sunlight.”, Harrison said the technique was effectively boosting a natural process, because clouds mostly form over the ocean when moisture gathers around salt crystals stirred up by winds from the ocean surface., He said while a cloud of mist was visible off the back of the boat, about 99% of the particles created by the nozzles were too small to see. However, they could be detected by atmospheric measuring equipment on the accompanying vessel. , “We thought we might only be able to detect it a couple of kilometres downwind, but we detected it 5km downwind,” Harrison said., Scientists on the barge said they could see corals “bleaching around us” as they carried out the experiment., Harrison and the core team drove 3,600km north to Townsville from Coffs Harbour, and back, camping and preparing their own food along the way to remain isolated from others not involved in the project as Covid-19 travel restrictions began to be rolled out., Future research will also examine any downstream risks from the technique, and any local impacts on rainfall., Manduburra traditional owner Usop Drahm, who joined the expedition, said: “We welcome scientific research where Indigenous people and the rest of Australia work together to maintain the reef ecosystem for future generations., “This technology might help prevent bleaching and we like that it uses no chemicals and relies on natural processes.”, Harrison said while the trial was not set up to detect if clouds had been brightened, “the theory says the particles would have mixed up to the heights of low-level clouds about 800 metres up”., The salt crystals would have remained in the air for only one or two days in the initial experiment, he said. The approach does not make clouds, but brightens those already in the atmosphere., There are plans to scale up the experiment using more and larger turbines so that their output is about 10 times larger., This, Harrison said, could cover an area of hundreds of square kilometres – a scale large enough to slightly cool ocean temperatures., Within four years, Harrison said, it was hoped the project would show a brightening response in the clouds., But he said the success of such projects would depend on action to cut greenhouse gas emissions., He said as temperatures went up, the cloud brightening technique became less and less effective at protecting corals from mass bleaching.scientists trial cloud brightening equipment to shade and cool great barrier reef", "label": 0}, "train-668": {"text": "\nCan cloud-brightening help save the Great Barrier Reef?

There does seem to be a real swell of support from people to do this.”, She said workers who had been furloughed were allowed to top up their income through farm work, and many others who had lost their jobs would see it as a lifeline, as well as a way to help the country through the coronavirus crisis., Workers have been flown in this week on charter flights from Romania, despite travel restrictions and fears for their health and safety. Germany has also been recruiting farm workers by air from eastern Europe. About 80,000 workers are likely to be needed this year, leading to calls for a “land army” of paid workers to join farms., Batters said there was still time for more people to sign up, as the critical period for the UK’s harvest would not begin until next month. “We will know much more when we get to May,” she said., However, even if the labour shortages are less severe than some have predicted, farmers across the country are still facing a struggle to stay in business as their supply chains have been turned upside down by the coronavirus crisis., For farmers, the biggest single problem is that before the lockdown about half of the food consumed in the UK was eaten outside the home, in cafes, restaurants and pubs. Now they are closed, supermarkets are struggling to keep up with demand for grocery shopping, but farmers used to supplying the catering trade have few ways of getting their produce to consumers. “It is very difficult, if not impossible, to switch,” said Batters., Food must meet different standards when sold through supermarkets, and adapting the supply chain takes longer than farmers have to sell their perishable produce. “If you’re a potato farmer, and you sold to fish and chip shops, you can’t just start selling your produce direct. You can sell some at the end of the farm drive, but that’s only going to make a small difference,” said Batters., Ministers have been slow to act, said Martin Lines, chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. “We have heard very little from the government on how they will be supporting farmers to effectively make this transition and we urge them to look at appropriate ways to deliver a clear food delivery strategy that supports short, sustainable supply chains during the pandemic and beyond,” he said., Selling directly to consumers remains difficult, even for farmers who have set up their business that way. Charlie Cole, a livestock farmer at Broughgammon farm in Northern Ireland, said: “It’s been an absolute nightmare. Our business is completely dependent on us selling directly to the customer. So now that the government restrictions are in place, the farmers’ markets and street food events have come to a close and we’ve had to shut the cafe in the farm shop, which are all usually reliable sources of income.”, The cancellation of Wimbledon means its strawberry supplier in Kent is faced with 33 tonnes of perishable soft fruit with no market. Marion Regan, whose great-grandfather established Hugh Lowe Farms in Kent in 1893 with a Covent Garden stall, is now looking at alternatives. “We will find a home for them,” she told the Oxford Farming Conference podcast. She said she was talking to food banks as well as commercial outlets., The difference between what we eat at home and our tastes when eating out is also causing problems. Our love of mince is a menace to livestock farmers, who have seen the meat market collapse even while supermarkets have been stocking their shelves with meat imported from Poland. People are eating far more mince, which is cheap and comes from the tougher end of the animal, instead of the more expensive cuts, such as steak, that we tend to choose when eating out., As farmers need to sell whole carcasses, they are forced to sell at far below the true value. “If everyone wants mince, the carcass is massively devalued,” said Batters. “People want to buy British beef. If it has to be mince, OK, but you must balance the carcass if necessary by mincing prime cuts and stabilise the price, or people will go out of business.”, Coffee shops used to account for a large proportion of the UK’s fresh milk sales, but when drinking at home people tend not to make the milky cappuccinos and lattes that they would buy when out. Dairy farmers are seeing prices so low that some have been throwing fresh milk down the drain without a buyer to collect it from the farm., Supermarkets imposed buying limits to stop people stocking up on some items, including milk and eggs. But Batters said there was no reason for limiting the amount of dairy produce people can purchase as there was no shortage of supply., Small farmers were most at risk from the crisis, Batters warned, as they had less to fall back on and were finding it hard to gain credit extensions from their banks., Farmers who diversified, as they were urged to, into side businesses such as running B&amp;Bs are also finding those sources drying up. “Normally we would make £7,000 off tourism per year, but that income is going to vanish,” said Polly Davies, a tenant farmer in Glamorgan., Batters will urge ministers at a virtual meeting on Friday to give British farmers a boost by mandating all food bought by public bodies, including the NHS and the army, to come from British producers., “The government has a key role to play, that needs to be recognised,” she said. “If there is to be a positive legacy from this crisis, let’s build a more resilient economic future – paying attention to our food and our health, and buying local food, is a key part of that.”farmers union optimistic uk workers will rescue the harvest covid 19", "label": 0}, "train-670": {"text": "\nUS to have major floods on daily basis unless sea-level rise is curbed – study\n, \nOliver Milman, \n\nThu 16 Apr 2020 11.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 14.25 EDT\n\n, Flooding events that now occur in America once in a lifetime could become a daily occurrence along the vast majority of the US coastline if sea level rise is not curbed, according to a new study that warns the advancing tides will “radically redefine the coastline of the 21st century”., The research finds major cities such as Honolulu, New Orleans and Miami will become increasingly vulnerable to elevated high tides and stronger storms fueled by the global heating caused by human activity. Beach and cliff erosion will exacerbate this situation., The accelerating pace of sea level rise means that by the end of the century floods currently considered once in a lifetime, or once every 50 years or so, will become a daily high tide occurrence for more than 90% of the coastal locations assessed by researchers from the US government, the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Hawaii., Within 30 years from now, these now-rare flooding events will become annual occurrences for more than 70% of the locations along the US coast according to the research published in Scientific Reports. This scenario threatens huge, multibillion-dollar damages and, potentially, the viability of some coastal communities., “If future sea-level rise causes once extreme but rare floods to occur frequently then … this may render some parts of the US coastline uninhabitable,” said Sean Vitousek, a scientist at the US Geological Survey., The disruption caused by frequent flooding will threaten the habitability of much of the US coastline as it is already widely projected to do to many low-lying islands in the Pacific, Vitousek added., The paper uses an analysis of extreme water levels across more than 200 tide gauges along the US coastline, along with models of future sea level rise that depend on the amount of heat-trapping gases countries pump into the atmosphere through power generation, transportation and other activities., While small changes in the level of the sea may seem inconsequential, the researchers found that 5-10cm of sea level rise can double the chances of flooding, with most coastal locations around the US experiencing a doubling of extreme flooding events every decade this century., Global sea levels have increased by about eight inches on average since 1880, although some places along the US coast have experienced higher rates than this. The seas are expected, on average, to rise by at least another foot by the end of the century even if emissions are constrained.

Spotting them is one way to identify common species, but why not try learning their songs, too? That’s not as easy as it sounds: rather like learning a foreign language, it can be pretty daunting. But with patience, time and effort, it can be done – just follow these simple steps:, 1 Sit in your garden if you have one, or take your daily walk, either early in the morning or during the hour or so before sunset, when the volume and intensity of birdsong is at its peak., 2 Listen to the bird first; then try to get a good look at it, to help you identify the species., 3 Use mnemonics (see below) to help you remember which bird makes which sound., 4 Focus on only one or two species each day. Then, when you get home, listen to recordings of their songs, and when you go out the next day, try to hear them again., 5 As Bill Oddie says, think about the rhythm, tone and pitch of each song: fast or leisurely; cross or plaintive; high, low or medium pitch?, Remember, practice makes perfect – and you’ll never have a better opportunity than now!, Sparrow-sized, with a black head, white cheeks, a green back and a black stripe down the front. It sings a syncopated “tea-cher, tea-cher” song: hence “the teacher bird”., Listen here to the great tit, Small and perky, with blue and yellow plumage, and white cheeks. Its song is not very tuneful; it always sounds rather cross., Listen here to the blue tit, Tiny and round, with a long tail sticking out behind like a flying lollipop. Makes a variety of high-pitched calls – “see-see-see” – and a soft farting sound., Listen here to the long-tailed tit, In terms of appearance, the male does what it says on the tin; the female is brown. Its song is deep and fluty in tone, and very measured in pace and rhythm., Listen here to the blackbird, The classic thrush, with brown back and spotted breast. Its song consists of repeated phrases, as if the bird is conducting a one-sided conversation., Listen here to the song thrush, Unmistakable, perky and plump with that famous red breast – both males and females. The song is delicate and measured, with each phrase followed by a pause., Listen here to the robin, Once called the hedge sparrow, the dunnock is dark greyish-purple and brown, with a thin bill. Its song is a rather unremarkable series of warbling notes., Listen here to the dunnock, Tiny, plump and chestnut-brown, with a cocked tail and short, whirring wings. The wren is amazingly loud for its size, producing a high-pitched, trilling song., Listen here to the wren, A small, slender, olive-green warbler that sings its own name: “chiff-chaff-chiff-chiff-chaff”, often pumping its tail up and down while doing so., Listen here to the chiffchaff, A robin-sized warbler: grey with a black cap (male) and chestnut cap (female). Its tuneful, powerful song sounds like a speeded up robin., Listen here to the blackcap, Britain’s smallest bird, weighing the same as a 20p coin. Tiny, plump and green with a gold flash on the crown. Fast, rhythmic song., Listen here to the goldcrest, A slender, graceful, black-and-white bird with a long, permanently wagging tail. It feeds on the ground and calls “chis-ick” in flight – hence “the Chiswick Flyover”., Listen here to the pied wagtail, Superbly sleek and slender bird found in rural areas, with a long, forked tail and broad, triangular wings. Light, warbling song. Back in early April., Listen here to the swallow, Shorter and more compact than a swallow, the house martin is found in urban areas. Looking like a miniature killer whale, it twitters in flight. Back mid-April., Listen here to the house martin, The swift has a cigar-shaped body and long, scythe-like wings, with all-dark plumage. Flocks tear across city skylines, screaming as they go. Back in late April or early May., Listen here to the swift, The classic sound of spring, yet rarely heard nowadays, even in former haunts. It looks like a hawk: slender, long-tailed, with long, curved wings. Sings its name., Listen here to the cuckoo, The male is smart with a pink breast, grey head and white wingbars; the female has the same pattern, but lacks colour. Its song sounds like a cricketer running up to bowl, with a flourish at the end., Listen here to the chaffinch, A small, brightly coloured finch with black and buff plumage, a red face and gold flashes on the wings. Light, fast and tuneful song., Listen here to the goldfinch, The male is bright green with yellow wing flashes; the female is duller green. They produce a wheezy song, often delivered in slow, circular flight., Listen here to the greenfinch, Once common, now missing from many places. The male has a grey crown and black bib; the female is duller brown.

They are not.”, Donald Trump is continuing to push for border wall construction amid the pandemic, and in mid-March, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced plans to build another 150 miles. Yet officials are alarmed by the impact on the workers and the rural border towns they are interacting with and, at times, living in., Numerous residents in Ajo complained to the Guardian of construction workers having parties and coming into stores in groups as large as 20., “As the rest of the country shuts down to stop the spread of Covid-19, construction crews continue building Trump’s vanity wall with billions of dollars in stolen funds,” said the Arizona congressman Raúl Grijalva. “The presence of large construction crews in small border towns threatens the health of those communities where they are already underprepared to deal with the coming public health emergency.”, Throughout the Covid-19 crisis, Trump has rationalized border wall construction as a way to contain the spread of the disease., “The Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans,” he said at a rally in South Carolina. “Now, you see it with the coronavirus.”, Public health experts say these claims have little basis, because the virus is not spreading into the US from Mexico – it is already spreading within US communities., In Columbus, New Mexico, a so-called “man camp” was erected last week in the middle of town to house wall construction workers., “Of course I am concerned,” the Columbus mayor, Esequiel Salas, told the Guardian by phone. Last week, the mayor sent a letter to SLSCO, the wall-construction company operating the camp, “to request that they could hold off their move into the man camp until 16 April at the least”, he said., This issue is particularly acute in rural border towns where access to healthcare is sparse. “This move is honestly infuriating,” said Johana Bencomo, executive director of the faith-based border community organization NM Cafe. “To put at risk communities like Columbus, places that lack infrastructure and healthcare facilities, is so offensive,” she said., In Ajo, many workers live in town, occupying the RV parks, hotels and rental houses., “They are bringing people as far away as places like Nebraska and Montana,” said Gail Emrick, executive director of the Southeast Arizona Area Health Education Center in Nogales. “It’s just bringing an irrational level of danger to these communities.”, Many of the workers travel home on weekends to their families and communities. , According to Emily Siegel, the owner of the Sonoran Desert Inn and Conference Center in Ajo, the presence of the workers in town is “uncomfortable”., “Our entire reason for being here is to convene people,” said Siegel, who, along with her husband, decided to close in the center in mid-March, “the busiest time of the year”, to protect their staff, guests and the town. “We made the decision early. We realized we had a responsibility not to convene.”, In late March, a resident of Ajo who declined to give their name said they were delivering supplies to a friend when they passed by a house rented to the construction workers. “The backyard was lit up, music was blaring, and they were throwing horseshoes,” said the person, describing the get-together of “10 or more people”., The army corps of engineers, the agency responsible for overseeing contractors on the border, has said that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on social distancing are being followed on the border., A border wall construction worker named Steve Allen  said in the community Facebook forum “Ajo Speaks” that employees were not tested for Covid-19 but their temperatures were checked daily., He also said, however, that some workers lived three people to a house, carpooled to the construction site, and had on at least one occasion gathered at one another’s homes. ., “Three guys invite a friend and you have six people pretty easy,” he noted.trump border wall coronavirus pandemic ajo arizona", "label": 0}, "train-673": {"text": "\nUK school and hospital caterers vow to cut meat served by 20%\n, Public sector pledge said to target removal of 9m kg of meat a year from UK meals, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nThu 16 Apr 2020 03.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 15.30 EDT\n\n, Public sector caterers serving billions of meals a year in schools, universities, hospitals and care homes have pledged to cut the amount of meat they serve by 20%., The caterers’ meals are eaten by a quarter of the UK population and the groups said their action was aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving the healthiness of meals. Industry experts called the move unprecedented., People in rich nations, such as Britain, eat more meat than is considered to be healthy. Studies have also shown that meat consumption must be slashed to tackle the climate emergency and other environmental crises such as water pollution arising from the high impact of livestock., International studies have suggested cuts of up to 90% are needed, but in January the UK’s official climate change advisers recommended a 20% consumption reduction., The #20percentlessmeat pledge was launched in the trade magazine Public Sector Catering., David Foad, editor-in-chief of the magazine, said: “It represents a bold move, because it is not being mandated. It would have been much easier to sit back and wait until they were either prompted or forced into action like this by government.”, Some experts have suggested meat taxes are needed to bring about change., Foad said that attaining the 20% target would remove 9m kg of meat from plates every year, equivalent to 45,000 cows or 16 million chickens., Andy Jones, who chairs the PSC100 group of caterers and suppliers working to improve the health of meals, and is also a former chair of the Hospital Caterers Association (HCA), said: “The carbon emissions savings and the potential benefit to people’s health can play a part in tackling climate change and shortening NHS queues.”, The HCA has signed up to the pledge. Craig Smith, the association’s chair, told Public Sector Catering that the people it served were already moving away from meat. “The biggest rise we are seeing is those demanding a more plant-based diet.”, Matt White, chair of the University Caterers Organisation, said: “We are fully committed to the #20percentlessmeat initiative. We have a very short window of opportunity to make changes in the way we all eat or we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and to future generations.”, The National Association of Care Catering has also backed the move, but its chair, Sue Cawthray, said it would require work to implement. “I would say our biggest challenge to meeting the 20% target is the mindset of many of those currently in care homes. The majority would have been brought up on a staple diet of meat and veg and will be resistant to change.”, Stephen Forster, chair of LACA, (the Local Authority Caterers Association), which represents 3,300 school food providers, said: “The school food industry is leading the way on meat reduction. Schools across the country have meat-free days and are increasingly introducing plant-based vegetarian and vegan options. We therefore support the campaign.”, Philip Mansbridge, director at the campaign group ProVeg UK, said: “Never has the public sector made a commitment of this magnitude. By making simple and effective adaptations, all public sector caterers will soon find more of their meals are healthier, more planet-friendly and equally or more delicious.”, Jones said: “The huge range of people we feed every day means we can influence the diet of the nation. I, for one, don’t want to be known as part of the generation that could have acted, even in a small way, but did nothing.”school and hospital caterers vow to cut meat served by 20", "label": 0}, "train-674": {"text": "\nHalf UK's true carbon footprint created abroad, research finds\n, Half of real carbon footprint comes from ‘invisible’ cost of goods made overseas – study, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nThu 16 Apr 2020 02.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 04.16 EDT\n\n, The UK’s efforts to cut greenhouse gases are being undermined by a failure to put in place climate policies that cover imported goods, research has found., The government is committed to cutting the UK’s carbon output to net zero by 2050, and emissions have been falling for the past three decades. But that does not take into account the “invisible” side of Britain’s carbon footprint, which comes from international travel and the carbon produced overseas to make goods that are used here., About half of Britain’s true carbon footprint is made up of these sources, according to a report from the conservation charity WWF., Emissions associated with imports to the UK, including international travel, have risen from about 316m tonnes of carbon in 1990 to 360m tonnes in 2016 and 358m tonnes in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. These imported emissions can vary substantially from year to year, but have been broadly steady or rising, though they are down from a peak of 449m in 2007, before the financial crisis., Over the same period, between 1990 and 2016, the UK’s own carbon emissions fell by more than 40%, thanks mainly to a long switch away from coal-fired power to gas and renewable sources of electricity, according to the report published on Thursday., The carbon associated with the manufacture of imported goods appears in the carbon accounts of the manufacturing country. However, some countries have less stringent carbon targets than others, and developing countries may struggle to use low-carbon methods as they pursue economic growth. International aviation is not covered by countries’ national carbon targets, under the UN climate talks and the Paris agreement., “If all other countries were going for net zero too, then this invisible carbon footprint wouldn’t be a problem,” said the author of the report, John Barrett, a professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Leeds. “The UK should be showing leadership.”, Policies to ensure that goods allowed to be imported had a lower carbon footprint – such as requirements on the efficiency, repairability and recycling of electric and electronic goods – could have a major impact on the invisible side of Britain’s carbon footprint, he added. Exporters would have an incentive to reduce their carbon footprint and the emissions associated with using their goods., Other changes to people’s habits could also bear fruit, for instance, encouraging a move to a healthier diet with more vegetables and less meat could change food imports and the carbon associated with them, said Barrett., The question of how to account for the emissions associated with imports is a vexed and polarising one, with some green campaigners arguing that developed countries should accept responsibility for emissions generated overseas, while other economists point out that the manufacturing countries have been paid for the goods., Josh Burke, a policy fellow at the Grantham research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the report, said: “Using consumption accounting to understand trade flows is a useful exercise in light of the current global disruptions to supply chains and geopolitical tensions that have seen trade walls erected. Policies to shift consumption patterns and lower imports emissions – such as border carbon adjustments – are an elegant economic solution, based on equity and efficiency, rather than protectionism.”, The EU is considering such border adjustments – in effect, carbon taxes on imports – to take into account the carbon generated by their manufacture, as part of its European green deal. But this is complex, said Burke. Such policies “tend to get bogged down in the politics of implementation and discussions often get sucked backed into protectionist agendas. As the UK begins to negotiate a raft of new free trade agreements, the optics of such a policy may in fact hinder international cooperation.”, The UK will host the next UN climate talks, originally set for November in Glasgow but delayed to next year by the coronavirus crisis. This gives ministers the opportunity to encourage other countries to bring forward strong plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and to offer assistance to poor countries that could benefit by building their low-carbon export sectors, according to Stephen Cornelius, the chief climate adviser at WWF., “We should not be avoiding imports, but we should help other countries to reduce their carbon intensity,” he said. “The UK should work with other countries to bring forward high-ambition plans” under the Paris agreement., Barrett warned that ministers could be tempted, in drawing up plans for the economy to recover from the virus crisis, to pursue trade deals at any cost, without regard to their environmental impacts. “We have the option to improve standards, to encourage a low-carbon economy, or a race to the bottom,” he said. “That would undermine our environmental and social capital.”, The UK’s domestic emissions fall under the Climate Change Act, under which the government must meet carbon budgets set out by the independent Committee on Climate Change several years in advance., The CCC has recommended that the UK continue to base its commitments on its “territorial” emissions, as this is the agreed international practice, but also keep track of emissions based on the consumption of goods from overseas and the implications of that trade.britain climate efforts undermined failure imports carbon", "label": 0}, "train-675": {"text": "\nCountry diary: wandering deer share our self-isolation enclave\n, St Dominic, Tamar valley: Woken at dawn by the sound of a cock pheasant’s crowing call and vigorous wing flapping, I look down on three roe, \nVirginia Spiers, \n\nThu 16 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, Deer roam through the garden most nights, leaving their prints and grazing choice leaves of daylilies, Hemerocallis, among swathes of poisonous monkshood. The first sighting was at dusk, when two bounded downhill through shadowy fruit trees, white rumps prominent in the fading light. More recently, woken at dawn by the sound of a cock pheasant’s crowing call and vigorous wing flapping, I look down on three roe, wandering beneath the fading blooms of magnolia before heading towards dense cover in the Radland valley., This morning, in broad daylight, when the excitable songs of summer-visiting chiffchaff and blackcap outdo those of resident birds whose earlier chorus has subsided, two emboldened deer stroll nearby; they skirt the fruit cage, pass under clusters of blossom on the Burcombe cherry and tread daintily among cowslips and false oxlips, seeded from plugs planted in the grass 15 years ago., During these strange days we are privileged to live in this cherished enclave of orchard, regenerating woodland and ever wilder garden; in the quietness of self-isolation, we are acutely aware of the creatures that share this haven. Warmth and sunshine bring out holly blue, brimstone and orange-tip butterflies; buzzards glide above the tallest leafing trees and draw attention to flowering oaks, only slightly earlier than the ash. Fortunately, we can nurture a patch of winter-planted brassica, lettuce and spinach in the tunnel, protected from the nibbling rabbits that wreak much damage to old hedge banks along narrow lanes, where the burrowed, loosened earth slumps to the footings before erosion by the next bout of heavy rain., Across the hedge to the north, a neighbouring farmer’s 11 rams have been moved off the tight-grazed, hard ground to fresh land. Lengthening grass gleams on the southern skyline where fields are shut in preparation for the first silage cut. Nearer, on the opposite side of the little tributary that flows towards the Tamar, South Devon yearlings spread across their summer pastures and the farmer’s butchery reports ever-increasing demand for this home-produced meat. Come evening, a group of these handsome reddish-brown cattle gathers for a last warm-up around the trunk of a huge oak, temporarily side-lit by the setting sun.country diary wandering deer share our self isolation enclave", "label": 0}, "train-676": {"text": "\nMajor blow to Keystone XL pipeline as judge revokes key permit\n, Campaigners welcomed Wednesday’s ruling as a victory for tribal rights and environmental protection, \nNina Lakhani in New York, \n\nWed 15 Apr 2020 21.33 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 08.48 EDT\n\n, The controversial Keystone XL tar sands pipeline has been dealt a major setback, after a judge revoked a key permit issued by the US army corps of engineers without properly assessing the impact on endangered species., In a legal challenge brought by a coalition of environmental groups, a federal judge in Montana ordered the army corps to suspend all filling and dredging activities until it conducts formal consultations compliant with the Endangered Species Act., The ruling revokes the water-crossing permit needed to complete construction of the pipeline, and is expected to cause major delays to the divisive project., Keystone XL is a 1,179-mile pipeline which would transport around 830,000 barrels of oil a day from the tar sands in Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska, eventually heading to refineries on the Gulf coast., Campaigners welcomed Wednesday’s ruling as a victory for tribal rights and environmental protection., “The court has rightfully ruled against the Trump administration’s efforts to fast-track this nasty pipeline at any cost. We won’t allow fossil fuel corporations and backdoor politicians to violate the laws that protect people and the planet,” said Tamara Toles O’Laughlin of the environmental group 350.org, Judith LeBlanc, director of the Native Organizer Alliance, said: “The revoking of the permit is a victory for treaty rights and democracy. Tribal nations have a renewed opportunity to exercise our legal and inherent rights to protect the water of the Missouri river bioregion for all who live, farm and work on the land.”, The Keystone XL pipeline was approved in 2010 by the Canadian national energy board, but suspended in 2015 after Barack Obama refused to grant the required presidential permits amid growing public outcry from a coalition of Native Americans, First Nations, ranchers and farmers, and environmentalists., Donald Trump issued the permits within days of taking office, stipulating only that American steel be used in the work., Construction began earlier this month in Montana after the company TC Energy Corp secured $1.1bn in financing from the Canadian provincial government of Alberta to cover construction through 2020 – and agreements for the transport of 575,000 barrels of oil daily., In a statement, the Canadian company said it was reviewing the judgment: “We remain committed to building this important energy infrastructure project.”, The company faces a separate legal challenge on Thursday 16 April, when tribal communities will be back in court requesting an injunction to stop construction in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The court will decide whether construction, which the plaintiffs argue will bring thousands of out-of-state workers to remote areas already ill-equipped to deal with the public health crisis, should be suspended.keystone xl pipeline montana judge environment", "label": 0}, "train-677": {"text": "\nRebuild it, shade it, breed it: three tactics to buy time for the Great Barrier Reef\n, While emissions reduction is the only long-term solution, scientists are testing ways to keep the reef going in a warming world, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nFri 17 Apr 2020 16.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 00.00 EDT\n\n, Can the world’s greatest coral reef system be rescued from the rapid march of the climate crisis?, With global temperatures already about 1C higher than pre-industrial levels, Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef has been through three mass bleaching events in only five years., Corals are dying and the system is changing rapidly as temperatures keep going up and greenhouse gases keep accumulating in the atmosphere., Earlier this week, the Australian government revealed a $150m research and development program to build the reef’s resilience to future warming., Ken Anthony, a principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: “It’s a bit like the Apollo 11 mission. It really is on that scale. We have to be able to look Australians in the eye in in 10 years’ time and say that in the time we had, we did our best.”, On its own, the project – called the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program – is a clear signal that scientists now know cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to sustain a vibrant reef., It’s time for intervention at a scale never seen before, scientists say, and they’re in a race against time to find enough solutions before climate change bites even harder., Some 43 concepts are being backed under the plan, from futuristic cloud brightening to using concrete blocks to stabilise damaged reefs., The program has split the concepts into seven groups and scientists say none of them will be enough in isolation – it’s more likely that a combination deployed at different scales will give the reef the best chance. These seven categories fall broadly into three approaches:, Shading and cooling reefs to cut sunlight or lower ocean temperatures;, Stabilising and rebuilding reef structures damaged from bleaching, cyclones or ocean acidification;, Helping corals adapt to warmer temperatures and then moving their larvae around en masse., So what’s being planned, and could these approaches really buy the reef enough time?, In early March, Daniel Harrison, a biological oceanographer at Southern Cross University, led a trial of equipment that sprays trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air., The idea is the salt crystals reach existing low-level clouds and, because of their tiny size, encourage the formation of smaller cloud droplets that reflect more sunlight than larger droplets., The process mirrors what happens over the oceans every day as winds carry salty ocean spray into the air to help form clouds., Harrison is leading a project to try to scale-up the trial to see if clouds over hundreds of kilometres could be brightened. If this was possible, the brightening effect could slightly lower ocean temperatures below – perhaps keeping corals just cool enough to prevent them from bleaching., Such a system could be turned on and off quickly, and could be deployed when weather forecasts and models show that corals are under dangerous levels of heat stress., Harrison, who is leading the cooling and shading efforts under the government program, says: “It’s a combination of light and temperature that causes corals to bleach., “We are pursuing the things that are really big in scale, but also looking at small scale actions that could support outcomes on a local level at high value reef sites.”, Other methods under this “shading and cooling” category include machines to create artificial low-hanging sea fog that could provide shade over smaller areas. Researchers are also looking at ultra-thin reflective films that could temporarily cut the sunlight over small areas., “This is a race against time,” he said. “If we can go really hard on emissions and meet or beat the Paris climate targets, then these interventions have the potential to help get the reef to a sustainable future – but only under that very aggressive emissions reduction scenario.”, Anyone who has walked around an ancient Roman city will have seen restorers working behind steel props and scaffolding that hold up what’s left of a once majestic temple or amphitheatre., Coral bleaching and cyclones can weaken the structure of reefs, known as the substrate. Scientists think that if reefs could be stabilised, it might give other methods a chance to take hold and restore individual reefs., There are question marks over the economics of deploying mesh or 3D printed frames at scale, but the restoration programs suggest there could be small-scale deployments that could help reefs recover., Removing natural rubble around reefs could also help create space for new corals to grow, and is another area under investigation., Modelling for the program found these approaches tended to only be cost effective if emissions in the future were very low. But they could still help at smaller scales., Anthony says if temperatures stay below 2C “then there is so much we can do” across all the approaches., “It’s both daunting to look at the challenge ahead, but also we know we have to come up with a plan,” he says., “At 3C the reef will look very different – it would be a sad story, but you still wouldn’t give up.”, Prof Peter Harrison, at Southern Cross University, is a global expert on how coals reproduce and was among the first to discover their mass spawning on just a few nights of the year after full moons., “It’s like an underwater snowstorm and billions of eggs and sperm get released,” he says., One approach under development is to find ways to capture larvae during natural spawning and then move them in “slicks” and drop them in places that need help to recover., Harrison says there is always masses of excess coral larvae that would float away or be eaten and, before the impacts of climate change, “it didn’t matter if 99% of the larvae drifted away or got eaten fish, because there were so many of them.”, “Because the production of larvae has been so dramatically impacted because of the mass bleaching, we are now looking to see how we could use what we know about coral reproduction and more effectively transfer them onto damaged reef systems.”, Harrison says methods being researched under the new program include scaling up floating ocean pools to transfer coral larvae, or eggs and sperm raised in aquaculture ponds, onto reefs., Corals get much of their colour and nutrients from the symbiotic relationship they have with special algae. Harrison says that some corals are more heat tolerant than others, and the same goes for the algae., Combining heat tolerant algae and heat tolerant corals, and then producing more heat tolerant larvae, could give reefs “more scope for growth under warming conditions”., “We think we can get an increased tolerance of corals of just a few degrees. Ultimately, unless the political leadership round the world enables a realistic approach to managing greenhouse gas emissions and bringing the rate of climate change under control, the system will become so overwhelmed we won’t be able to use these corals., “We are buying time to help coral species to evolve and adapt and buy enough time to get some real action on climate change. There’s a large group of people around me who feel we can’t wait for action. We have to work out what we can do now.”rebuild it shade it breed it three tactics to buy time for the great barrier reef", "label": 0}, "train-678": {"text": "\n'Nature is enjoying itself without us': coronavirus frees nature in Lebanon – video\n, Nature experts in Lebanon have noticed cleaner and clearer air filled with migratory birds as Beirut remains under lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic., Migrating pelicans are flying over the city as environmentalists say birds seem to be venturing closer to urban areas , \n\nFri 17 Apr 2020 15.49 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 18 Apr 2020 10.37 EDT\n\nnature is enjoying itself without us coronavirus frees nature in lebanon video", "label": 0}, "train-679": {"text": "\nThe week in wildlife – in pictures\n, The week in wildlife – in pictures, The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including bald eagles and roaming wild boar, , \n\nFri 17 Apr 2020 11.29 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 17 Apr 2020 11.30 EDT\n\n, Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters, Photograph: Arizona Department of Game and Fish/AP, Photograph: Robin Loznak/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock, Photograph: Carlos Ortega/EPA, Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA, Photograph: Virginia Mayo/AP, Photograph: Jiji Press/EPA, Photograph: Oded Balilty/AP, Photograph: Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission/AP, Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images, Photograph: Joaquín Sarmiento/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Emerson Utracik/Rex/Shutterstock, Photograph: Courtesy of Schmidt Ocean Institute, Photograph: Cristina Mittermeier, Photograph: Adam Welz, Photograph: Attila Kovács/EPA, Photograph: Emmanuel Rondeau/WWF, Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA, Photograph: Isaac Kasamani/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Department of Conservation, New Zealand, Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock, Photograph: David Gannon/AFP via Getty Imagesthe week in wildlife in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-680": {"text": "\nBritish workers reject fruit-picking jobs as Romanians flown in\n, Contract length, farm location and caring duties cited as reasons for turning down work, \nLisa O'Carroll, \n\nFri 17 Apr 2020 10.22 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 17 Apr 2020 12.48 EDT\n\n, Thousands of British workers who responded to a nationwide appeal to help pick fruit and vegetables on farms have rejected job offers, it has emerged., As hundreds of workers are being flown in from Romania to pick lettuce and asparagus, specialist recruitment firms revealed that fewer than 20% of the applicants were either willing or able to take up roles on the farms., The Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers said it had received 36,000 applications of interest but only 6,000 had opted for an interview for a role., Concordia, one of the three recruitment companies in the alliance, said: “To date 900 people have explicitly rejected the roles we have offered and 112 have taken up our offer of a role on a UK farm.”, It said the main barriers were the length of the contract, location of the farm, and inability to work full-time because of care responsibilities., Another recruitment firm in the alliance, Hops, said only 9% of those who had completed the recruitment process were eligible for the job., People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:, Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:, Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed., “Some are saying they cannot commit to 40 hours a week, some can only commit for a few weeks whereas some roles can be full time for eight weeks and some can be up to six months,” said Sarah Boparan, the operations director at Hops., She said that even though they were not able to hire all who applied, she felt there was an education process under way about farm work that could have a lasting impact after Brexit, when Conservative party plans will put a block on low-paid and low-skilled workers coming to the UK from abroad., “We are so pleased to see so many people apply and so thankful they have responded to the call to support agriculture in this country and we appreciate their patience as some of the crops are not yet ready and new offers will be going out,” she said, adding that peak recruitment would not really start till the end of May for most farms., Several people who said they had responded to the government-backed appeal complained about the barriers to taking up the posts, particularly the on-site accommodation., One man who contacted the Guardian, who lives in Norfolk and wanted to commute to a job locally, where there are many farms, said: “Some of the jobs require you to live on-site. It doesn’t make it easy at all. If we really need to be picking all these vegetables, they don’t make it very easy. I can’t move; I have a family.”, Gary Leshone, 35, who used to work in fishing in Grimsby, launched his own personal recruitment drive when the national Feed the Nation appeal, backed by the environment secretary, George Eustice, was launched three weeks ago., He managed to get 150 volunteers who were willing to cross the country to Herefordshire and to live on-site for six months., “I contacted farmers individually and initially I was told by one farmer he’d take as many workers as he could get, so I went on radio and social media and got 150 people. I know I could probably find 1,000 to 2,000 here because people are out of work.”, He was then told by the farmer that he needed a gangmaster’s licence if he was going to place that many workers on the market, which he was told would take 10 weeks to obtain., “By that time the fruit and veg will have rotted and the borders will probably be reopened,” he said., Underlining the confused messaging surrounding the sudden recruitment drive, Hops pointed out that the Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority was doing checks and handing out gangmaster licences within five days because of the crisis., “The Romanians coming in are just like us, looking for work to feed their families themselves, but if they need 90,000 people and you have all these British people unemployed and the government has to pay out universal credit, it’s just ridiculous. The government should do more to sort this out,” said Leshone., Recruiters appealed for patience among British hopefuls, pointing out that the peak season started from May and there would be “thousands of roles available for people who are in need of a job”., There was controversy in Romania after photographs emerged of crowds gathering in regional airports for flights to Germany, which, like the UK, is also suffering a labour deficit. Questions are being asked in Romania as to how workers could leave to help ease other countries’ demand for fresh food when much of Romania is in strict lockdown., G’s Fresh, one of the UK’s biggest salad growers, which has chartered two of the six planes from Bucharest, said it had recruited 500 British workers so far., “We’re really pleased with how the recruitment campaign is going, but it is important that we have got these people from Romania. These are key skilled workers who were with us last year. We need experienced people who can make sure everyone is safe and knows what to do,” Beverley Dixon, the company’s HR director, told Eastern Daily Press., Romanian workers travelling to the UK were given masks and sanitiser before boarding and would be be quarantined in small teams before full deployment, G’s Fresh said.british workers reject fruit picking jobs as romanians flown in coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-681": {"text": "\nFalconers to be allowed to take wild peregrine chicks from nests\n, UK wildlife watchdog under fire as conservationists say decision ‘sends wrong message’, \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nFri 17 Apr 2020 09.35 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 17 Apr 2020 12.09 EDT\n\n, Conservationists have condemned the decision to allow falconers to take wild peregrine falcon chicks from nests as “selfish” and “sending the wrong message”., For the first time ever this year, Natural England, the government’s wildlife watchdog, will allow the taking of six chicks from peregrine nests to help falconers establish a lucrative new “studbook” of British falcons., Peregrine falcons – the fastest species on the planet, reaching more than 200mph during dives for prey – were threatened with extinction as a breeding bird in the 1970s. Numbers have recovered to 826 breeding pairs in England, with many nesting on cathedrals and tall buildings in cities, where they are free from persecution., The RSPB said it was “urgently” seeking answers from Natural England about how it made its decision and feared the licence could “open the door” to more applications., Mark Thomas, the RSPB’s head of investigations, said: “The cultural value of these birds is that they are free, wild and available to all. The application will therefore be regarded by many as selfish – it should be reconsidered in light of alternative solutions, and in the context that peregrines suffer from illegal persecution, trade and loss of breeding range.”, While all nesting birds are legally protected, licensing the removal of chicks for falconry is permitted under wildlife laws. Falconers argue that their current captive birds are not verifiably British birds and EU regulations permit the sustainable use of species for cultural purposes., Unesco recognises falconry as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity” and the ancient practice is increasingly lucrative, with birds changing hands for as much as £6,000 to supply the sport of falcon-racing in the Middle East. Three falconers will remove chicks from nests in England, although they will not be allowed to do so in parts of northern England where the peregrine is still threatened., Natural England said its licence would only allow a chick to be taken from a nest where there were three or more chicks present. The falconers must only take the smallest, weakest chick, which would not ordinarily survive in the wild. It said it would be “closely monitoring the operation” and could revoke the two-year licence at any time., One falconer behind the attempt to establish a captive population of indisputably British birds, Gary Wing, told Mark Avery’s blog that there was “no commercial interest” in the scheme, which would be costly for falconers to establish., Until the introduction of DNA testing of captive birds in the 1990s, peregrines were regularly and illegally taken from the wild., David Lindo, a conservationist known as “the urban birder”, said he was dismayed at the decision., “It sends the wrong message,” he said. “We’ve got enough birds in captivity. If you’re going to be doing falconry, use the birds in captivity. What is wrong with them? Someone is making money from this somewhere along the line – what sort of message does this send around Europe and the Middle East? It validates the idea that the peregrine is not a species in decline and we can take some more from the wild.”, Jade Emery, wildlife campaigner for Animal Aid, said it was “a huge step backwards” for wild bird protection., She said: “While Natural England attempt to dignify falconry by describing it as ‘an ancient tradition’, it is in fact just outdated. Taking animals from the wild and subjugating them for entertainment or sport is fundamentally wrong, should be consigned to history, and is certainly not something that should be supported by Natural England. The wellbeing of these majestic birds should be prioritised over this outdated and cruel hobby, and this decision should be quickly reversed.”, Dr Gordon Mellor, chairman of falconry organisation the Hawk Board, said: “Falconers across the world have controlled access to wild populations of raptors following the principles of sustainable use. In this respect UK authorities are following established conservation practice., “UK wildlife legislation is predicated upon the need to conserve and protect wild populations. Given that the peregrine population is currently buoyant, the taking of limited numbers will have no impact upon the wellbeing of that species in the wild.”falconers to be allowed to take wild peregrine chicks from nests", "label": 0}, "train-682": {"text": "'We’re watching them die': can right whales pull back from the brink?, \n'We’re watching them die': can right whales pull back from the brink?\n, Dedicated conservationists are striving to save the North Atlantic right whale – believed to be down to 400 individuals as ships and fishing gear take their toll, by  Megan Mayhew Bergman, \n\nFri 17 Apr 2020 05.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 14.49 EDT\n\n, “You can’t work on North Atlantic right whales and be a pessimist,” Clay George tells me. He’s a senior wildlife biologist and right whale specialist at Georgia’s department of natural resources, and one of the only people in the south formally trained to disentangle a whale from fishing gear., Right whales are known to spend most of their time near the surface of the water, feeding and socializing. This behavior leaves them vulnerable to boat strikes and entanglement in fishing lines, almost exclusively the cause of their deaths., There are so few North Atlantic right whales left in the world’s oceans – estimates hover around 400 – that many are known entities to the scientists who devote their careers to saving them. They often identify them by the patterns of callosity on their heads, raised tissue colored white by an infestation of cyamids, commonly known as “whale lice”., I want to know if George feels any optimism at the slight uptick in calving in 2020, as 10 were seen in calving grounds this winter. There were zero calves recorded in 2018, and according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, calving has been down 40% since 2010., “People always focus on the calves,” George says. “But what really matters is protecting the females of reproductive age. There are only 100 left, and at their current calving rates, they aren’t replacing themselves, or the number of right whales killed each year by human activity.” The females need to have an estimated 17-20 calves total each year to sustain the population., I mention Dragon, a 19-year-old female right whale spotted this year off the coast of Nantucket with a fishing buoy entangled in her mouth, dying. George pauses. “I remember when she had her first calf,” he says., “You know, it’s not a quick death,” George adds. “They suffer out there, entangled and not able to feed. It’s long and painful.”, George has watched whales struggle to survive horrendous ship strike injuries. He’s seen fishing rope embedded in the whales’ faces, cutting through bones, entire lips pulled off., One of his favorite whales is Ruffian, whom he first spotted with chunks of blubber missing after an entanglement. “We assumed he was a goner,” George says. “But he came back the next season, scarred.” Ruffian returned to Georgia waters another time, snow crab rope trailing behind him., “Eighty per cent of right whales have scars,” George tells me. “And 60% have been entangled twice. People would be shocked.”, Right whales were once hunted to near-extinction by whalers. They were known as the “right” and easy whale to hunt – docile, slow-swimming and huge – 52 feet long and sometimes weighing in just under 70 tons., Often referred to as the “urban whale”, North Atlantic right whales spend most of their year feeding close to the shorelines of New England and Atlantic Canada. Each winter pregnant females and other members of the species migrate 1,000 miles south to Georgia and Florida, the species’ only known calving grounds. Their coastal distribution places them in close proximity to large population centers, and all the human activities that go with that, from commercial fishing and shipping, to pollution and military training. , No one really knows how long North Atlantic right whales can live, because human activity has affected their life spans so drastically. Experts presume they can live until 65 or 70, though some species of whale, like the bowhead, can live to 200. What we do know is that human activity has endangered this species and drastically shortened their lifespan to 35-40., This year’s calving season of 10, while better than zero, is still not enough to sustain the species. Plus, one of the 10 calves was probably mortally injured in a boat strike in the first days of its life. Make that a calving season of nine – less than half of what the right whales need to replenish themselves., Why is it so hard to save this intelligent, gentle giant – one so critical to the health of our planet? (Whale excrement fertilizes phytoplankton that produce a significant amount of oxygen on Earth.), “A species that most people have never seen is harder to convince others to save,” says Dr Erica Fuller, a veterinarian and a lawyer with Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, Massachusetts. “If you saw one, you’d be struck by how majestic they are.”, The whales are at risk any time fishing rope is left unattended in their habitat. But ropes used on offshore gillnets, lobster pots, snow crab pots and other so-called “fixed gear” fisheries are particularly problematic. These synthetic ropes can be set for weeks or months at a time, and require thousands of pounds of force to break loose from., “Much of the frustration of the right whale work is the slowness at which agencies are taking action,” Fuller says. “Plus, the same federal agency charged with authorizing the commercial fisheries that entangle them is also in charge of protecting this critically endangered species. It’s a terrible conflict of interest.”, The real tragedy, according to Fuller, happened when the whales traveled into the Gulf of St Lawrence looking for food and, simultaneously, the snow crab fishery exploded. This shift was the perfect storm for entanglement, responsible for several deaths in 2017., When I speak with Regina Asmutis-Silvia, executive director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, she is quick to point out that no fishermen intend to catch whales. “They aren’t doing it on purpose,” she says. “We know they face hardships, too.”, Asmutis-Silvia, who has been working on these issues for 30 years, remembers seeing her first entangled whale: “You could see visible infections, and the whale was in a great deal of pain. The skin had grown over the line. For me, that’s when entanglement moved from a conceptual problem to a real one.”, There hasn’t yet been a broad fix to entanglement. “I think we’re closer with so-called ropeless fishing gear,” Asmutis-Silvia says. “It’s a costly transition, but it has tremendous potential. It’s the most promising solution I’ve seen.”, And then there’s the boat collisions. More than half of the known right whale population migrated into Cape Cod Bay in the summer of 2019, following their food source of phytoplankton. As they journey there and further northward toward Canada, they cross shipping lanes, putting them at risk of death by blunt force trauma and propeller cuts., Research shows that slowing shipping speeds down from an average of 24 knots to 10 can help improve the odds for right whales, but several ships were fined by Transportation Canada for ignoring the warnings. The reduction in speed orders are lifted when no right whales are spotted, but detection mechanisms are faulty, and ship strikes have contributed to 30 deaths of right whales in the last three years., The right whale calf born to Derecha that was struck this calving season – its head sliced by the propeller of a vessel – is presumed dead., “Trying to understand where the right whales are, and what their lives are like underwater, is difficult for humans,” Dr Genevieve Davis says. She’s an expert in passive acoustic monitoring, listening for whales as they pass through specific zones. Right whales are vocal – when socializing in “surface active groups” they scream, blow, gunshot, upcall, warble and downcall., “People don’t think about noise pollution as a common threat, but it masks important communication cues,” Davis says. “A calf might not be able to find her mother. These whales need to navigate, find mates and locate food. There’s a masking effect that changes communication abilities., “If you think about Massachusetts bays and New York harbors,” she says, “it’s like trying to talk on a phone in the city with sirens and traffic, versus talking on a phone in an empty field. That’s what their world is like now.”, This human-caused “acoustic smog” travels far, and is now constant in our ocean. It includes vessels, alternative energy sources and seismic surveys, which Davis says are so loud they can cause chronic stress and physical pain, like being next to the speakers at a loud concert., Passive acoustic tracking is an important component of a suite of whale-tracking measures, including aerial surveys and reports from fishermen. Currently there is no reliable, compassionate way to track the right whales with GPS, which would theoretically help boat captains avoid ship strikes. Blubber and water make tagging difficult., “No tagging method is really long-term,” Dr Davis says. “These whales are already endangered and many are in poor health – we don’t want to cause more suffering.”, “I look forward to the day when there aren’t more people working to save right whales than the actual number of whales themselves,” Asmutis-Silvia tells me. She recounts the time she spotted a right whale named Wart off the coast of Cape Cod, with a calf., “There she was,” Asmutis-Silver says. “A tiny little shoehorn face with no callosity.

It was incredible.”, “They’re so amazing – so resilient,” she adds. “These whales have such an ability to recover if we would only give them the chance.”, Climate change is already acting as a cruel catalyst, warming the whales’ habitat, causing currents to shift and altering the distribution of plankton the whales depend on. If these changes force the whales into new habitats with greater human activities but fewer protections, the results could be disastrous. This is exactly what appears to be happening in the Gulf of St Lawrence in Canada, where more than 20 right whales (5% of the existing population) have been found dead since 2017., “Everything we think we know this summer could be different two summers from now,” Dr Fuller says., “Watching right whales has been compared to watching the decline of vaquitas,” Dr Fuller tells me. “We’re watching the last ones die.”, “We’re responsible for the right whales’ demise,” she says, “and we are responsible for saving them from extinction.”, If you see a violation or injured animal, call the Northeast Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Stranding and Entanglement Hotline: (866) 755-6622.

They say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis, but such action has not been taken to date., The fossil fuel industry, which already benefits from a $5tn-a-year subsidy, according to the IMF, has had the biggest wins during the coronavirus pandemic in the US and Canada., The controversial Keystone XL pipeline to transport tar sands oil from Canada to the US got the go-ahead, with $5bn in financial support from the Alberta government. US president Donald Trump called the move “GREAT news”. Other pipelines continued construction despite the lockdown., To “alleviate financial hardship” to the US fossil fuel industry, Trump directed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be filled to its maximum capacity., The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a sweeping suspension of its enforcement of environmental laws, three days after a request from the American Petroleum Institute, and extended the period that the more polluting winter gasoline can be sold., Three US states passed laws criminalising fossil fuel protests – South Dakota, Kentucky and West Virginia., Republican senators asked the US federal government to “reduce, delay or suspend” taxes due on oil, gas and coal, while the National Mining Association lobbied to cut $220m in taxes intended to support coal miners affected by black lung disease., In China, as the worst impacts of the virus outbreak passed, there was a surge in permits for new coal-fired power plants. From 1 to 18 March, more coal-fired capacity was approved than in the whole of 2019. In South Korea, the major coal plant builder Doosan Heavy Industries got a $825m government bailout; green groups say the company was in deep financial trouble before the pandemic. In Australia, lobbyists welcomed the South Australia government’s move to defer taxes and other commitments to oil and gas explorers., In the US, assistance for the green energy sector was not included in the $2tn support package on 26 March, three days after 24 rightwing thinktanks, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said they were “deeply disturbed” by possibility of funding for “unreliable ‘green’ energy programs”. However, New York state did pass new laws to speed up clean energy projects., In Brazil, the energy regulator has indefinitely postponed green power auctions scheduled for 2020 and in South Africa, the state-owned power giant Eskom, which relies heavily on coal, said it will cut the wind power it had committed to buy., In the US, the EPA finalised its rollback of Obama-era rules that made cars less polluting. In the EU, lobby groups argued for a delay in emissions reduction laws, although VW, BMW and Daimler say they are aiming to comply regardless of the virus crisis., A leaked letter from the International Air Transport Association describes its “aggressive” lobbying approach and includes a call for relief from corporate taxes, sales taxes, employer-paid payroll taxes and passenger ticket taxes., In the US, aviation got a $60bn bailout package and the suspension of many taxes. In the UK, major carrier easyJet got a £600m soft loan, weeks after its biggest shareholder received almost £60m in dividends., In the EU, the farmers’ association Copa-Cogeca called for a further postponement of the “farm to fork” strategy, which is aimed at making agriculture less polluting. The call is backed by the rightwing EPP bloc, the largest group in the European parliament., In Germany, its farming lobby pushed for an easing of environmental standards, particularly those restricting fertiliser use, which are intended to reduce pollution. In the US, the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association lobbied heavily and won a $23.5bn bailout package. Agricultural pollution is the cause of a huge “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico., In the US, the plastic industry lobbied to remove bans on single-use plastic bags, citing hygiene concerns, and saw bans lifted in Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon and Massachusetts. The EPA also weakened the Toxic Substances Control Act for many chemical and petrochemical manufacturers., In the EU, plastic industry lobbyists asked the European commission to postpone implementation of the single-use plastic directive, intended to cut plastic pollution. However, the commission rejected this call. In England, a ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds that was due in April has been postponed., In Indonesia, the trade ministry revoked rules requiring basic certification that wood exports were legally produced in response to lobbying from the furniture and logging industries, according to campaign group Mighty Earth., The Covid-19 crisis has seen some backing for a sustainable recovery and rejections of polluter lobbying. G20 finance ministers committed to an “environmentally sustainable and inclusive recovery” and EU leaders backed “measures necessary to get back to a normal functioning of our societies and economies and to sustainable growth”., The European commission has not delayed its consultation on a new green finance strategy and is now considering imposing new requirements on firms to reduce the risk of biodiversity loss and pandemics. This is despite coal-heavy states including Poland and the Czech Republic urging the bloc to abandon its Green Deal plan and emissions trading scheme., In France, the government has approved 288 wind and solar energy projects and has relaxed deadlines and cancelled a planned withdrawal of rooftop solar subsidies. Germany rejected calls to ease the planned shutdown of its coal industry, while in Canada prime minister Justin Trudeau rejected the call from Albertan companies to postpone an increase in the federal carbon tax., The fallout from the pandemic is also delaying a number of big fossil fuel projects, from LNG terminals in Australia to coal plants in Indonesia.polluter bailouts and lobbying during covid 19 pandemic", "label": 0}, "train-684": {"text": "\n'Coronavirus profiteers' condemned as polluters gain bailout billions\n, Leaders condemn backing of global sectors that disregard green economy goals, \nDamian Carrington Environment editor, \n\nFri 17 Apr 2020 05.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 17 Apr 2020 05.21 EDT\n\n, Polluting industries around the world are using the coronavirus pandemic to gain billions of dollars in bailouts and to weaken and delay environmental protections., The moves by the fossil fuel, motor, aviation, farming, plastic and timber sectors are described as dangerous and irresponsible by senior figures. Environmental campaigners describe some participants in these industries as “coronavirus profiteers”., Economic and energy leaders say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis and create a safer, more resilient, world. However, such action has been lacking to date, they warn., Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “When I look at different parts of the world I have not seen yet a major emphasis on clean-energy technologies.” He warned of mistakes similar to those made after the 2008 financial crisis when stimulus packages led to the biggest leap in carbon emissions in 50 years, four times greater than the reduction initially seen., “If we put the money in the right place, we can manage the climate risk, and have a much more modern, cleaner and safer energy system,” Birol told the Guardian. “But if you put the money in the wrong place we will lock ourselves in a dirtier energy system, making it much more difficult to reach our climate targets.”, Rachel Kyte, at Tufts University, US, a former UN special representative for energy and former World Bank Group vice president, said: “Covid-19 puts our economies at a fork in the road. Using public money to bail out firms that will take us on the road which doesn’t accelerate decarbonisation and doesn’t address inequality is not just unaffordable, it’s dangerous.”, Unlike in the US, where the Trump administration has rolled back environmental protections, the EU has backed a green recovery., Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president for the Green Deal at the European commission, said: “Tackling the Covid-19 emergency cannot and will not throw us off course in our efforts to tackle the climate crisis that still looms large as one of humanity’s most daunting challenges.”, “Bailouts should all be linked with clear conditions that the money will be used for a green economy and a green society. The very least that should be done is to ascertain that none of our commitments are used to harm our climate goals.”, The nature of the global economic recovery is being shaped with meetings this week of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, and by the World Bank and IMF. Much of the initial financial aid from governments was rescue packages to prevent immediate economic collapse, but further huge sums are expected to build recovery., Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, who was France’s climate change ambassador when the global Paris climate deal was sealed in 2015, said: “We know speed is essential with so many lives and livelihoods at stake, but it would be irresponsible to knowingly lock in more human suffering by enabling more pollution.”, Lord Stern, a climate economist at the London School of Economics, UK, said: “The nature and shape of this recovery will determine our future. It is crucial it does not lock in our exposure to the great risks of climate change.” But he said it was important to distinguish between rescue packages and recovery packages and not, for example, to withhold support for the workers in high-carbon sectors., Michael Liebrich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the systems of the past were already failing the world before Covid-19. “As governments again load the helicopters with money to dump on the global economy … no fossil fuel-based businesses should be bailed out without committing to science-based, net-zero targets. No money should go to industries that have been living high on the hog on fossil fuel subsidies and tax loopholes, like the airline industry, unless they accept structural reform.”, Ben Backwell, CEO at the Global Wind Energy Council, said some governments had extended commissioning deadlines for new wind farms, including those of India, Germany and Greece. “But so far no government has explicitly included stimulus packages specific to the wind and other renewable sectors. Much diplomatic effort went into brokering the OPEC+ deal to stabilise oil prices but the discussion needs to move on now to ensuring that renewable energy is at the centre of economic recovery plans.”, The course of the recovery has yet to be decided, according to Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank. “I think it is too soon to say that the battle for funds to rebuild our economy is being won by the polluting sectors of business, especially on climate change. There are some strong political forces already pushing hard to make it a recovery that is green.”, Timmermans said a sustainable society was the only way to create lasting growth and jobs. Birol, who highlighted energy efficiency for buildings and battery and hydrogen technologies as important goals, also said that the current low oil prices were an opportunity to abolish $400bn a year of consumer fossil fuel subsidies, boosting government budgets., The UN secretary general, António Guterres, was clear about the need to rebuild a different global economy. “Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies, and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change, and the many other global challenges we face.”coronavirus profiteers condemned as polluters gain bailout billions", "label": 0}, "train-685": {"text": "'If one of us gets sick, we all get sick': the food workers on the coronavirus front line, \n'If one of us gets sick, we all get sick': the food workers on the coronavirus front line\n, Low-paid women in US poultry factories are leading the struggle for fair conditions and basic safety. As Covid-19 rips through plants across the country, they have a fight on their hands. By  Mya Frazier, \n\nFri 17 Apr 2020 01.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 05.14 EDT\n\n, It was only about an hour into Sophia’s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia’s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight., On this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death., As greenish-yellow fumes began to spread inside the plant, Sophia heard a man yelling, “Vamonos, vamonos!” Panic set in among the workers, many of whom were struggling to breathe. The exit closest to Sophia’s workstation was the same door through which the gas was entering. She pulled the top of her sweater up from under her rubber apron, stretching it over her nose. It was a futile gesture. As she waited for her frantic colleagues to get out of the door, all she could do was pray: “God save me, God save me.” When, at last, she made it outside, she saw dozens of workers sprawled on the pavement., Springdale was ill-prepared for the scale of the disaster. The city had only four ambulances, so the fire department was scrambled to take injured workers to hospital. Sophia and others needing medical attention were eventually put on a city bus. Sophia was still struggling to breathe. She began vomiting and coughing up blood. Many of the 173 workers who were taken to hospital recovered quickly, but others had symptoms that became more serious. Three workers developed chronic asthma; Sophia (she did not want to use her real name out of fear of retaliation from Tyson, where she still works) was among them., It was one of the worst industrial accidents ever seen in Springdale, and the biggest to hit Tyson’s Berry Street plant, where 600 workers attend production lines, in shifts, 18 hours a day, processing 140 chickens per minute. On most days, the stench of chicken manure hangs about the downtown complex, and a steady stream of trucks unloads crates of squawking chickens for slaughter, before their carcasses are stripped and washed with chemicals., The Berry Street plant is one of 123 operated across the US by Tyson Foods Inc. With sales of $42bn last year, Tyson is the largest processor of chicken in the world. Founded in Springdale in the 1930s, the business transformed a once quiet agricultural town of fewer than 3,000 people into a sprawling city of 81,000. As the largest private employer, Tyson dominates the local economy and has built a reputation as a beneficent corporate presence. It makes large donations to local nonprofits, including food banks and, through its chaplaincy programme – one is assigned to every Tyson processing plant – has many local priests and preachers on its payroll., However, allegations of a widespread effort to suppress wages has tarnished this charitable image. According to a lawsuit filed in late 2019 against Tyson and 17 other poultry processors in the US, the wages paid to the hundreds of thousands of mostly immigrant workers were kept low through illegal means. Since 2009, the suit contends, executives from the 18 poultry companies held secret meetings in Florida, where they conspired to fix lower wages by sharing detailed information about hourly pay and benefits. Tyson declined to comment on the suit., Chicken processing is one of the lowest-paid and most hazardous industries in the US, according to a 2017 report by the US Government Accountability Office, which revealed that workers suffer carpal tunnel syndrome at a rate seven times the national average. In 2013, the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) placed Tyson in the agency’s severe violator enforcement program, which targets “recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat, or failure-to-abate violation” after a worker’s hand was severed by a conveyer belt. (Tyson said the proposed penalty was later withdrawn, when the OSHA was satisfied remedial action had been taken.) In 2016, after a worker’s finger was severed at a Tyson processing plant in Center, Texas, OSHA inspectors found more than a dozen violations, including inadequate safety guards on machines, carbon dioxide levels above exposure limits, and no protective equipment for workers handling chemicals. In March, a contractor cleaning machinery in a Tyson chicken plant in Alabama was decapitated in an accident., After the 2011 accident, Tyson says it increased training for workers handling chemicals, and now stores chlorine and acid-based chemicals separately. However, in June 2019, five workers were hospitalised after being sprayed with chemicals from a hose at the Springdale plant. In a written statement, Tyson blamed a contractor for the accident. “A contractor left a hose without following proper rinsing or storage procedure and asked our team members to gather the hose for the contractor’s use,” the company said. One of the workers was reported to be in a critical condition for two days., Sophia was back at work soon after the chemical leak at the plant. She had no choice. She still felt weak and faint, but she received no sick pay during this time. In the days after the accident, she had a recurring nightmare in which she relived the terror of seeing a female worker falling to the floor during the rush to escape., While Sophia was recovering in hospital, she later told me, something changed in her. She had survived, and she wasn’t going to leave another woman behind again. She would find a way to speak out about the low wages that left her and other families barely able to make ends meet. They feared seeking work elsewhere, in case their injuries would cost them their health insurance. “I’m stuck and I had no choice but to fight,” she told me., Sophia was not alone. Alarmed that their employer was not taking their concerns seriously, a number of workers, led by a group of Latina women, began taking on Tyson foods directly in a bid to negotiate better working conditions, living wages and sick pay. Many of them work at the Berry Street plant. They were still negotiating when coronavirus reached the US, and food factory workers were suddenly trapped on the front line, helping to keep Americans fed., On 13 March, the first community-spread case of Covid-19 was reported in Arkansas. Not long after, Tyson told its salaried employees at corporate headquarters to work from home. Schools were soon closed in Springdale, but its processing plants kept operating, including Berry Street. Americans were stocking up with food, preparing for weeks of isolation, and demand was high. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, told food workers they were part of the “critical infrastructure” and must “show up and do their job”. As fear grew among meat processing workers that the plants may be unsafe, Tyson offered a bonus of $500 if people turn up for three months without missing a shift., Sophia kept going to work every day, even though she was vulnerable to infection: her asthma, caused by the chlorine gas accident, increases the risk to her health if exposed to Covid-19. “I am afraid. My lungs are not healthy,” she told me last month. She had moved to the evisceration lines, cutting the tails off chicken carcasses, then removing any guts or feathers left, because the cold air in the packing room made her cough. “I don’t know where to be, where I can feel safe,” she said., Sophia said she was afraid the virus would spread quickly through the crowded plant. But like other workers on the chicken processing lines, she had to keep working. If she didn’t show up at the Berry Street plant, she wouldn’t get paid. She also knew the cost of taking on the most powerful company in town: she had spent much of the last decade battling Tyson over workers’ rights, and she had learned that even the smallest concession involved a mighty struggle., After the 2011 chlorine gas disaster, Tyson faced few financial consequences. Investigators with OSHA arrived on the scene just over 24 hours after the accident, and following a five-month investigation, judged that the company had been negligent. Tyson had failed to “ensure that the employees had effective hazard communications training”, and “not all employees understood the labelling system in the facility”, according to the inspection report (which I obtained through a freedom of information request). Although the failure was categorised as “serious”, the fine came to only $7,000. Yet during a year in which Tyson posted profits of $733m, the company contested that minimal fine, and through an informal settlement with the federal agency in 2012, paid only $2,500 – or $14 for each of the 173 workers whose injuries were serious enough for them to be hospitalised., The workers at the Berry Street plant, some of whom were still dealing with the effects of the chemical gas leak, were unimpressed. Many of them attended a community health clinic a few blocks from the plant, where a member of staff, Magaly Licolli, a young Mexican immigrant, heard their stories. “These stories changed me for life,” Licolli said. She spent the next five years working with the poultry workers in town to try to improve their conditions., In February 2016, Licolli stood outside Tyson’s headquarters alongside dozens of workers, many of whom had been injured in the 2011 chlorine gas incident. Licolli, by then director at NW Arkansas Workers Justice Center, was announcing the release of a damning report based on interviews with 500 poultry workers throughout the state – a third of whom worked for Tyson – who described poorly paid, physically gruelling work. Nine out of 10 of them said they received no sick pay, and nearly two-thirds said they had no option but to work while sick. Female workers said male supervisors put restrictions on their bathroom breaks, which meant they sometimes wet themselves on the production line., The report offered a rare window into workers’ experiences in one of the state’s largest industries, and a chance for a largely immigrant workforce in Springdale to speak out against an unequal system that netted billions for Tyson, while many workers lived below the poverty line. “We were working within a very hostile culture in Arkansas,” Licolli recalled. “Talking about labour in the south was already a challenge because of its history of slavery, and the labour laws still, in many ways, reflect that kind of thinking.”, That hostile culture became even harsher after Trump’s landslide victory in Arkansas in the 2016 election. The state’s two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman, frequently echoed the president’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Cotton sponsored a bill to cut legal immigration by half in a decade, while Boozman pushed for legislation to give Trump billions for his border wall. Both had received significant campaign contributions from Tyson, although the company had played an important part in boosting immigration, having sent buses to bring temporary workers from Mexico and put them to work in its processing plants and hatcheries., The day after the report came out, the workers’ campaign group pressed Tyson for a response. Licolli and workers from Berry Street gathered to continue their protest outside a Holiday Inn in Springdale, where Tyson’s annual shareholder meeting was underway. Later that day, Licolli went to Tyson’s corporate headquarters, accompanied by a local minister and Minor Sinclair, a director of US domestic programmes for Oxfam. Licolli was the only Latina at the table before a dozen or so executives, all but one of whom were men. She recalled the tension around the table. “They were really mad that we were taking these actions,” she said. “I felt like they were lecturing us.”, Executives pointed out the various measures and processes in place for health and safety, and rejected the findings of the report, which they felt did not reflect conditions at Tyson. All the same, as Licolli left Tyson’s HQ, she felt proud that, for the first time, plant workers had taken Tyson to task in its hometown. “I felt like it was the beginning of something different,” she said, A few months later, on 11 May 2016, Oxfam released its own report, which claimed that Tyson chicken processors were so afraid of being fired if they failed to hit their quota on the production line that they dared not take bathroom breaks. Workers had come up with a job-saving innovation – wearing adult diapers, urinating and even defecating as they worked the line, rather than fall behind., The bathroom-breaks scandal made the news across the US, and internationally. A response on Tyson’s website expressed concern about “these anonymous claims” in the Oxfam report, saying that “while we currently have no evidence they’re true”, they would check that company policy on breaks was being followed., For Licolli, the Oxfam report was a great leap forward. “It felt like a relief for them to have our back,” she recalls. “We were stronger in that moment than ever before.” The same day, in coordination with Oxfam, Licolli delivered 150,000 signatures wrapped in plastic on Styrofoam trays, like chicken breasts, to Tyson’s headquarters. In response, Tyson issued a press release that struck an accommodating tone: “We’ve told them that while we believe we’re a caring, responsible company, we’re always willing to consider ways we can do better.”, Over the following months, falling food prices brought a slump in profits. Tyson replaced its CEO, and in April 2017, under new leadership, made some changes to working conditions, in consultation with Oxfam. But when Licolli read Tyson’s statement on the new commitments, her heart sank. There were pledges to improve safety and rates of pay, but to Licolli, it was all very vague. “There was nothing explicit,” she told me. “No ‘we are going to do this by this time’ … it was just empty. Workers would have no oversight or say in anything.” Moreover, there was no mention of bathroom breaks., While Oxfam hailed the agreement as a “big win” on worker rights, Licolli felt betrayed. The charity had relied heavily for its research on her connections with poultry workers in town, but Licolli felt that at a certain point, she and the workers’ delegates had been left out of the discussion. “It was just like Tyson and Oxfam getting together and shaking hands and saying: ‘Good for you, good for me, let’s say you are a good company,’” Licolli told me. She reluctantly agreed to Oxfam’s request to issue a statement. “I do think the company wants to change, but we’re also very cautious,” she wrote., When we approached Oxfam for comment, the charity said in a statement: “Since the beginning of Oxfam’s poultry campaign in 2015, we have focused on elevating the voices of poultry workers and advocating for worker rights and safe working conditions for front-line processing workers … In non-union plants including Berry Street, Oxfam has urged, and continues to do so, that Tyson includes workers in review and monitoring of its commitments to a better workplace.”, But Licolli’s caution turned out to be prescient. The workers were soon fighting a dangerous new threat to their health., After the slowdown of 2017, Tyson and the rest of the poultry industry wasted no time trying to turbo-charge chicken production. That meant resuming an old battle over production line speeds. In the last half century, poultry processors have increased line speeds from less than 100 birds per minute to 140 – the legal maximum established by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Even at that rate, according to the US Government Accountability Office, workers risked injury and pain, but chicken factories were lobbying aggressively to get slaughter and evisceration lines moving faster., In late December 2017, Licolli travelled to Washington DC with injured workers, including Sophia, to challenge the line-speed proposals, and met with officials at the USDA. For Sophia, it was a revelation. “I had a voice for the first time,” she recalls. Working with Licolli she had found friendship and the courage to tell her story. The following month, in a surprise move, the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the USDA accepted their arguments and those of other workers’ right groups, and turned down the request to speed up chicken processing lines., But the next battle followed quickly. The meat and poultry industry had begun using a new weapon against bacteria in greater volumes. Peracetic acid – an antimicrobial developed for sterilising medical equipment – was found, if sprayed on carcasses, to reliably kill bacteria without leaving residue, which meant the whole process could be sped up. But, while safe for consumers, research has shown that it may carry health risks for workers. Long exposure has been shown to cause eye, skin and nose irritations to medical workers, as well as asthma., In 2017, Tyson announced plans to stop feeding human antibiotics to chickens, and began relying more heavily on antimicrobials. Jenny Leigh Houlroyd, a certified industrial hygienist and a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech, has been studying the use of peracetic acid in the poultry industry for years, and worries that a disaster may be slowly unfolding inside the lungs of workers. In 2018 she led a team of researchers in a pilot study of peracetic acid at four chicken plants in Georgia. During her time in the plants, workers told her about eye irritation, sore throats, headaches and sinus infections. The use of peracetic acid has been approved by the USDA and there is still no legal limit on exposure levels. With 250,000 poultry workers in the US exposed to peracetic acid, Houlroyd adds: “The industry needs to be listening to their workers. In the absence of definitive data, that is where you have to go. You have to listen to workers.”, On a warm Tuesday evening in October 2019, not far from the Berry Street plant, Sophia was among two dozen or so women rearranging folding chairs into a semi-circle inside a one-room church on a Springfield strip mall. Like Sophia, the women were Latina immigrants, all of whom have worked low-wage jobs in the city’s chicken plants., “Nothing has changed,” Sophia said. “Oxfam sold us out.” Her voice, once strong and clear, was thin and soft, barely above a whisper, and punctuated by fits of coughing., The women had begun meeting quietly together for some time. The Oxfam agreement had created a major rift within what, at the time, was a growing movement among poultry workers. With little change in their daily working conditions, these women felt betrayed. They decided they wouldn’t rely on outsiders to negotiate for them any more., The previous year, Licolli, along with Sophia and other workers, had made two visits down to Immokalee, Florida, known as the nation’s tomato capital, where a worker-led movement had transformed the conditions and wages for field workers, mostly poor immigrants from Latin America. The trip had been transformative for Sophia, who told me it gave her hope, for the first time, that they could bring about change within a company as powerful as Tyson., The Florida campaign had put workers’ voices at the centre of the conversation with the brands who sourced their tomatoes in Immokalee. Licolli wondered if she could bring that model to the poultry industry. Instead of protesting, they would bring their fight to the household brands that buy Tyson chicken, such as McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Kroger and Chick-fil-A, Licolli said, “by alerting consumers to the injustice behind their favourite foods”. But in January 2019, when Licolli brought those ideas to the board of the Northwest Arkansas Workers’ Justice Center, they were rejected. “I was called a radical. And it’s not that I am an extremist,” she recalled. “But even the minimum effort of organising, it has to be radical. There is no sugar-coating our message for people to feel comfortable working with us.”, The clash over appropriate action proved irreparable, and in March, Licolli was dismissed as director of the centre. Subsequently, dozens of women, including Sophia, left. A few months later, the centre shut down. It had taken months for the women’s campaign to get going again, but here they were, with their folding chairs and a new banner with a crowing rooster on it. “Because we are fighters,” Licolli explained, as she went to work hanging it on the wall. On the banner was the name of their new labour organisation, Venceremos – meaning “we will win”. The women spent the evening planning the public launch of the new organisation, and shared their concerns about how they would overcome the fear other workers had about organising., A few days later, Licolli drove up to a Springdale shopping centre for the official launch of Venceremos, where poultry workers were already waiting, having finished their day shifts at the nearby plants. She pinned up her rooster banner. The showing was better than she had hoped. Before she started, she asked all plant workers to raise their hands, and asked no one to post photos on social media from the event, fearing that Tyson might target them for retaliation. A reporter from Univision Arkansas came by, and a three-worker delegation arrived from Immokalee, including Gerardo Reyes Chavez. He believes the new workers’ movement has potential. “Despite all the circumstances they’ve had to confront,” he said, “they are really strong people, and they are trying to leave the world a better place than how the world has treated them.”, In January, workers noted increased shipments of peracetic acid to the Berry Street plant. Many workers were experiencing coughing, nose irritation and breathing problems. In mid-February, a group of 16 Venceremos workers walked into the office of a supervisor to tell them about the symptoms they were experiencing. The supervisor dismissed the idea that the chemicals were causing the symptoms, saying they sounded like the flu. However, he agreed to improve ventilation in the plant. Tyson said all employees working with chemicals were required to have training, maintain personal protective equipment, and were “instructed to report any irritations immediately to their manager”., In mid-March, with the number of Covid-19 cases rising across Arkansas, Sophia, like hundreds of other workers at the Berry Street plant, was given “essential employee verification” papers and told to keep them with her at all times. Sophia was deemed one of the nation’s “essential critical infrastructure” workers. She would be exempt from curfews, shelter-in-place orders and other mobility restrictions, so she might “provide services essential to the production of food”., Five days a week, Sophia kept going to work on the evisceration line. Some days she woke up and felt the phantom balloon in her chest. She went to work anyway, fearful of losing a day’s pay. When we spoke in March, she said there was no way to practise social distancing at the plant., “We are all standing close together all the time. I’m afraid. It’s not only about the line. When we finish our shift, or we come in to start, we all come in together through the same doors. If one of us gets sick, all of us get sick.”, Sophia read news reports of the virus with growing alarm. Then, after hearing rumours flying around Springdale about coronavirus spreading on processing lines, Sophia decided that, with her lungs already weakened from the chemical accident, she could not risk going to work. She stayed at home., Workers were calling Licolli for help and advice, many of them anxious about conditions in the plants. Licolli sent out a flurry of texts and began setting up conference and video calls with other poultry workers. They put together a list of demands. Venceremos members launched an online petition demanding that Tyson, and other poultry processors in Arkansas, provide paid sick leave to workers if they were forced to self-isolate at home, for all the days they must miss. Within days, the petition had nearly 8,000 signatures., On 13 March, Tyson had relaxed attendance policies for hourly workers: anyone who missed work due to illness from Covid-19 would not be fired or fined. On 31 March, it announced that workers would be eligible for short-term disability benefits should they fall ill. But it wouldn’t cover their full pay, only 60%. And not all plant workers qualified. Pressed on the gaps in the policy’s coverage for low-wage line workers, Tyson said in a statement: “We’ll work with them to explore ways we can help. We want to help everyone, even if they don’t have health insurance coverage.” The company also said: “If a team member is quarantined because they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, they receive full pay while they’re out.”, On Monday, Tyson released a short video showing the measures it had put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Berry Street plant, including allowing for social distancing. The company said that in March, it had begun testing workers’ temperatures as they arrived for their shifts. In early April, it started distributing masks and putting up barriers between workers on the production lines., Workers did not seem to be reassured. The offer of $500 bonuses Tyson made to workers if they turned up for every shift for three months has backfired, Licolli told me. “It only made them more angry. They are risking their lives and this was nothing compared to the risks they are taking. They are afraid they might not even get the bonuses if they end up getting sick.”, In early April, two workers at a Tyson plant in Georgia died from the virus. Tyson closed a pork plant in Iowa at the start of April after around two dozen workers tested positive for Covid-19; 186 people have now tested positive, and two people have died, presumed to be from Covid-19. Meat processing workers across the US and Canada are staging walkouts., Licolli said the crisis was spurring what could soon become an unstoppable movement among workers. “We’re in such a crucial moment right now,” she told me this week. “There’s an urgency among poultry workers to organise and to mobilise. We’re building a stronger movement that has the potential to bring about change. For the future of the country, we must think deeply about the meaning of these workers in our daily lives and stand up for their human rights and dignity – because they’ve always been essential, and if they don’t survive, we won’t survive.”, • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.chicken factory tyson arkansas food workers coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-686": {"text": "\nCountry diary: life is at a standstill but the bees are still buzzing\n, Stamford, Lincolnshire: Audible from 20 metres away, the bees are intensely interested in the saturated cherry blossom, \nSimon Ingram, \n\nFri 17 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, Life is at a standstill. Homebound stasis forces me to look at the patch of the countryside I should know the best, but never looked at hard enough. Which, now, is a lifeboat of certainty on strange seas: the world beyond the walls., I find a small spot in my garden, and for half an hour, on three days, stand still. Nature ceases to be expansive, but immersive: a column, a few feet all around me, from the ground to the sky, in which to look, and listen., This new ritual falls fortuitously on days of change. Days that are breathlessly still, with that sunshine that gilds the edges of everything, the year’s first real warmth. Of sweet smells, sudden unexpected lines of light, and shadows of rich black., The spot is next to a small cherry blossom. I look up past its branches and there’s an azure aperture of sky. Across one side reach the arms of a silver birch, fibrous catkins hung like rotted robes. Across another, a horse chestnut tree, its silhouette just beginning to thicken with leaf., It’s the bees that draw me at first. I can hear them from 20 metres away, and up close it’s a frenzy. The cherry is in saturated bloom, and the bees are intensely interested. So nervy, non-committal, but dutiful. Into the blossom just long enough, then on to the next hesitantly selected recipient. Like the lobby of a busy building: purposefully in, an indecisive linger, purposefully on., By the third day the cherry blossom is beginning to desaturate, to turn russet. The bee symphony is quieting, the job done. But the horse chestnut has burst to life. Brilliant emerald leaves hang like splayed hands. Suddenly, there’s new shade., Only the sky seems devoid of activity, but then a gift. I spot two red kites on the edge of this view. Meandering in flight, flirting with each other’s wing tips. I only ever see the odd one over the garden; never two. And here they come.

Fresh water flows from our snow and glacier-clad mountains, through our farms and cities, to the sea. Rivers have deep cultural values and one, the Whanganui, has been recognised as having the rights of a person. For Kiwis, our economy, our health, and our way of life depends on clean water., But our dependence on fresh water has not stopped decades of abuse. Now, our rivers and lakes are in serious trouble. On Thursday, a wide-ranging, data-driven report into the state of New Zealand’s rivers, lakes and freshwater ecosystems was released by two government departments, the Ministry for the Environment and Statistics NZ. Their findings, delivered during a nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, couldn’t be more alarming. Our freshwater ecosystems are at breaking point; the damage is overwhelming and in some cases irreversible., Between 95% and 99% of rivers in urban, pastoral, and non-native forest areas are heavily polluted; 90% of our precious wetlands have been drained and destroyed; 70% of our native freshwater fish are heading towards extinction., On top of these disastrous environmental outcomes, the report confirms that New Zealand’s economy, our identity, our cultural values, and our wellbeing depend on the health of the environment., In failing the environment, we are failing everything we value., Our utter failure to protect the ecosystems we depend on is a national disgrace and is now a national crisis., Irrigated land has increased by 100% in only 15 years, mainly to enable dairy farming in areas too dry to otherwise grow grass. Irrigation is now the single biggest water user in New Zealand, accounting for nearly half of all water taken out of the ecosystem. Conversely, at least 1,257 hectares of wetlands were destroyed between 2001 and 2016 to expand “productive” land into areas otherwise too wet., Climate change, the report warns us, will bring more frequent and longer droughts. Already, soils at a quarter of monitored sites are drying out. Some farming regions and our largest city are still suffering under one of the longest drought periods ever experienced in New Zealand. Yet our banks, government, and agricultural leaders still encourage water-dependent farming systems that cannot succeed, either environmentally or economically. The report warns us, under business as usual, New Zealand will experience food shortages., We need fresh water, and right now our rivers, lakes, and all the native plants and animals that depend on them urgently need us to protect and restore them. Never has the message been so clear, or so urgent., But public outrage at the mismanagement of our water has led to hope. After years of painstaking public and industry consultation, the meaningful freshwater management reforms that New Zealand needs are fully developed, and ready to go. The new rules will limit pollution, protect wetlands, and stop excessive water demands. These rules will rescue our rivers. But they haven’t been implemented., For too long, our environmental management systems and politicians have been captured by outdated ways of thinking about profit margins and costs, while forgetting the immeasurable losses we’re already facing in biodiversity, human health, and cultural wellbeing., And incredibly, some agriculture industry groups are calling for environmental rules to be delayed – if not ditched entirely. Covid-19, they say, means the environment will have to wait. It appears to be their view that industry can only succeed while harming the world their farming members depend on., In fact, the Covid-19 crisis has made it even more clear why New Zealand needs strong rules to protect environmental and public health. Diseases that jump from animals to humans, like Covid-19, are commonly spread from farm animals to humans through water – like Giardia, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, and Salmonella to name a few. Four years ago we experienced the world’s largest recorded outbreak of Campylobacter. We must act to ensure such outbreaks cannot and do not happen again because the costs, as we now know, are catastrophic., Delaying freshwater reform would be a disastrous step backwards for New Zealand and could be the final nail in the coffin for the natural ecosystems in our rivers, lakes, and wetlands which are already at breaking point., New Zealand, and the planet, needs transformative economic recovery that cares for people and the planet. We need to create a sustainable, ethical way of working and living that protects our natural systems, and in doing so protects us. It is obvious our current system is badly broken, but the solution is at hand. All we need are leaders with the courage to take it., Tom Kay is the freshwater advocate for Forest &amp; Bird, New Zealand’s largest independent conservation organisation.by failing to protect our water we have failed everything new zealanders value", "label": 0}, "train-688": {"text": "\nCovid-19 – a blessing for pangolins?\n, \nCovid-19 – a blessing for pangolins?\n, Pangolins are the world’s most trafficked mammals, but there is evidence that they were the source of the new coronavirus – which could end the trade , \nMichael Marshall, \n\nSat 18 Apr 2020 13.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 05.02 EDT\n\n, Covid-19 is a human disaster. However, for one group of animals, there may be a silver lining. Pangolins are one of the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, and as a result they are endangered. But in the past few weeks they have been linked to the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 disease in China. The evidence is inconclusive, but it has already prompted the Chinese government to take action. If more actions against the wildlife trade follow, the incident could prove to be a turning point for pangolin conservation., A key question is where Covid-19 came from. Many animals carry coronaviruses and are potential sources of infection. That is important to know, if only because it should help us prevent future outbreaks. Several ideas have been proposed, but arguably the most dramatic is that pangolins were the source., Pangolins look like scaly anteaters. Uniquely among mammals, their bodies are covered in hard protective scales made of keratin: the same material as our nails. They feed on insects such as ants and termites, and are often nocturnal and shy. While they look like anteaters, they are not closely related to them, and their closest living relatives are actually carnivorans: the group that includes wolves and cats., There are eight species of pangolin. Four live in Africa and four in Asia. All are at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Two of the African species are considered vulnerable and two are endangered. Of the Asian species, one is endangered while the other three are critically endangered., If animals are in closely packed, unsanitary conditions with many people nearby it is easier for a virus to jump species, Pangolins are illegally hunted and traded for two main reasons. First, their meat is considered a delicacy in several south-east Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam. And second, their scales are used in Chinese traditional medicine. As a result, they are the world’s most trafficked mammals., The idea that pangolins gave us Covid-19 emerged at a press conference given by the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou on 7 February. Two scientists there, Yongyi Shen and Lihua Xiao, were said to have compared coronaviruses from pangolins and from humans infected in the outbreak. The viruses’ genetic sequences were said to be 99% similar. One co-author, Wu Chen of Guangzhou Zoo, had previously helped show that Sunda pangolins carry coronaviruses., However, the results had not been published at that stage, so other scientists could not examine them in detail. Meanwhile, there were many other possibilities. The virus could have come from an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, where many species were held. Animals in such markets are often kept in closely packed, unsanitary conditions, with many people nearby: a perfect opportunity for a virus to jump species. Many pointed the finger at bats: the virus is genetically similar to those in bats, and it would not be the first time a disease passed from bats to humans. There was also a study linking the virus to one found in snakes, but this is now considered unlikely., Then there was a twist in the story. On 20 February the researchers posted a preliminary version of the study on the preprint site bioRxiv. The conclusions were radically different to what was described at the press conference. While the pangolin virus was “genetically related” to the one infecting humans, it was “unlikely to be directly linked to the outbreak because of the substantial sequence differences”. The 99% similarity was only in one region of the genome. Across the entire genome, the similarity was only 90.3%. There had been an “embarrassing miscommunication between the bioinformatics group and the lab group of the study”. When contacted by the Observer, Xiao declined to comment., However, the Chinese government was already lurching into action. On 24 February, China announced an immediate ban on trading and eating many wild animals, including pangolins. Officials began shutting down wild animal markets across the country., This was the latest in a series of steps that ought to reduce the pangolin trade. Back in 2016, the international trade in pangolins was entirely banned by the 183 nations that signed up to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). All eight pangolin species were placed in Appendix I of the Convention, giving them the strictest protection currently possible., However, so far this does not seem to have resulted in a drop in the number of pangolins traded, says Xu Ling, China director at wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic. The trade continues but the nature of the shipments has changed. “Before 2016 we could find frozen pangolin bodies, the meat smuggled in from other parts of south-east Asia to China,” says Ling. Nowadays most shipments are purely pangolin scales. Often they come from Africa, after being illicitly shipped out via Nigeria., More recently, in August 2019, China’s state insurance providers announced that they would stop covering medicines made from pangolin scales. The move took effect in January 2020., Against this background, it is unclear what impact China’s new ban on eating wild meat will have on pangolins. “Even without this ban, pangolin meat consumption was forbidden in China,” says Ling, as pangolins had protected status. This was reflected in the shift to importing scales. These are only legal if they come from certified sources but, as so often happens, the traders find ways around that. In the longer term, the loss of insurance funding may undercut the scale market., Meanwhile, the idea that pangolins played a role in the emergence of Covid-19 has not gone away., On 17 March, a team led by Kristian Andersen at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, published a detailed analysis of the virus’s possible origin in Nature Medicine. They say the ultimate source is likely to be bats, just as it was for the two other coronavirus outbreaks of recent years: Sars and Mers. Bats are a known reservoir of coronaviruses. Furthermore, intermediate horseshoe bats are known to carry a virus called RaTG13, whose genome is 96% identical to that of Sars-CoV-2., “It’s pretty clear the bat serves as the reservoir for this,” says Andersen. The question is how the virus travelled from bats to humans. “We are entertaining two different scenarios.”, The key question is how the virus acquired certain sequences of its genome, which allow it to bind strongly to human cells and thus infect them. The bat virus does not have these sequences., One possibility is that the bat virus made the jump to humans several months before the outbreak was detected. These early viruses would not have been especially infectious or dangerous, but they could have mutated and evolved to acquire the key genetic sequences that made them infectious., While the pangolin virus is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, its genome has the crucial binding sequences., The alternative possibility is that there was an intermediate host. “That’s where the pangolins come in,” says Andersen. While the pangolin virus as a whole is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, the pangolin virus genome does have the crucial binding sequences. This is what Shen, Xiao and their colleagues found – and it has now been supported by a further study from another Chinese group., Furthermore, a study published on 26 March in Nature discovered viruses closely related to Sars-CoV-2 in pangolins that had been smuggled into China. These viruses had binding sequences similar to those in the human viruses., “Where it’s really important is where they’re identical,” says Andersen. “While the bat virus overall is more similar, in the regions where it really matters it’s actually quite different.”, This suggests that the bat and pangolin viruses met, perhaps in the same host, and exchanged genes. Some of the bat viruses ended up with the key binding sequences from the pangolin viruses, enabling them to infect humans and unleash a pandemic. “Recombination is frequent in these types of viruses,” says Andersen. “It’s speculative, but it’s highly likely that that’s how we ended up with this new virus.”, A similar story played out before the Sars outbreak of 2002-2004. The original source of the virus was wild bats, and in 2017 researchers managed to identify a cave in China where the bats carry viruses that are virtually identical to Sars. However, the virus was probably passed to humans via civets, which are cat-like animals, leading to China imposing a temporary ban on selling civets. The more recent Mers outbreak probably moved from bats to humans via camels., However, says Andersen, we cannot yet be sure which scenario is correct. Even if there was an intermediate host, it may not have been pangolins., “We cannot conclude if pangolins are indeed the intermediate species,” agrees virologist Arinjay Banerjee of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada., The question of whether pangolins contributed to the Covid-19 outbreak will not be settled any time soon. “It’s probably going to be a long, drawn-out question,” says Andersen. Resolving the origin of Sars took years., But it may be crucial to ending the pangolin trade, because doing so requires two things. The first is strict enforcement of the rules, which China seems to want to do – it was stepping up enforcement even before the outbreak. The second is for people to stop buying pangolin products. If there is no demand, the illegal trade will become unprofitable, and suppliers will abandon it., “Just the fact there’s been all this publicity about the potential link to pangolins will probably lead to plummeting demand for them,” says Richard Thomas, head of communications at Traffic in Cambridge., More than 90% of Chinese say they would support a total ban on the trade in wild animals, no matter what the purpose, There is evidence that he is right. According to Yuhan Li of the University of Oxford, Chinese conservation organisations have been circulating a questionnaire on social media to see how people’s attitudes have shifted. More than 100,000 people have responded, and more than 90% say they would support a total ban on the trade in wild animals, no matter what the intended purpose. It is unclear if people will stick to this once the Covid-19 crisis has passed, but Ling is planning a campaign to strengthen opposition., The realisation that wildlife markets allow diseases to spread to people may spur action. When China announced the ban, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) called it “a timely, necessary and critical step” – not just for safeguarding the wild animals, but for human health. “This public health crisis must serve as a wake-up call to end the unsustainable use of endangered animals and their parts, whether as exotic pets, for food consumption or for their perceived medicinal value.”, In the best-case scenario, it will not just be pangolins that benefit. Reducing the demand for illegally traded wildlife will help many species – and protect us all from future pandemics into the bargain.covid 19 a blessing for pangolins", "label": 0}, "train-689": {"text": "\nRevealed: FA had geese killed at national centre 'to protect its pitches'\n, Sixty birds shot at England training facility in St George’s Park, Staffordshire, despite pledge to enrich local biodiversity, \nMattha Busby, \n\nSat 18 Apr 2020 04.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 18 Apr 2020 04.01 EDT\n\n, About 60 greylag geese were shot and killed at the national training centre for England football teams from 2018 to 2019 to “preserve safety” because they were defecating on the pitches., The Football Association said the birds – which it shot after obtaining a licence to kill – also left large amounts of excrement in public areas, and this not only heightened the risk of people slipping over but also raised the possibility of harmful parasites spreading., Records from Natural England, obtained by the animal rights group Stop the Cull, show the FA was licensed to kill up to 50 greylag geese a year at St George’s Park in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, from 2016 to “preserve health and safety of football teams due to excessive fouling of the pitches”., The group criticised the FA for killing the birds because they had “defecated on the lawn” and claimed it was hypocritical to cull the geese after pledging to enrich local biodiversity., In a development brief for St George’s Park submitted to Staffordshire county council in 2014, the FA said it would protect, maintain and enhance the biodiversity and geodiversity of the area., The management at the national football centre discouraged the feeding of the birds and installed fences around the ponds on the site – two of which existed before St George’s Park first opened in 2012 – and began egg oiling, a more humane method of managing geese populations, in 2018., Organisations like the FA should be leading the way with a far more holistic approach towards wild animals, Other methods such as scaring, trapping and bird proofing were also used to encourage them to move away., “As a last resort, after these recommended steps were taken to prevent problems, St George’s Park was granted a licence to control the geese on the property in order to preserve public health and safety on the site,” an FA spokesperson said, adding that about 60 in total were killed from 2018 to 2019., “This is not just about the birds defecating on the pitches but the public areas where they congregate around the site in sizeable numbers and leave large amounts of excrement behind., “This not only poses a risk to public health and safety via slips and trips but can also lead to harmful parasites found within geese faeces being transferred around the grounds – including inside publicly accessible indoor facilities – spreading the risk of contracting the diarrhoeal disease cryptosporidiosis.”, The spokesperson added that no greylag geese had been killed this year and there were no plans for further culls since the “preventive” measures had helped reduce the faeces problem., Cryptosporidiosis is a contagious intestinal infection which can seriously affect people with weakened immune systems but the actual risks posed by greylag geese in transmitting the disease to humans is unclear., At St George’s Park, the waterfowl may have been attracted to the area due to the creation of a manmade pond near the football pitches. On a planning statement proposing the creation of the national football centre, the architects wrote: “The new open area of water will provide suitable habitat for dragonflies and damselflies, breeding opportunities for amphibians and foraging habitat for bats., “The margins of the open water will be planted with native species such as sweet flag and common reed and other aquatic species will be included. Public access will be controlled to prevent disturbance to ground nesting birds.”, Jay Tiernan from Stop the Cull said: “There is something sinister in creating a pond which you show off as part of your green credentials, only to slaughter the birds that come to use it because you don’t like bird poo on your lawn., “Their planning permission application in part hinged on the benefits of the development to wildlife, so to then go and kill the geese is shocking. It’s a terrible act of hypocrisy.”, He added: “Let the wild be wild. Nature should be allowed to flourish, and organisations like the Football Association should be leading the way with a far more holistic approach towards wild animals.”, Thirty-two other licences to kill greylag geese to protect public health were granted in 2018, data published by Natural England shows. And more than 67,000 licences to kill individual geese or destroy their eggs or nests have been granted in the last five years. revealed fa had geese killed at national centre to protect its pitches", "label": 0}, "train-690": {"text": "\nBe a citizen scientist: track plastic waste, spot a spider monkey or beat coronavirus\n, Amid lockdown, millions of internet users are tuning in to interactive data-crunching projects, \nFiona Harvey Environment correspondent, \n\nSat 18 Apr 2020 03.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 18 Apr 2020 03.01 EDT\n\n, People feeling time hang heavy as they struggle with the restrictions of the lockdown may find an unexpected green uplift in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions placed on going outside are fuelling a new online surge in citizen science, as internet users tune into data-crunching projects led by academic researchers., Enforced inactivity for hundreds of millions of people around the world is giving scientists the opportunity to recruit a vast army of online helpers, aiming their collective firepower at some seemingly intractable problems, from the climate crisis to plastic waste, as well as some cute ones - spotting spider monkeys, interpreting baby burblings and snapping blossoms., Unlike some previous citizen science projects, such as the recently paused Search for Extra Terrrestrial Intelligence (Seti) that relied on exploiting the unused computing power of home PCs while their users were offline, this new crop requires people to be alert and often interactive. Instead of searching through outer space, the project leaders invite people to connect with nature and solve environmental problems closer to home., “Citizen science helps scientists and researchers analyse huge data sets which they simply couldn’t manage by themselves, helping to save them hours of time and contributing to scientific breakthroughs,” said Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, which is helping to coordinate some of the UK-based initiatives. “It’s a fantastic way to know you are making a positive difference without even having to leave your own home.”, Covid-19 is inevitably one of the most pressing research areas. Despite the efforts of governments and scientists around the world, data on the virus is still patchy, ranging from the very thorough in places such as Iceland, where a high proportion of people have been tested, to the alarmingly opaque, as the spread in many developing countries is likely be taking place without the tracking available in countries with better healthcare., Doctors and researchers at King’s College London and Guys and St Thomas’ hospitals are asking people to fill in data on their symptoms, or lack of them, through an app. The results around the UK are encouraging so far, as there has been a fall in the number of people aged 20-69 recording active symptoms, down to about 1.4 million people, from 1.9 million on 1 April. This is no substitute for proper testing, but will provide scientists with valuable data on the possible incidence and spread of the virus., Fifty years ago, an estimated 20 million people took to the streets in the US and around the world to protest against the rampant destruction of the natural environment, the extinction of species, toxic pollution, and the despoliation of pristine habitats. Earth Day on 22 April 1970 marked the first major demonstration of a new environmentalism that sought to recognise the harm we were doing through untrammelled industrialism., The results of that protest are still being felt, in legislation enacted to safeguard the environment, in the global climate movement and in conservation efforts. But planned demonstrations for the 50th anniversary – aimed at spurring a new generation of environmental activism – have had to be curtailed., Earth Day is now going online instead, and everyone with a smart phone or internet connection can take part. Two projects are currently active, on plastic and air quality, with more to follow, including tracking declining insect populations., Taking pictures of plastic litter and uploading them will allow for greater tracking of the plastic waste problem than has been possible up to now. Knowing what kind of litter is prevalent and where will help in formulating plastic waste reduction policies. The added bonus is that any cleaning up of plastic litter you do on your daily exercise outdoors will also be tracked., Air quality has improved under the coronavirus lockdowns, but that is likely to be short-lived as restrictions are lifted. The Earth Day air quality app invites people to photograph their horizon daily and send it in, to be processed centrally to gain a clearer picture of air pollution around the world., Anyone itching for a bit of escapism without forbidden travel can spend some quality time in central America, courtesy of the Spotting Spider Monkeys project., Spider monkeys are fascinating creatures, very long-lived primates that are slow to reproduce, with each female on average having only one infant every three years. Huge areas of the monkeys’ habitat are being lost to agriculture and other encroachment, with palm oil production one of the leading causes. All spider monkey species are now classed as threatened with extinction., Researchers are now using drones to track spider monkeys through the forest, and using the footage they are developing an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of finding spider monkeys on its own. Before it can get to that stage, however, the systems needs to be fed thousands of images tagged for the presence of spider monkeys, to train the algorithm. This would take years, without the input of citizen scientists who are being asked to look at the images from surveillance cameras and point to the presence of spider monkeys., This will also help researchers track the pattern of habitat loss and deforestation, which are threats to other species as well as the monkeys., Leaving home only once a day for exercise might seem to give little opportunity for outdoor citizen science projects, but you too can do your bit. Photographing blossom on your daily walk will help the National Trust compile a changing gallery of pictures from around the country to delight those who can’t make it to see the spring blooms in person., Hundreds of thousands of people have now joined up with the charity’s #BlossomWatch, either by sending in pictures or looking at what others have contributed. The project was launched last month to emulate hanami, the Japanese custom of celebrating the fleeting sight and scent of blossom., Next year, the National Trust will develop the project further and produce a map to track the blossom across the UK, with a scientific purpose – it will help track climate change, and shed light on the pollinating insect who rely on blossom, and the birds who feed on them in turn., On similar lines, the Nature’s Calendar website run by the Woodland Trust allows people to record when they see their first butterfly or birds of the spring. With 2.9m records currently, it is the biggest biological record of its kind in the UK and ripe for more., Coronavirus lockdowns have cleared the streets of our cities of traffic and people and sent nature and wildlife bounding, splashing and scurrying to fill the vacuum. The City Nature Challenge has run for five years, but this year promises to be different., Participants photograph any form of wildlife – from interesting fungi or even slime mould, to insects and birds, to the traces of animals – droppings, fur, feathers, shells or even carcases. They are uploaded via the iNaturalist app and the online community helps to identify them., It takes place from 24 to 27 April, with the results to be announced on 4 May. The observations gathered become open-source data that will help scientists gauge patterns of global change in natural ecosystems and wildlife., One for the rainy days is a project from Reading University, which will help researchers shed new light on the climate crisis by making local rainfall records of the past digitally accessible, so they can be fed into computer models. Some of Britain’s rainfall and temperature records go back centuries, and this has been invaluable in drawing up detailed pictures of the past climate, and thus computer models used to forecast climate change., But some of these vast hoards of data are still marooned in reams of old-fashioned paper records, and thus effectively unusable. Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning to rescue these obscure rain gauge records, using citizen scientists to do the work. Under the Rainfall Rescue project, volunteers will fill the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing observations from scans of the old paper records., Rainfall is already proving popular: in the first 24 hours after the launch, 450,000 tasks had been completed, reports Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading. “These records will help scientists better understand how and why rainfall varies so much in different locations across the UK. With much of the population facing long spells indoors due to Covid-19, the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide a welcome distraction.”, Coronavirus has highlighted the plight of people in developing countries who struggle with the basics of life, and whose precarious existence could topple over into disaster. One of the ways in which development organisations are hoping to improve people’s lives is through providing safe access to power, for clean cooking and for lighting, that will help children with their learning and adults to earn extra money., The Power To the People project will help train artificial intelligence algorithms to spot buildings from photographs of rural areas in developing countries, which in turn will allow them to be connected to the power grid., Human speech is one of the abiding scientific mysteries, and language development is a fascinating study. Scientists have been recording baby speech, from children aged between three months and four years, whose parents have agreed for them to wear a recorder for several hours each day., The resulting clips can record some of the first sounds babies make. But by their nature, the recordings also capture a lot of background noise, such as parental speech, television or other sources of sound., Armchair researchers can listen to the recordings and identify short clips by their type of sound, to detect which are worth further study. What could be more cheering in isolation than to listen to babies experimenting with speech for the first time?, Coronavirus may be the most pressing health issue globally, but other diseases have not gone away. Tuberculosis is on the rise again, as new drug-resistant bacteria have surged among the poor and vulnerable around the world., Over the next five years, researchers will be collecting more than 100,00 samples from infected patients, and they want to work on testing which antibiotics are still effective, to understand how and where resistance is growing. Nearly 20,000 volunteers have signed up already., Penguin Watch allows sharp-eyed citizen scientists to mark penguins in footage taken in the Antarctic from cameras set up by zoologists near colonies in the region. Penguins are under threat from the climate crisis, pollution, disturbance and fisheries., Monitoring has been inhibited by the difficulty of gaining access to such remote areas, and the ability to crunch through the data that has been collected., Researchers at Oxford University are using people’s penguin spotting assistance to trawl through the collected data and enabling them to gauge the crucial timing of key events in the penguin’s yearly cycle, and tell whether they are changing under the influence of global heating.be a citizen scientist track plastic waste spot a spider monkey or beat coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-691": {"text": "\nBoom time for New Zealand's rats as lockdown gives them free rein in cities\n, With pest controllers in lockdown and a population surge last year, the vermin are free to wreak havoc in populated areas, and on native wildlife, Leni Maiai in Auckland, \n\nSat 18 Apr 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n, Surrounded by ancient rimu trees and the sound of chirping pīwakawaka, Tame Malcolm brings in his second rat of the day from the dense undergrowth of his Auckland backyard. That’s four pests for his tally today – with only a few hundred thousand or so to go., “It’s the first time my whānau family have got to see me doing pest control. I’ve been teaching the whānau that we do this to protect the birds,” says Malcolm, director of Māori-oriented biosecurity business Puna Consultants., For Māori, many of these threatened birds are classed as taonga; a natural treasure with special significance to the culture. “These taonga species are part of our whakapapa genealogical ties. They helped protect our tūpuna ancestors so we have a duty to help them.”, As the autumn leaves fall and crackle, Malcolm would usually be out assisting iwi tribes around the country with urgent pest control measures, with a particular focus on exterminating rats as the winter months loom., Now, like every other New Zealander, Malcolm is stuck at home in the third week of level-four lockdown. Pest control has been deemed a non-essential service by the government; a decision experts say is putting New Zealand’s most vulnerable wildlife at risk, as the number of rats, mice and stoats surges., The timing couldn’t be better for New Zealand’s vermin. They’re coming off 2019’s “mega mast” year, which means bountiful supplies of seed allowed their populations to flourish. Now, with vital pest control efforts halted, there are growing public health concerns as vermin colonise urban areas unchallenged., It also makes the government’s goal to wipe out all pests by 2050 increasingly elusive. The ambitious project aims to restore the country to its pre-human state, a time before introduced pests were able to wreak havoc on its natural biodiversity., Arriving as hitchhikers on settler boats from the 13th century onwards, invasive animals such as rats made easy work of vulnerable bird populations, including the iconic flightless Kiwi which once numbered in the many millions but today languishes below 70,000., Even with the Department of Conservation’s extensive trapping, baiting, and aerial poison drops, 68,000 native birds fall victim to invasive predators every day. As most of these species are endemic to New Zealand, a population wipe-out would mean complete extinction., Rats are the most challenging of all of these predators to manage, with their penchant for swimming, year-round breeding and huge litters. Autumn cooling into winter also means rats are getting cold – and heading indoors., “Food’s running short which means juvenile pests are spreading out to find a new source of food,” says Kevin Hackett, chief conservationist at conservation organisation Forest &amp; Bird., For many hungry vermin their new source of food will come from urban areas and homes, where food is more easily accessible. With restaurants, cafes and takeaways no longer producing the goods, that leaves famished rats one option for dinner – homes., “It’s pretty amazing how many rats are showing up near me and how damn big they are,” says Auckland resident Mikaela Street. “My cat Maurice is arriving at the doorstep with a long-tailed gift most mornings these days.”, The majority of this urban trapping is usually managed by volunteer community groups, but with lockdown restrictions in place, Kiwis have been forced to turn their own hands to keeping rats at bay. In fact, the lockdown has given hunters who are banned from heading into the bush for “the roar” – the deer mating season – a fresh purpose., Renamed “the squeak”, a 28,000-strong online community has blossomed in which hunter is pitted against hunter in a battle to bring in the most impressive rat – a ghoulish project that nonetheless is playing a serious role in resuscitating stalled conservation efforts., “It’s all pretty funny actually,” says competition administrator Brett Collins. “People that would never have thought about catching mice or rats are now making a real concerted effort to get into their backyards and sheds to try and catch these mice and rats, which is going to be doing a lot for our native wildlife.”, The focus on private trapping during lockdown – and the attempt to make it fun – is proving essential to manage unchecked pest populations, says Rachel Fewster from the University of Auckland., Data collected by a University of Auckland project, CatchIT, from 3,000 community groups around the country, indicates a huge fall in the number of rats caught during a traditionally fruitful time of year. In the past week, CatchIT registered just a third of the captures they saw over the same period in the previous two years., Kane Kvasnicka from Restore Hibiscus and Bays, an organisation representing 30 community groups and 155km of coastline in the north of Auckland, worries that the month-long trapping hiatus may prove disastrous for their years of hard work eradicating pests., “We have people and groups that have been out there maintaining trap lines for more than 10 years, so naturally we’re worried sick about the birds and reptiles we’re trying to save,” says Kvasnicka. “Our main effort is to try and bring about the government’s Predator Free 2050 goals, so the kind of impact this might have, especially if the Alert Four period is extended, is pretty concerning.”, Hackwell from Forest &amp; Bird notes this pause in predatory control will be most strongly felt among the high-risk endangered species. Nesting seabirds such as the storm petrel, northern royal albatross, and the kakī are among the most vulnerable., “A lot of projects that have been working very hard to save species and grow numbers could be under real threat at this time of year,” Hackwell says., “Species such as titi or blue penguins are yet to fledge their young, so without the trapping that goes on, they’re very susceptible to being eaten by the likes of ferrets and stoats.”, The Department of Conservation has made arrangements for essential care if wildlife emergencies occur in conservation areas, but they note that the “threshold is high and public safety must come first”. Otherwise, the majority of their pest-eradication plans are on hold indefinitely., For now, Kiwis must turn to their own yards to do their bit in the fight against the onslaught of rats. The dramatic shutdown is no doubt saving lives, but there are fears some precious wildlife may never recover., “We’ve already seen localised extinctions of taonga birds like the kakāriki and kākā as a result of doing nothing to stop invasive species,” says Malcolm., “The lockdown is going to be good for our country in the long run, but at what cost?”, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresboom time for new zealands rats as lockdown gives them free rein in cities aoe", "label": 0}, "train-692": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a portrait of a place through time\n, Warebeth, Orkney: Curlews, lapwings and skylarks announce their presence and add drama to the everyday, \nCal Flyn, \n\nSat 18 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, We quickly fell into a routine after lockdown began, something I never seem to manage normally. These past weeks have taught me that it’s not such a bad thing to tread and retread the same paths. Every day I look at these same hills, these same shores, and every day they show me something new. Over time, these daily walks build up, one upon the other, to create a long view: a portrait of a place through time., A few days ago, for the first time this season, I heard a familiar voice rising above the rest like a flautist. It sang a sliding upwards note which it then repeated, gathering pace, until it hit its rhythmic, rippling peak. I searched the sky for the source: wings outstretched, and that unmistakable bill – a long and slender curved proboscis – less hummingbird than hummingbird moth. A curlew, Numenius arquata, announcing his presence at his breeding ground., He had a distinctive flight pattern too, making a laboured, flapping climb before a smooth and effortless gliding descent. Rising and falling, stitching the air over the marshy meadowland near where the Hoy Sound pounds the coast as he searched for a mate., After a moment, a second voice rose to meet his: revving up just as he had, moving through the gears, escalating to that same bubbling crescendo. A rival, I supposed, but to me they sounded as a well-rehearsed duet, an ode to spring., The following day came the squeeze-toy squall of lapwings, and I spotted their tumbling butterfly flights, flashing white underwings as if showing their bloomers. And from above, piccolo-shrill, the skylark in ascendance, singing his heart out, who rose until he was a black dot in a vibrant sky, then parachuted down., A phenologist will build up records over many years: the dates of the arrivals of new migrants, the opening of flowers, the first frogspawn. I find these daily, government-sanctioned ambles across home ground have sharpened me to such minute developments, the inching forward of the season as it takes uneven, tottering steps towards summer.

In the half century since, climate change has emerged as an existential global threat., But there are still reasons to be hopeful – and this week, the Guardian is joining forces with hundreds of newsrooms around the world to focus attention on creative solutions to the climate emergency, from electric cars to fighting plastic waste to using psychedelic drugs. (Michael Pollan will weigh in.) We’ll also explore lessons from the coronavirus pandemic – and whether the economic crash could create opportunities to rebuild a greener economy., The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded last year by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation to address the urgent need for stronger climate coverage. More than 400 newsrooms from around the world – with a combined audience nearing 2 billion people – have signed on., In the coming days, the Covering Climate Now partners will collectively publish hundreds of stories on climate solutions to create a groundswell of hope at a moment when the world feels bleak. Throughout the week, we’ll be sharing Guardian content with CCN partners for republishing, so that even outlets without dedicated environmental reporters can inform their audiences of the dangers of the climate crisis and opportunities for change. Covering Climate Now has provided financial support for some of our climate reporting this week., The Covering Climate Now network represents every corner of the media, from wire services like Reuters and AFP to newspapers like the Times of India and the Christian Science Monitor, and dozens of local and special-interest outlets, across all mediums, from across the US and world., The Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. This year, the Guardian announced it would no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies, becoming the first major global news organization to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels. Last year, the Guardian updated its style guide to introduce new terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. The Guardian now favors the terms “climate crisis” and “climate emergency” over “climate change”., The Guardian last year also began putting global CO2 levels in the daily weather forecast in its print publication., Covering Climate Now was launched to address a glaring failure by the media to meet the urgency of the climate emergency. Kyle Pope, CCN co-founder and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, writes that in 2018, “broadcast news outlets gave more airtime to the royal baby than to the warming earth”., In 2019, that started to change. “The climate story seemed to be moving from slow to fast, as the effects of the crisis were becoming impossible for even the most stubborn newsrooms to ignore,” Pope writes. “Floods in Venice and droughts in India were ready-made for the evening news. Devastating fires in California and Australia led news broadcasts around the world. Mass protests and their student leaders adorned magazine covers.”, While the project began in the US, Covering Climate Now has quickly gained traction globally and now includes dozens of international news organizations and coverage in multiple languages.

But this bear smelled something better and easier: garbage., Locals named it Mali, in honour of the Mamalilikulla First Nation whose traditional territory encompasses the collection of islands., And as Mali continued to forage for food scraps, conservation officials took notice., The province has a long and often fraught relationship with grizzly bears. Until 2017, trophy hunting was permitted in the province – a deeply divisive practice that had lost public support in previous years. As many as 250 bears, from a population of 15,000, were killed annually., The practice has also divided First Nations: many had provided guiding services for hunters and benefited from the hunt, but other Indigenous communities have grown frustrated with the speed with which conservation officers shoot problem bears., In January, a male grizzly named Gatu appeared in a neighbouring community on the northern tip of Vancouver Island. He became too comfortable around humans. First Nations pleaded with conservation officers to come up with a proactive approach., But their request “just fell on deaf ears” and the bear was shot and killed, said Mike Willie, a wildlife guide and hereditary chief of the Kwikwasut’inuxw Nation., As elsewhere, conservation officers in British Columbia have long taken the view that a habituated bear – one that has lost its fear of humans and is comfortable rummaging for food in urban areas – is effectively a dead bear walking., But when a local guide showed him footage of the new grizzly, Willie hoped this time might be different. Working together and with the non-profit Grizzly Bear Foundation, local First Nations hatched a plan to trap the bear and transport him by helicopter., “We don’t want our bears killed any more. We have the right to govern within our own traditional territories and we have inherent rights and we have title,” said Willie., Conservation officers were initially set on killing the bear, leading to a brief standoff between the two groups. Soon, the province’s environment minister was weighing in, asking all involved to consider a different, non-lethal approach., “Once everything settled down, the conservation officers switched from a kill plan to a relocation plan. And it was amazing really to see them in action,” said Nicholas Scapillati, head of the foundation. “They became very caring about how they could trap this bear and relocate him safely.”, On 13 April, Mali was successfully captured alive and moved to an undisclosed location on the province’s mainland., “Within minutes of waking up, he wasn’t eating garbage. Now he’s in a remote, beautiful estuary, eating sage grass, which is what he should have been doing,” said Scapillati., The province’s minister of environment, George Heyman, praised the result, saying the “desire for reconciliation” with Indigenous peoples helped guide the process., While the bear’s life was saved, locals worry that diminishing food sources, including a decline in salmon, could prompt more bears to make the journey., But for Willie, the success with Mali marks a critical first step in changing what he sees as outdated views of conservation., “It feels that this could be a blueprint to move forward – for us and for other First Nations on the coast,” he said. “It was a really good ending.”grizzly bear canada indigenous conservation british columbia", "label": 0}, "train-695": {"text": "\nNorway and the A-ha moment that made electric cars the answer\n, A country fuelled by hydropower has become the world’s electric vehicle leader, \nJon Henley and \nElisabeth Ulven, \n\nSun 19 Apr 2020 04.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 10.45 EDT\n\n, In 1995, the lead singer of the 1980s band A-ha and the head of the Norwegian environmental group Bellona climbed improbably into a converted electric Fiat Panda they had imported from Switzerland and set off on a road trip., They drove around Oslo refusing to pay the city’s sky-high road tolls, parking illegally wherever they could, and ignoring every penalty notice they were given. Eventually, the authorities impounded their car and auctioned it off to cover the fines., But the stunt attracted massive media attention, and the point was made. Soon after, electric vehicles were exempted from road tolls, one of a large raft of incentives that have, over the years, helped make Norway the country with the world’s highest per capita electric vehicle ownership., Last month, in an economy hit by the coronavirus crisis, fully electric cars accounted for just under 60% of Norway’s new car market, and plug-in hybrids just over 15% – meaning three in four of all new cars sold were either wholly or partly electric., It still has some way to go, but the country looks on course to meet a government target – set in 2016, with full cross-party parliamentary support – of phasing out the sale of all new fossil-fuel based cars and light commercial vehicles by 2025., “It’s actually quite amazing how fast the mindset’s changed,” said Christina Bu of the Norwegian EV Electric Vehicle Association. “Even in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric.”, The story of how and why that has happened has a straightforward, if unexpected logic. First, despite being a major oil and gas producer, almost all of Norway’s domestic energy comes from a single, and renewable, source: hydropower., Even in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric, That means switching to EVs is a much greener option for Norway than for countries whose power is generated mostly by coal plants – and that if it wants to significantly reduce its emission levels, it has little choice but to green its transport sector., Driven by the environmental imperative, the government began offering incentives to buy and run electric cars as far back as 1990, first by introducing a temporary exemption from Norway’s exorbitant vehicle purchase tax, which became permanent six years later., “This was an important step,” Bu said. “Norway was a very poor country before we discovered oil; cars were a luxury item. They’ve always been taxed very highly. Cars in Norway are a lot more expensive than elsewhere. Without the purchase tax, the cost of an electric car basically fell to that of an ordinary car.”, Since then, electric car drivers have been given the right to park for free in some municipal car parks, drive in bus lanes, take ferries without a ticket and, thanks to A-ha, drive toll-free. They are not required to pay VAT on their cars, or road tax, and company electric cars are taxed at a lower rate than petrol or diesel vehicles., Some measures have changed over the years: to be allowed to drive in a bus lane, for example, you now need to be carrying a passenger. A so-called 50% rule was introduced in 2017, allowing local authorities to charge EV drivers up to 50% of the parking fees, road tolls and ferry rates applicable to fossil-fuel vehicles., But overall, said Bu, the “combination of a big one-off saving when you buy the car, plus the substantially lower costs – fuel, tolls, parking, maintenance – of actually driving it, still adds up to a very powerful financial argument. Over its lifetime, you really save a lot of money with an electric car in Norway.”, That was certainly what persuaded Wenche Charlotte Egelund, 57, who bought a VW Golf Electric with her partner two years ago when they moved out of central Oslo. “The incentives were crucial,” she said. “The tax and VAT exemptions, free municipal parking, free toll roads that mean we avoid the rush-hour traffic jams.”, In fact, Egelund said, the incentives were so significant that she almost “felt the decision was imposed on me. Financially, it was like there was no other sensible option. I do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?”, Rachel Ritman, 56, a postwoman living on the outskirts of Fredrikstad, bought her Opel Ampera two years ago and said she has not regretted her choice, even if she was “not sure we would have gone electric without the incentives”. The car’s range was good, she said: 250 miles (400km) in summer, 200 miles (320km) in winter and because she charges at home she does not suffer from “lade-angst”, or the fear of running out of juice., Both Ritman and Egelund have a second, diesel-powered car for extra-long journeys, to country cabins or holidays. Sten Bråthen, 55, a media consultant, bought his Nissan Leaf as a second car “for taking the children around and driving to work. But there were so many advantages that when we were getting a new main car last year we didn’t think twice about going electric.”, Government incentives were vital in the decision to buy, Bråthen said: “I think we would have managed without the other incentives – free toll roads and parking – but the actual cost of buying was so much lower than ordinary cars here in Norway.” He warned, though, that Norway was going to need more charging stations., Despite the incentives, EV sales in Norway remained low until about 2010, when a number of smaller, more affordable electric cars from makers such as Mitsubishi and Nissan came to market, and improved technology meant larger electric cars began to offer both the space and range to make them a sensible choice for families., I do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?, Bu said the incentives were so significant that “many people say they’ve bought the most expensive car they’ve ever had when they buy electric – Teslas, Jaguars, that kind of model – simply because they’ve calculated what kind of saving they’re going to be making over the coming years, and feel it makes sense”., That has led to accusations that Norway’s encouragement of electric vehicles amounts to little more than tax cuts for the rich, or a cut-price second car. Many Norwegians on lower incomes can only dream of owning an electric car, and three out of four car purchases are on the secondhand market., Bu – whose organisation represents consumers rather than producers – rejected this, arguing that “we have to change the cars we drive, and the only way to do that is to change the new cars. We can’t change used ones”. EVs will soon make up 10% of Norway’s passenger fleet, she said, and are slowly coming on to the used market., She said she was confident for the future of electric vehicles, even in countries without a big renewable power sector, and studies show that EVs running on power generated from fossil fuel are responsible for roughly the same level of overall CO2 emissions as petrol cars., “As a society, we clearly have to do two things,” she said. “Produce more renewable energy and products – like cars – that can run on it,” she said. “We have to do both, as fast as possible. We can’t hang around until we’re producing 100% renewable energy.”, Electric cars are “never going to be truly environmentally friendly”, Bu said. “The main problem is making the batteries. We need clean battery producers in Europe. But look, we need transport. We need cars and vans, particularly outside our cities. And for us, electric is the answer.”, This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism., But experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration’s decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission’s damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill., Frances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill., “Disasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you’re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,” she said. “There are a lot of things that can go wrong.”, Frances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries., “Of course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was 10 years prior,” Beinecke said. , Richard Sears, the commission’s senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but “there are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deep water”., “Everybody has to stay vigilant,” Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but the government could do more to limit industry risk., Outside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization., In the wake of the BP disaster, the US interior department restructured in an effort to allow a new division of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling., The Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig., Now Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry’s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors., Trump has pushed an agenda of “energy dominance”, which critics say encourages industry to take risks., A constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US – more than 1bn acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico., His officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE’s director repeatedly calling them “partners”., “BSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,” the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August 2017., Internal emails suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns. Staffers at BSEE who spoke anonymously to E&amp;E News depict a “broken” agency run by Angelle, who is a former Louisiana politician and longtime supporter of the Gulf oil industry., “BSEE is focused on ensuring energy development is conducted in a safe and smart manner,” a spokesman, Sandy Day, told the Guardian, maintaining that the industry was vastly different from what it was 10 years ago., “BSEE is committed to its mission to promote safety, protect the environment and conserve offshore resources through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement,” said Day, adding: “Safety is a top priority for the Trump administration’s oversight of OCS outer continental shelf operations, and BSEE has significantly increased safety performance in comparison to the Obama administration through increased inspections and more effective use of data.”, Meanwhile, drillers have moved farther and deeper offshore, pursuing wells with enough oil to produce for decades, known in the industry as “elephants”. Low oil prices – from a boom in production on land following the discovery of fracking – haven’t kept them out of the water. Most of the $93m in leases sold by the US in the Gulf last month were in deep water., “Offshore drilling is going after bigger and bigger wells that have more and more oil,” said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council who co-wrote a book on the BP disaster. “These are being drilled in deep water and they’re being drilled in high pressure wells that are harder to control. And they’re being drilled in more complex geology.”, One study found that for every 100ft deeper a well is drilled, documented incidents increase 8.5%., The Deepwater Horizon rig reached about 5,000ft, or close to a mile, down. Other platforms still operating in the Gulf are as deep or deeper. One drilled in 2001, called “Blind Faith”, is still producing, according to 2019 documents from Chevron. It reaches 7,000ft to the Gulf floor., Deans called the current regulatory approach “an honor system” that “smacks of exactly the kind of self-enforcement that the independent commission found to be a fatal flaw” in the BP blowout., “Definitely, it could happen again,” he said. “You cannot make these operations safe. All you can do is try to reduce the risk.”, Smaller-scale incidents that don’t make the news occur frequently in the Gulf. Between 2007 and 2018, there were an average of 115 fires and explosions in federal waters annually, about one every three days, according to government data reviewed by the environment campaign Oceana. There were also nearly 50 fatalities over that time., Donald Boesch, a biological oceanographer and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, who was also on the commission, said Trump’s changes have undermined offshore safety., “Many steps have been taken by both government and industry since the accident 10 years ago … I felt comfortable – not that the risk was reduced to negligible – but that we were in better shape now than we were,” Boesch said. “I’ve frankly been made more concerned about how the safety issues are being treated under the Trump administration.”, Still, sources familiar with industry say the big companies learned a lesson as they watched BP suffer huge reputational damage and pay $65bn for its mistakes., Wesley Williams, a petroleum engineering professor at Louisiana State University, who was awarded a nearly $5m research grant from a fund BP was forced to pay into, said the “real motivator” for industry was “the image issue that happened and the financial cost of what happened to BP”., “From the large operators, I’ve seen a big change in safety culture,” Williams said., But the sector consists of more than just the brands most people can identify, like BP, Shell and Exxon. Those companies work with large networks of contractors, and smaller independent operators are active in the Gulf of Mexico too. Williams said they did not always have the resources for extensive safety training., John Amos, president of SkyTruth, a not-for-profit conservation technology organization, said:, “The next major oil spill, when it happens, will catch us off guard … like every previous one has, unless we decide that this time it’s going to be different,” Amos said.deepwater horizon 10 years later could it happen again", "label": 0}, "train-697": {"text": "Hopes of saving Kangaroo Island dunnart raised after endangered marsupial captured on camera, Bushfires reduced numbers from 500 to 50 but newly discovered populations are cause for optimism, conservationists say , Hopes that Kangaroo Island’s unique mouse-like dunnart can be saved from extinction have been boosted after the tiny marsupial was captured on camera at a new location., More than 90% of the threatened Kangaroo Island dunnart’s habitat was burned in bushfires in early January., Now conservationists are focusing efforts on an unburnt patch and are working around the clock to set sensor cameras, build protective tunnels and trap feral cats that have moved into the area in the island’s west., New sensor cameras have detected dunnarts at three locations on a 222-hectare private property in the north-west of the island – one of 10 properties that are part of the unburnt area that’s only a few thousand hectares., Ecologist Heidi Groffen, of Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife, said the unburnt patch was “incredibly important” for the future of the species and she was “jumping for joy” when the cameras spotted the dunnarts., “These images prove that this property is supporting a dunnart population,” she said. “It’s exciting and a credit to farm fire units and firefighters that this critical habitat escaped the flames, as surrounding properties to the south, east and west were badly burned.”, Darren Grover, of WWF-Australia, which funded the new camera traps, said: “This is a species that won’t survive without a helping hand., “That’s why it’s so important to monitor and manage threats in these few sites that are providing a refuge for the remaining dunnarts.”, The Kangaroo Island Dunnart – weighing only about 25 grams – was already critically endangered before the fires, with estimates there were fewer than 500 remaining. But after the fire, Griffin says this number may be as low as 50., After the fires, Groffen says that feral cats moved into the unburnt areas and were now a key threat to the dunnart’s survival., “We now have cat traps open that surround this bushland and a full-time staff member just working to trap them. I don’t think the cats were hit at all by the fires. We’ve caught more than 30 around one fence line at Western River., “Considering that property had been managed for cats, it shows how the cats survived and are on the move looking for unburnt areas. This cat control is our number one priority. One cat could wipe out a whole population.”, Cats that are caught are euthanised, Groffen said, and their stomachs examined for clues about what species they have been preying on., At the same time, small protective tunnels with entrances too small for cats and other predators like raptors and goannas have been installed to give a refuge to dunnarts and other threatened species. The camera traps have also caught the dunnarts using the tunnels., Dunnarts are elusive creatures that live in burrows. Groffen admitted that even though she had been working to protect them for three years, she has still only ever seen one on a camera image., But she said they were hoping to secure more funds to be able to trap and tag dunnarts to give ecologists more information about their numbers and where they might be.hopes of saving kangaroo island dunnart raised after endangered marsupial captured on camera", "label": 0}, "train-698": {"text": "\n'Horrible hybrids': the plastic products that give recyclers nightmares\n, From singing birthday cards to baby food pouches, a growing trend of mixing materials is making recycling even harder, \nErin McCormick, \n\nMon 20 Apr 2020 11.22 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 11.42 EDT\n\n, The cheerful, singing voice inside your musical “Happy Birthday” card is enough to strike horror in the heart of your local recycler., The musical cards, which play a recording when opened, look like plain cardboard, making them easy to accidentally throw in the recycling bin. But experts say the insides are laced with cheap electronics and toxic batteries – making them a nightmare to dispose of., Such cards are just one example of what recyclers say is a growing trend in mixing different materials to create new types of products and packaging, which is making the work of recovering reusable products much harder., “I call them ‘horrible hybrids’,” said Heidi Sanborn, who heads up the National Stewardship Action Council, a network of groups that seeks to get manufacturers to take responsibility for the proper disposal of the products they sell. “They are made of multiple materials or materials that are impossible to recycle. It’s a mushing of things.”, Discarded single-use plastics have become an international environmental flashpoint, as they have turned up in the bellies of birds and fish, flooded pristine beaches in remote countries with litter and even been detected in microscopic quantities in rainwater. Plastic products designed to be used for a few minutes can take decades or longer to decompose., Studies have also shown the proliferation of single-use plastic is accelerating climate change through greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its lifecycle. While environmental groups fighting to reduce the use of throwaway plastics have gained visibility in the last few years, the oil industry is investing heavily in a huge surge of plastic production – which the industry expects to grow by 40% by 2030. The increase in plastics production is to be fueled by the ultra-cheap shale gas flowing from the US fracking boom. The petro-chemical industry has already invested $200bn to build new cracking plants that separate ethane from gas to produce the ethylene needed to make plastics. Another $100bn in investments is planned., Industry often points to recycling as the solution to all those new plastics. Yet only a fraction of plastic products end up recycled, a problem that was exacerbated when China shut its doors in 2018 to the deluge of plastics from other countries that it had previously been recycling., The US municipalities and recyclers are scrambling to increase the amount of recycling they can do domestically. But these new formulations of hybrid packaging – items mixing materials like foil, paper and sometimes multiple types of plastics – stymie recycling solutions and mostly just end up in the trash., Examples include shoes and clothing embedded with electronics; the increasingly popular flexible plastic pouches used to package things like detergent pods, rice and baby food; and recyclable bottles and cans tightly wrapped in extra plastic labeling., Singing cards and other products with tiny electronics inside them are especially vexing to recyclers. Not only do they include toxic electronic waste, but when the small batteries get crushed in the machinery inside recycling plants, they have been frequently known to cause fires., “One of the biggest problems for recyclers right now is all the products containing lithium ion batteries, such as the singing cards, balloons and other novelty products,” said Kate Bailey, the director of research at Eco-Cycle, a Boulder, Colorado, recycler. “These batteries can spark easily when they get caught in the processing equipment or run over by a front-end loader, and these sparks can lead to disastrous fires in the recycling center.”, Recyclers are urging manufacturers to simplify the products they make to make it easy to recycle them. But they say consumers can also help by searching for more recyclable products – and then voting with their dollars., Bad: singing greeting cardsBetter: regular cardboard cardsBest: cards made from recycled paper or E-cards, Bad: musical mylar balloonsBetter: colorful pinwheelsBest: edible bouquets, Bad: tennis shoes with light-up wheelsBetter: regular tennis shoesBest: shoes made of natural or recycled materials, Another growing menace for recyclers are the plastic pouches increasingly used to hold everything from laundry detergent pods to cereals and juices. This flexible packaging is made with many thin layers of different types and colors of plastic and is sometimes layered with foil and wax., Manufacturers and plastic producers tout these pouches for making packages smaller, reducing shipping costs and increasing the shelf life of foods. “A few thin, carefully chosen layers mean more value, less footprint,” says a video by the plastic producer lobbying group, the American Chemistry Council, promoting such pouches., But recyclers say they are pretty much impossible to recycle. And they are apt to end up in the ocean and take decades to biodegrade. When choosing laundry detergent, they say, consumers might look for products in unlined boxes or try new formulations such as concentrated detergent strips, which require no plastic packaging., Bad: detergent pods packaged in film plastic bagBetter: detergent in recyclable see-thru plastic jugs or cardboard boxBest: laundry detergent strips, Bad: Baby food sold in plastic pouchesBetter: The old recyclable glass jarsBest: Make your own from fresh fruits and vegetables, Another bugaboo for recyclers is the increasing use of non-recyclable wrappers around perfectly recyclable bottles and cans. For instance most spray cleaners come in bottles made of high-density polyethylene, which can be readily recycled. But first consumers must remove the spraytops, as they are made from different plastics and are not recyclable. Then consumers must find a way to pry off the brightly-colored, printed plastic wraps that packagers are increasingly wrapping around bottles to make the labeling more attractive., “Who does all that? Nobody,” said Sanborn. “We’ve made recycling too complicated. Who has the time to read a manual for everything they get rid of?”, Instead consumers can look for clear-colored or white bottles with the labeling printed on the bottle itself. It’s even better if they choose brands committed to using recycled plastic to make these bottles, such as Method cleaning products. Another great option is for customers to mix their own cleaners and reuse the plastic bottles., Bad: plastic spray bottle wrapped with an extra layer of printed plasticBetter: white or transparent bottle without the extra wrapBest: make your own cleaner and refill the bottles, Bad: beer cans with plastic wraps or vinyl stickersBetter: regular, very recyclable cans, Sanborn says that the best recycling outcomes happen when companies pay to create programs to make sure the waste from their products gets recycled in the end. Such programs are often mandatory in other countries. In the US, a few companies are promoting this type of effort voluntarily, such as a program to recycle plastic disposable razors coordinated by the company Gillete in partnership with the recycling enterprise, Terracycle. The program allows consumers to mail in their razors to be recycled., “We should have it so these companies have to have an end-of-life system for all their products,” said Sanborn. “That’s producer responsibility.”, This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Many studies have linked NO2 exposure to health damage, and particularly lung disease, which could make people more likely to die if they contract Covid-19., “The results indicate that long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the Covid-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world,” said Yaron Ogen, at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany, who conducted the research. “Poisoning our environment means poisoning our own body, and when it experiences chronic respiratory stress its ability to defend itself from infections is limited.”, The analysis is only able to show a strong correlation, not a causal link. “It is now necessary to examine whether the presence of an initial inflammatory condition is related to the response of the immune system to the coronavirus,” Ogen said., A separate study published on 7 April looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates. Another recent paper noted that the high death rates seen in the north of Italy correlated with the highest levels of air pollution., The new research, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, compared NO2 levels in January and February in 66 administrative regions with Covid-19 deaths recorded up to 19 March. Ogen also assessed the atmospheric conditions to see where pollution was being trapped over the regions., He found that 78% of the 4,443 deaths were in four regions in northern Italy and one around Madrid in Spain. These five regions had the worst combination of NO2 levels and airflow conditions that prevented dispersal of air pollution., Ogen noted that the Po Valley in Italy and Madrid were surrounded by mountains, which helps trap pollution, as is Hubei province in China, where the pandemic began. “However, my research is only an initial indication that there might be a correlation between the level of air pollution, air movement and the severity of the course of the corona outbreaks,” he said., Prof Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, said the study showed an association between Covid-19 deaths and NO2 levels. “This association could reflect a causal link between exposure to air pollution and increased vulnerability to fatal Covid infection, but other factors cannot be ruled out at this stage. For example, the study does not adjust for differences in age distribution in different areas.”, Widespread lockdowns around the world have led to reduced vehicle traffic and air pollution. However, long-term exposure to dirty air before the pandemic may be more important than current levels of pollution., In the UK, NO2 has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last decade. A key policy to reduce NO2 levels is the introduction of clean air zones, where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres. But the introduction of some CAZs has been postponed  because of the coronavirus crisis., Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This new study is worrying. We know NO2 is a toxic gas that inflames the lining of the lungs and reduces immunity to lung infections, so it may not be surprising that people who have suffered in areas with high levels of NO2 could be more susceptible to coronavirus., “This is all the more reason to keep traffic and pollution levels down as much as possible now and get out of this terrible situation with a view to fewer but cleaner vehicles on the road.” air pollution may be key contributor to covid 19 deaths study", "label": 0}, "train-700": {"text": "'No way food safety not compromised': US regulation rollbacks during Covid-19 criticised, Major pork plant closed after hundreds of workers contract coronavirus, while speeding up of poultry production lines raises concerns over standards, The US government is accelerating controversial regulatory rollbacks to speed up production at meat plants, as companies express growing alarm at the impact of Covid-19 on their operations., Last week Smithfield shut down one of the largest pork plants in the country after hundreds of employees contracted the coronavirus. The plant in South Dakota – whose output represents 4–5% of US pork production – is reported to be the largest single-source coronavirus hotspot in the US, with more than 600 cases. In response, the company said it was “critical” for the meat industry to “continue to operate unabated”. Now it has emerged that as a wave of plants announce closures, US meat plants are being granted permission to increase the speed of their production lines. This comes despite warnings that the waivers for higher speeds on slaughter and processing lines will compromise food safety., The latest line speed increases, announced by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) mean 11 poultry plants have been given waivers to operate higher line speeds in the past fortnight. A number of beef and pork plants have also been given waivers, including a beef plant in Kansas in late March. The move will allow the additional chicken factories to slaughter as many as 175 birds a minute – the equivalent of 3 per second.A union representing federal food safety inspectors has said faster lines will make it harder to catch “pathology that shouldn’t be going out to the consumers”., “There is no way that food safety is not compromised when the sole trained government inspector on the slaughter line in a chicken plant is expected to examine three birds every second,” said Tony Corbo, senior government affairs representative at Food &amp; Water Watch. “The US government has stepped on the accelerator to grant these waivers while everyone is concentrating on the Covid-19 epidemic.”A spokesperson for the FSIS accused campaigners of “spreading fear among the American public”. “The agency’s decisions on granting line speed waiver requests are based on data gathered under the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)-based Inspection Models Project (HIMP) pilot study. The 20-year pilot showed that online inspectors in HIMP young chicken establishments were able to conduct an effective online inspection of each carcass when operating at a line speed of up to 175 bpm and that HIMP establishments were able to control for pathogens at the line speeds authorized under HIMP.”, Increased line speeds are supported by the poultry industry, which argues they do not represent additional risk to food or workers safety, and are necessary to remain financially competitive. Three years ago the National Chicken Council lobbied the government to scrap line speed limits completely, calling them “arbitrary”., Under traditional poultry processing rules, line speeds ran at 140 birds a minute, and required at least four inspectors to be stationed on each line, tasked with checking carcasses for defects, disease or contamination, including fecal matter which can cause salmonella. That has since been reduced to one inspector per line, with individual regulatory waivers enabling line speed increases.“It potentially reduces some of the quality control efforts, but I am not concerned about worker safety as a result of the increased line speeds. Some plants are actually reducing speeds because of employee absenteeism,” said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst at IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence., The line speed increases come as Guardian data analysis reveals that at least one in 10 US poultry slaughterhouses failed government salmonella tests last year. In some categories, failure rates are as high as 34%., Targets to reduce salmonella disease outbreaks have also been missed, with a rise of 9% in the incidence rate over the last three years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). , Campaigners have filed a petition with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), demanding that it declare certain types of salmonella in meat products adulterants (meaning producers have an obligation to withhold contaminated batches), because they “constitute an imminent threat to public health necessitating prompt agency action”., “We’ve been playing around with these standards for 20 years now,” said Corbo, one of the parties to the petition, “and it doesn’t seem to be working in terms of reducing the amount of food-borne illness in this country. People are getting sick from our poultry production system, and we think that is a public health emergency.”, The FSIS has made attempts to bring down salmonella levels and reduce food-borne illness. The FSIS pointed out to the Guardian that the number of establishments in category three it has a rating system to encourage improvement has been halved since 2017. But a Guardian analysis of the FSIS’s reports for the last year shows that for chicken carcass plants, an average 11.8% of inspected plants still failed the standard. ,  , In 2011, when the FSIS set a target to reduce food-borne illness, the incidence level for salmonella was estimated at around 16.4 people per 100,000. The FSIS’s plan aimed to reduce that number to 11.4 by this year, but instead, after a small decline over five years, it has now risen to 18.3, according to a CDC spokesperson., Outbreak numbers are rising too. A report by US consumer organisation PIRG found that meat and poultry recalls are up by 65% since 2013. Meanwhile a report by the CDC highlighted the rise in antibiotic-resistant salmonella as a serious threat that requires “prompt and sustained action”., A spokesperson for the Chicken Council disagreed with criticisms of the sector. He told the Guardian: “No one wants to reduce salmonella more than the companies producing our food. Our families eat the same chicken.” The council opposes the petition, he stated. “We agree with FSIS, and previous court rulings, that a science-based, multitiered approach aimed at reducing all salmonella on raw meat and poultry products results in a more appropriate and effective use of agency resources compared to a separate and specific focus on specific individual strains.”, Campaigners say the FSIS is limited in its ability to keep US meat and poultry healthy. A critical report on the FSIS by the US Government Accountability Office in 2018 stated that a review of data had shown that “some plants are still not meeting pathogen standards – in some cases repeatedly not meeting the standards – and are allowed to operate”. It also pointed out that the agency still had no mandatory recall authority., no way food safety not compromised us regulatory roll backs during covid 19 criticised", "label": 0}, "train-701": {"text": "\nGreen energy could drive Covid-19 recovery with $100tn boost\n, Speeding up investment could deliver huge gains to global GDP by 2050 while tackling climate emergency, says report, \nJillian Ambrose, \n\nMon 20 Apr 2020 06.41 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 21.01 EDT\n\n, Renewable energy could power an economic recovery from Covid-19 by spurring global GDP gains of almost $100tn (£80tn) between now and 2050, according to a report., The International Renewable Energy Agency found that accelerating investment in renewable energy could generate huge economic benefits while helping to tackle the global climate emergency., The agency’s director general, Francesco La Camera, said the global crisis ignited by the coronavirus outbreak exposed “the deep vulnerabilities of the current system” and urged governments to invest in renewable energy to kickstart economic growth and help meet climate targets., The agency’s landmark report found that accelerating investment in renewable energy would help tackle the climate crisis and would in effect pay for itself., Investing in renewable energy would deliver global GDP gains of $98tn above a business-as-usual scenario by 2050 by returning between $3 and $8 on every dollar invested., It would also quadruple the number of jobs in the sector to 42m over the next 30 years, and measurably improve global health and welfare scores, according to the report., “Governments are facing a difficult task of bringing the health emergency under control while introducing major stimulus and recovery measures,” La Camera said. “By accelerating renewables and making the energy transition an integral part of the wider recovery, governments can achieve multiple economic and social objectives in the pursuit of a resilient future that leaves nobody behind.”, The report also found that renewable energy could curb the rise in global temperatures by helping to reduce the energy industry’s carbon dioxide emissions by 70% by 2050 by replacing fossil fuels., Renewables could play a greater role in cutting carbon emissions from heavy industry and transport to reach virtually zero emissions by 2050, particularly by investing in green hydrogen., The clean-burning fuel, which can replace the fossil fuel gas in steel and cement making, could be made by using vast amounts of clean electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen elements., Andrew Steer, chief executive of the World Resources Institute, said: “As the world looks to recover from the current health and economic crises, we face a choice: we can pursue a modern, clean, healthy energy system, or we can go back to the old, polluting ways of doing business. We must choose the former.”, The call for a green economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis comes after a warning from Dr Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, that government policies must be put in place to avoid an investment hiatus in the energy transition., “We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition,” he said. “We have an important window of opportunity.”, Ignacio Galán, the chairman and CEO of the Spanish renewables giant Iberdrola, which owns Scottish Power, said the company would continue to invest billions in renewable energy as well as electricity networks and batteries to help integrate clean energy in the electricity., “A green recovery is essential as we emerge from the Covid-19 crisis.

Not if you can afford it\n, \nWill climate change end waterfront living? Not if you can afford it\n, Developers are creating waterfront homes in Boston with innovative seawall defences but is this a model for other cities? Or a sign of climate gentrification? , \nOliver Milman in Boston, \n\nMon 20 Apr 2020 06.15 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 10.43 EDT\n\n, Boston has endured several tumultuous eras, from being the birthplace of the American revolution to its seesawing fortunes as power and influence was wrested away by other US cities., Now Boston faces its most existential threat yet – the rising seas., Ironically, Boston is experiencing a surge in waterfront development at the very moment its growing risk to disastrous flooding becomes clear. The refashioning of Boston’s waterfront holds valuable lessons to other cities threatened by sea level rise – in terms of innovation but also wrenching concerns over displaced communities., The economics are now optimal for developers to repurpose the post-industrial landscape of East Boston and other neighbourhoods in the city but this epoch also comes comes with the added costs of the climate crisis., “It is an unfortunate quirk of timing,” admitted Nick Iselin, the general manager of development at Lendlease. Last summer, the property company completed the first phase of its Clippership Wharf development in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront. Nearly all of the 284 apartments have already been snapped up, with a second site in the same project set to be completed this year. In all, there will be 478 residencies on the seven-acre site., City authorities are planning around a contingency of 40 inches of sea level rise by 2070 – a scenario that would inundate large swathes of Boston., The seeds of Boston’s vulnerability to the climate crisis was unknowingly sown as the city became a bustling trading port in the 1800s. The booming city tripled in geographic land area by filling in tidal flats and marshland with rocks and dirt, using this land for residential housing as well as sights such as Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium. Planes landing at Boston’s Logan international airport rumble along filled-in land that was once a string of islands., The core of the city is perched on low-lying land along a lengthy artificial shoreline – a perilous situation in an era when seawater is piling up along the US east coast from the heating-up of the seas and the melting of glaciers. Boston is now the world’s eighth most vulnerable coastal city to potential damages from sea level rise, according to the World Bank., The sea that laps at Boston rose by nine inches over the past century, with diverse districts such as Dorchester facing the prospect of being drowned by the end of the century. Already, some Boston streets flood even on sunny days, just with the high tide., Developers in Boston are attempting to stare down this challenge, however. Clippership Wharf is flanked by two other expensive developments in varying stages of construction, both using standard forms of reinforced seawalls and barriers to stop their investments becoming inundated., But Lendlease is embracing an approach more attuned to nature, one that leans upon the idea of living with the encroaching water rather than waging war against it – an ethos more common in the Netherlands or Venice than the US. Clippership Wharf has Boston Harbor’s first “living shoreline” – a network of natural plantings, salt marshes, rocky beaches and wildlife habitats aimed at dissipating waves from storms and subtly taming the high tides., You get from the condos to the waterfront via a series of tiered grassy embankments that bring you down to a publicly-accessible boardwalk overlooking a jumble of rocks and, on one side, the remnants of an antiquated seawall that has been partially given over to the water and seeded with salt marshes to provide a more natural buffer to the advancing harbor., Seawalls, by contrast, often cause the erosion of land or beach in front of them and can simply push water on to neighbouring properties. In many ways, this Boston development is a model for how America should be building on the coastline in an age of climate breakdown., “We’ve repatriated the shoreline with native species, this is more like what it would have been 150 years ago,” Iselin said. “In four or five years you’ll see the salt marsh starting to take shape., “I think it takes a certain caliber of developer to think that way, but I think more and more developers are. The challenge is not thinking that way, it’s figuring out a way to implement it because the solutions are more difficult, both from a regulatory perspective and from a cost perspective.”, The developers haven’t left too much to chance – Clippership Wharf has been elevated to 14ft above the average high tide in the harbor, which waxes and wanes every six hours. Deployable wooden barriers are slotted into place ahead of a storm, while an underground car garage includes water pumps and an emergency back-up generator., These adaptions caused consternation among city authorities about a gradient mismatch with surrounding streets but the inclines are fairly gentle and are still wheelchair-accessible., A more potent concern is that the climate crisis is accelerating existing gentrification of what was once a solidly working class area. Apartments at Clippership Wharf will cost you about $5,500 a month for three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m., These new abodes are built on a site that was vacant for 30 years, a patch of contaminated soil left over from the heyday of the harbor being a frenzy of goods shipped on to wharves that stretched out into the water. Lendlease has clearly done a sterling job of opening up a waterfront path to the general public, but the “perception of gentrification is very real”, Iselin conceded., Boston has one of the more progressive city leaderships when it comes to the climate crisis – its Climate Ready Boston plan sets out the challenge in detailed and stark terms – but, still, low-income residents of East Boston worry that they will be the worst hit when the water starts lapping on to roads and into basements., The city has had one near miss – Superstorm Sandy, which crunched into New York City in 2012, would have left many Bostonians hip-deep in water had it arrived at high, rather than low, tide. Some residents, not shielded by the expansive defenses and water pumps of the new developments, fear they won’t be so lucky next time., “Where I live was built in 2003 and that was not built to be climate resilient – all the critical utilities are in the basement, which could flood,” said Magdalena Ayed, the founder of environmental justice group the Harborkeepers who lives in subsidized housing just a few hundred feet from Clippership Wharf. “The question is where does the water go (from the new development), will it go in and behind to us?”, Originally from Argentina, Ayed moved to Boston 14 years ago and has seen East Boston’s waterfront rapidly change into a place where only the relatively wealthy, perhaps working in Boston’s growing biotech sector, are able to afford. The new developments will only push up rents for everyone else, she worries., “Boston was built on the backs of hardworking people, we are a hub of immigrants – Ukrainians, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Vietnamese, Latinos and north Africans,” Ayed said. “That’s still the case but it’s changing. I don’t even make a living wage, I wish I could afford to live in one of these new buildings but I can’t. I probably won’t be able to ever afford it.”, Ayed said that Lendlease “deserves a lot of credit” for thoughtfully protecting its patch of the shoreline but said she’s worried about the impact of flooding upon the elderly and less mobile in the public housing behind the new developments. In 2018, two nasty storms threatened to flood East Boston homes, with public transport grinding to a halt., “The bigger question is whether we should even be building in these flood zones,” Ayed said. “The whole managed retreat issue is the elephant in the room.”, Boston, a famously feisty city not prone to meek surrender, certainly isn’t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront. The mayor, Marty Walsh, has committed 10% of the city’s budget to making Boston more resilient to climate change, through a series of efforts to raise pathways, erect seawalls and install natural barriers known as berms. A competing idea, to creating an enormous harbor barrier costing around $12bn, has been shelved., The task of transforming Boston into a modern, climate-adapted place while not pushing out its long-term working class is a conundrum that is set to play out in other cities along America’s eastern seaboard. The issue of climate gentrification is already starting to bite in Miami, for example, where minority communities long established on higher ground have complained they are being inundated by shiny new apartment blocks for wealthy residents who are seeking safer ground., “As we look at resilience, equity has to be at the heart of it,” said Christopher Cook, Boston’s chief of environment, energy and open space, who pointed to several projects around Boston aimed at protecting low-income neighborhoods rather than displacing them., “Success is giving everyone equal access to the harbor. The real benefit of nature based solutions is that they can be adaptive, you can give socially vulnerable populations a recreation space. Seawalls can’t do that. But we have to be concerned (about gentrification). If this is all just for wealthy people we won’t have been successful.”, Even for a city with a detailed plan, there are gaps to fill in. Boston can require developers to erect berms, for example, but who then is responsible for maintaining them? If developers are left to protect their own plot of land, how do you best ensure there is a coherent, joined-up response to sea level rise along the whole waterfront? Who pays for all of this?, Big cities like Boston can muddle through a lot of these questions themselves but the vast US coastline faces a hopefully mismatched response to the swelling seas. There is no overarching federal government strategy to deal with sea level rise, a phenomena that’s on course to displace an astounding 13 million Americans, according to a University of Georgia in Athens study, with the Trump administration dismantling the few federal requirements to build with the climate crisis in mind., “The challenge is enormous, so much so that it could be paralyzing,” said Cook. “We’ve taken on challenges over time, though, and this is just the next stage in this., “But we do need strong federal leadership – frankly we needed it 10 years ago. Washington DC needs to focus on protecting coastal cities, because a lot of them don’t have the flexibility we do.”, This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

No such nests had been found for the previous five years., “If we compare to the year before, we didn’t have this many spawn, because turtles have a high risk of getting killed by fishing gear and humans disturbing the beach.”, Leatherbacks are the world’s largest sea turtles. They are considered endangered in Thailand, and listed as a vulnerable species globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature., They lay their eggs in dark and quiet areas, scarce when tourists thronged the beaches. People have also been known to dig into their nests and steal eggs., Late in March, staff at a national park in the southern province of Phang Nga, bordering the Andaman Sea, found 84 hatchlings after monitoring eggs for two months.coronavirus lockdown boosts numbers of thailands rare sea turtles", "label": 0}, "train-704": {"text": "\nEPA faces court over backing of Monsanto's controversial crop system\n, The ninth circuit court of appeals is being asked to overturn the EPA’s approval of a Monsanto herbicide that is allegedly a threat to farm crops across the US, \nCarey Gillam, \n\nMon 20 Apr 2020 05.06 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 05.47 EDT\n\n, The US Environmental Protection Agency is due in federal court on Tuesday to answer allegations that it broke the law to support a Monsanto system that has triggered “widespread” crop damage over the last few summers and continues to threaten farms across the country., As farmers prepare to plant a new season of key American food crops, farmer and consumer groups are asking the ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco to review and overturn the EPA’s approval of a Monsanto herbicide made with a chemical called dicamba., The allegations are from the National Family Farm Coalition, which represents tens of thousands of farmers across the US, and three non-profit consumer and environmental groups. They have been granted an expedited review of their legal petition and hope for a ruling that would block use of the herbicide this summer., The court hearing, which is to be handled by phone due to the coronavirus closing of California courthouses, comes just a month after the office of inspector general for the EPA said it would open an investigation into the agency’s handling of dicamba herbicides., Farmers have reported dicamba damage in both organic and conventional crops, including non-GMO soybeans, wheat, grapes, melons, vegetables and tobacco. A Missouri peach farmer won a $265m verdict in February against Monsanto and German chemical giant BASF after accusing the companies of creating a “defective” crop system that damaged 30,000 peach trees., The Guardian reported last month that internal Monsanto documents obtained through the peach farmer litigation revealed that Monsanto predicted its dicamba crop system would lead to thousands of damage claims from US farmers but pushed ahead anyway, trying to downplay the risks to the EPA., “You’ve had millions of acres impacted,” said George Kimbrell, a lawyer with the Center for Food Safety, which is one of the environmental groups seeking court review of the EPA, alongside the Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network., Kimbrell said: “They decided to make farmers part of an ongoing experiment. The dicamba problem is unprecedented.”, The crop system in question was developed by Monsanto with help from BASF to encourage farmers to buy dicamba herbicides and spray them over the top of new genetically engineered soybean and cotton crops developed by Monsanto to tolerate dicamba. The altered crops survive dicamba spray but weeds die, making it easier for farmers to eradicate weeds resistant to other herbicides such as Monsanto’s glyphosate., Before the introduction of Monsanto’s dicamba-tolerant cotton in 2015 and soybeans in 2016, farmers were largely restricted from using dicamba during the growing season because the chemical can easily drift and vaporize, traveling long distances from where it is sprayed. But the release of the new dicamba-tolerant crops upended that restraint and the EPA subsequently approved “new use” dicamba products sold by Monsanto, BASF and Corteva Agriscience for treating fields planted with the genetically engineered cotton and soybeans., The companies said their herbicides would have low volatility and if farmers followed instructions on the product labels, they could prevent drift. But since the introduction of the new dicamba-tolerant soybeans and cotton, drift and volatilization has killed or injured a variety of crops, fruit trees and other plants across several millions acres., The consumer and environmental groups claim the EPA violated federal law by failing to analyze the “significant socioeconomic and agronomic costs to farmers” and not relying on adequate data in its approvals of the herbicides. The damage over the last few summer seasons has been “catastrophic” they claim., The groups cite government documents they say show that the EPA itself has downplayed or ignored warnings from state agricultural officials and farmer pleas for protection from dicamba drift. Instead the agency has worked closely with Monsanto to keep the company’s dicamba herbicide, called XtendiMax, on the market, they say., Documents filed in court show Monsanto met multiple times with EPA officials about the concerns, even editing EPA language about certain steps Monsanto should take in communications with retailers. In an October 2017 email, an EPA official forwarded a Monsanto official comments from the agency regarding the company’s product label, writing: “Like I said, no surprises.”, While the EPA worked with Monsanto, the records show the agency was well aware of the extent of crop damage being reported to multiple states. In a June 2018 email an Arkansas bee keeper said dicamba had caused a 50% reduction in his honey production, and a July 2018 email from a Kansas Department of Agriculture supervisor told the EPA the department had been “overrun with dicamba complaints”., Monsanto, which was bought by Bayer AG in 2018, said the claims raised by the farm coalition and other petitioners are “baseless” and the company “stands fully behind” its product., “We believe the extensive body of science supporting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s registration decision will ultimately determine the outcome,” said Bayer spokesman Chris Loder. Monsanto has filed as an intervenor in the case., For its part, BASF said dicamba herbicides are “critically important tools for growers” and said the company is providing training to dicamba applicators and is working with academics and state and federal agencies to address concerns., Corteva declined to comment., Despite the outcry over dicamba damage, in November 2018 the EPA granted a two-year extension for the dicamba herbicides for use over the dicamba-tolerant cotton and soybeans. That registration expires on 20 December and the agency is currently considering whether or not to further extend approval., In the meantime, the EPA said it was working with states and with the companies selling the dicamba herbicides to “better understand the issue” to enable it to deal with “the problem of illegal drift”., The EPA also insists that it is not certain what is causing the crop damage., “The underlying causes of the various damage incidents are not yet clear, as ongoing investigations have yet to be concluded,” the agency told the Guardian., Carey Gillam tweets at @careygillamepa faces court over backing of monsantos controversial crop system", "label": 0}, "train-705": {"text": "\nCountry diary: a nature mooch undulls the children’s senses\n, Hungerford, West Berkshire: I’d wanted to show them slow-worms but we ran out of time.

We undull our senses. Outside the closed-off science block, we make “deer’s ears”, cupping our hands behind our ears and directing them at the noisy rookery-nursery. There are gasps at the enhanced volume., We wander to the edges of the playing field, bordering farmland, and hear a skylark singing at what would be the height of the 100m sprint track, were it placed upright. We find muntjac slots – tiny, paired deer hoofprints – a badger-boundary latrine and consider the phrase “ecological niche” when a kite tussles midair with a buzzard. There is a brief, talon-grappling fall through the air, before the birds are back in their own territorial airspace., I had wanted to show them slow-worms, Anguis fragilis. I know where they are, but we run out of time., I am assailed by a memory, walking my middle child to her last day at primary school. A slow-worm crossed our path and she picked it up. It wrapped its strong, burnished-copper body round her thin wrist like a protective amulet. We admired its faint, Mona Lisa smile, watched it blink and found its ears – pencilled brackets around its head; things that mark it out as a lizard, not a snake., More recently, revising Macbeth for a GCSE she will never sit, my daughter and I realised that the witches’ ingredient of a “blind worm’s sting” was the shed end of the slow-worm’s autotomised tail. It prompted the same memory in her, of her last day at primary school, and produced fresh tears at the denial of her last day at secondary school., The students and I exchange pledges to stay safe. On the way home, there is a slow-worm on the dusty, deserted road: a school ruler’s length of rope, which I might have missed had I not half expected to see one. I stop and pick it up. It coils its cool, tubular body around my wrist, just as one did my daughter’s all those years ago., With a greyer, polished, blue-flecked body, this one is a male.

The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a curious creature with a complex lifestyle that is still barely understood., Eels are thought to begin life as eggs in the Sargasso Sea; drifting as larvae for about a year 4,000 miles north-east in the Gulf Stream before turning into tiny transparent eels. Their goal is to find a home in rivers, lakes and ponds while growing darker and larger for up to 10 years. When nearly a metre long they set off back across the Atlantic to breed., Eels were once common but the species is now critically endangered. This is partly because many rivers have been blocked with weirs and dams and others polluted. Another only recently discovered reason is that tinned and processed foods made with eels, analysed in Hong Kong and thought to be equally scarce Asian eels, turned out to be the European variety. The glass eels had been caught illegally   in Europe and shipped to Asia to be grown in eel farms.

A further six authorities have stopped collecting glass or cardboard., Cardiff city council said it was continuing to collect recycled material as usual and was asking residents to rinse out their recycling and sort items in the correct bags even though the materials would be incinerated for the near future., “Strange as it seems, we still need you to put recyclables into your green recycling bags so that we can return to recycling the waste when we are able,” the council said in a statement., The coronavirus lockdown has generated a massive increase in domestic waste collection UK-wide, with nearly a third of authorities reporting an increase of between 20% and 50% on normal volumes of waste collected through household bins. Nearly one in 10 reported waste increases of up to twice as much as usual., The pressure on local waste disposal services has been underlined by data showing that huge areas of the country have suspended bulky waste collection (55% of councils), garden waste disposal (29%), and food waste (10%) to cope with the crisis., A survey of 250 UK councils carried out by the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (Adept) found that a quarter of local waste teams reported losing up to 40% of staff through illness or self-isolation last week., The charity Keep Britain Tidy has warned that some councils are struggling to keep on top of fly-tipping, suggesting that it might be linked to an increase in DIY and decluttering as people stay at home, as well as the widespread closure of household recycling centres under physical distancing rules., However, all councils have maintained normal or near-normal levels of domestic refuse collection, and just 2% have suspended recycling. Fears that reductions in recycling collection would lead to a shortage of cardboard packaging have receded, with about 10 councils restarting suspended recycling services., Ian Fielding, chair of Adept’s Waste Group, said: “It is encouraging to see that local authorities are maintaining core waste services with minimal disruption and that councils are able to put resources into tackling fly-tipping.”, Just 32% of councils are operating normal levels of street sweeping, the Adept survey showed, although the majority were experiencing only moderate or minor disruption. About 7% reported “severe disruption” to street cleaning services., Richard McIlwain, deputy chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy, said: “As organisations providing key frontline services, local authorities are having to prioritise core services, including the regular collection of our household waste., “However, we are aware that some local authorities are reporting an increase in fly-tipping, potentially linked to the temporary closure of recycling centres. Fly-tipping is a serious environmental crime that blights local communities and harms wildlife, and local authorities should not be having to deal with increased illegal dumping., “At a time of national crisis, we all have a personal role to play in keeping our environment safe. If you have rubbish you can’t put in your normal bin, either store it until the recycling centres are open or pay for a waste company to take it away, checking first that they are correctly licensed as a waste carrier with the Environment Agency and always ask for a receipt.”, An Inverclyde council spokesperson said: “The reintroduction of recycling collections remains an urgent priority.

The scientists behind the study said more research was needed to confirm a causal link and rule out other possible factors such as income levels and any difference in age profiles in the regions., But they said there was an urgent need to share information about the pandemic. Previous research showed air pollution increased deaths during the Sars outbreak in 2003, and long-term exposure to dirty air is well known to damage lung health., “Our study adds to growing evidence from northern Italy and the US that high levels of air pollution are linked to deadlier cases of Covid-19,” said Miguel Martins, of the University of Cambridge, who led the new analysis., “This is something we saw during the Sars outbreak back in 2003, where long-term exposure to air pollutants had a detrimental effect on the prognosis of patients in China. This highlights the importance of reducing air pollution for the protection of human health, both in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.”, Research published on Monday found that the five most polluted regions among 66 analysed in Italy, Spain, France and Germany accounted for 78% of all Covid-19 deaths in the 66 regions. Another recent study looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates., Experts say the idea that air pollution may increase susceptibility to Covid-19 is plausible, but they warn that early studies must be treated very carefully., “As epidemiologists we are very cautious about interpreting studies, as we have learned even in high-quality studies about hidden biases and simple random variability,” said Prof Mark Goldberg, of McGill University in Canada. “When we try to assess causality, especially in non-randomised studies, we need about 20-30 really good studies.”, People over the age of 60 or with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease are thought to be at the highest risk of severe symptoms or death from Covid-19., In the new study, the scientists write: “Long-term exposure to air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides from car exhaust fumes or burning fossil fuels, is a known risk factor for these health conditions.”, The analysis showed a correlation between air pollution levels recorded in 2018 and 2019 and data on deaths reported in England up to 8 April. “Future and more detailed studies may further elucidate these observations by addressing potential confounders, including socioeconomic status, comorbidities, age, race and differences between regional health regulations and their intensive care unit capacities,” the scientists said., The study also notes that the severity of another lung infection, called respiratory syncytial virus, is known to be directly linked to variations in nitrogen oxide levels., Prof Jonathan Grigg, of Queen Mary University of London, said it was important to note that the study was not peer-reviewed. “But these provisional results are compatible with recently published studies and confirm what we already know – that air pollution has many adverse effects on human health. We must therefore now plan to prevent a bounceback in traffic emissions after the lockdown has ended.”, Widespread lockdowns around the world have led to reduced vehicle traffic and air pollution. However, long-term exposure to dirty air before the pandemic may be more important than current levels of pollution.preliminary study links air pollution to coronavirus deaths in england", "label": 0}, "train-710": {"text": "\nWill Florida be lost forever to the climate crisis?\n, \nWill Florida be lost forever to the climate crisis?\n, From sea level rise to habitat loss, the effects of the climate crisis are on the verge of making south Florida uninhabitable, \nRichard Luscombe in Miami, \n\nTue 21 Apr 2020 06.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Apr 2020 14.29 EDT\n\n, Few places on the planet are more at risk from the climate crisis than south Florida, where more than 8 million residents are affected by the convergence of almost every modern environmental challenge – from rising seas to contaminated drinking water, more frequent and powerful hurricanes, coastal erosion, flooding and vanishing wildlife and habitat., If scientists are right, the lower third of the state will be underwater by the end of the century. Yet despite this grim outlook, scientists, politicians, environment groups and others are tackling the challenges head on., Below are some of the biggest threats posed by the climate crisis to south Florida today, along with solutions under consideration. Some of these solutions will have a lasting impact on the fight. Others, in many cases, are only delaying the inevitable. But in every situation, doing something is preferable to doing nothing at all., The threat: By any estimation, Florida is drowning. In some scenarios, sea levels will rise up to 31in  by 2060, a devastating prediction for a region that already deals regularly with tidal flooding and where an estimated 120,000 properties on or near the water are at risk. The pace of the rise is also hastening, scientists say – it took 31 years for the waters around Miami to rise by six inches, while the next six inches will take only 15 more. At such a rate, many of Miami Beach’s landmarks, the world famous South Beach, and the picturesque art deco hotels of Ocean Drive, will be lost within three decades, according to some studies., Possible solutions: Dozens of municipalities, the four counties of south-east Florida, and partner groups such as the Nature Conservancy have combined their efforts through the south-east regional action climate plan to tackle the crisis. In Miami Beach, dubbed the “ground zero” of sea rise, a multifaceted and costly Rising Above program is already under way. It includes elevating roads, building new sea walls and installing new and higher capacity pumps and drainage systems to alleviate flooding. In the Florida Keys, the approach will probably tilt more towards managed retreat: abandoning areas too expensive to maintain and focusing on measures with a better cost-benefit ratio. Parts of the Keys are going to simply disappear, some within two decades., The cost: The participating counties and municipalities are contributing to a $4bn statewide spend, including Miami Beach’s $400m Forever Bond, a $1bn stormwater plan and $250m of improvements to Broward county’s sewage systems to protect against flooding and seawater seepage. In the Keys, many consider the estimated $60m a mile cost of raising roads too expensive., The threat: Saltwater from sea level rise is seeping further inland through Florida’s porous limestone bedrock and contaminating underground freshwater supplies, notably in the Biscayne aquifer, the 4,000-sq mile shallow limestone basin that provides drinking water to millions in southern Florida. Years of over-pumping and toxic runoff from farming and the sugar industry in central Florida and the Everglades have worsened the situation. The Florida department of environmental protection warned in March that “existing sources of water will not adequately meet the reasonable beneficial needs for the next 20 years”. A rising water table, meanwhile, has exacerbated problems with south Florida’s ageing sewage systems. Since December, millions of gallons of toxic, raw sewage have spilled on to Fort Lauderdale’s streets from a series of pipe failures., Possible solutions: A comprehensive 30-year Everglades restoration plan was authorized by Congress in 2000 to “restore, preserve and protect” the south Florida ecosystem by improving water flows to help flush the salinity, and a 78bn-gallon Everglades agricultural area reservoir (EAA), a key component of the congressional plan, is earmarked for land once leased by big sugar. The restoration plan, however, has stalled amid funding wrangles, and the storage reservoir plan delayed several times., The cost: The Everglades restoration plan was originally priced at $7.8bn, rose to $10.5bn, and has since ballooned to $16.4bn. Donald Trump’s proposed 2021 federal budget includes $250m for Everglades restoration. The estimated $1.8bn cost of the reservoir will be split between federal and state budgets., The threat: In October 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as the first category 5 cyclone to strike the US since 1992. In the devastating hurricane season just one year before, major storms named Harvey, Maria and Irma combined to cause damage estimated at $265bn. Scientists have evidence the climate crisis is causing cyclones to be more powerful, and intensify more quickly, and Florida’s position at the end of the Atlantic Ocean’s “hurricane alley” makes it twice as vulnerable as any other state., Possible solutions: Previous efforts to tame hurricanes were a failure, and experts see mitigation strategies, including more robust building codes, as the best defense. Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which destroyed more than 63,000 houses, led to the implementation of a statewide construction code that is updated every three years, though there are regional variations, and criticisms that industry lobbyists have too much sway., The cost: With homeowners and businesses largely bearing their own costs, the specific amount spent on “hurricane-proofing” in Florida is impossible to know. A 2018 Pew research study documented $1.3bn in hazard mitigation grants from federal and state funding in 2017, along with a further $8bn in post-disaster grants. Florida is spending another $633m from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development on resiliency planning., The threat: Florida’s native flora and fauna are being devastated by climate change, with the Florida Natural Areas Inventory warning that a quarter of the 1,200 species it tracks is set to lose more than half their existing habitat, and the state’s beloved manatees and Key deer are at risk of extinction. Warmer and more acidic seas reduce other species’ food stocks and exacerbate the deadly red-tide algal blooms that have killed incalculable numbers of fish, turtles, dolphins and other marine life. Bleaching and stony coral tissue disease linked to the climate crisis threaten to hasten the demise of the Great Florida Reef, the only living coral reef in the continental US. Encroaching saltwater has turned Big Pine Key, a crucial deer habitat, into a ghost forest., Possible solutions: The diverse range of challenges requires a piecemeal approach. A state and federally funded “Noah’s ark” is collecting and preserving coral chunks at venues including Nova Southeastern University as disease research continues. A new state taskforce of marine scientists and biologists is tackling the blue-green algae outbreaks that have choked Florida’s inland waterways. As for the Key deer, of which fewer than 1,000 remain, volunteers leave clean drinking water to replace salt-contaminated watering holes as herds retreat to higher ground. A longer-term debate is under way on the merits and ethics of relocating the species to other areas of Florida or the US., The cost: Florida is spending $4m in the current financial year for expanded water quality analytics related to “nutrient over-enrichment” and $3m annually for the next five years on Red Tide research. A 20-year project backed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to restore 3m sq feet of the Great Florida Reef is estimated at $100m. Such projects can only scratch the surface of the incalculable investment that will be needed to save the states species and their habitats., The threat: Tourist brochures showcase miles of golden, sandy beaches in South Florida, but the reality is somewhat different. The Florida department of environmental protection deems the entire coastline from Miami to Cape Canaveral “critically eroded”, the result of sea level rise, historically high tides and especially storm surges from a succession of powerful hurricanes. In south-eastern Florida’s Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, authorities are waging a continuous war on sand loss, eager to maintain their picture-perfect image and protect two of their biggest sources of income, tourism dollars and lucrative property taxes from waterfront homes and businesses., Possible solutions: With the other option abandoning beaches to the elements, city and county commissions have little choice but costly replenishment projects with sand replacement and jetty construction. Federal law prohibits the importation of cheaper foreign sand, so the municipalities must source a more expensive alternative from US markets, often creating friction with residents who don’t want to part with their sand. Supplementary to sand replenishment, the Nature Conservancy is a partner in a number of nature-based coastal defense projects from West Palm Beach to Miami., The cost: Authorities usually match federal funding for replenishment projects. An $8m project restored almost 125,000 cubic yards to three Broward county beaches last winter, and $55m will be spent on a 400,000-sq yd restoration on three others beginning in the fall. The region’s showpiece, Miami Beach, benefited from 61,000 cubic yards of new sand this year at a cost of $16m. Statewide, Florida spends an average $50m annually on beach erosion., The threat: “Climate gentrification” is a buzzword around south Florida, a region barely 6ft above sea level where land has become increasingly valuable in elevated areas. Speculators and developers are eyeing historically black, working-class and poorer areas, pushing out long-term residents and replacing affordable housing with upscale developments and luxury accommodations that only the wealthy can afford. In Miami, the controversial Magic City Innovation District in the neighborhood of Little Haiti is a billion-dollar, 17-acre, towering behemoth blending commercial, residential, entertainment and hotel space. It has drawn legal action from locals who say their rights have been trampled., Possible solutions: Experts argue there are ways to lessen the impact of climate gentrification on local populations without the need for displacement, such as providing affordable working space and housing for existing residents, and using sustainable construction practices and environmentally friendly materials. Magic City’s developers insist they are committed to the neighborhood, including below-market-cost housing. Local authorities and activist groups are working to “protect” areas by investing in revitalization and affordable housing projects., The cost: No study has yet calculated the overall cost of affordable housing lost to the climate crisis. Private developers will bear the expense of mitigating the impact on the neighborhood – $31m in Magic City’s case over 15 years to the Little Haiti Revitalization Trust, largely for new “green” affordable housing. The University of Miami’s housing solutions lab has a $300,000 grant from JPMorgan to report on the impact of rising seas to South Florida’s affordable housing stocks and recommend modifications to prevent it from flooding and other climate events. A collaboration of not-for-profit groups is chasing $75m in corporate funding for affordable housing along the 70-mile south Florida rail trail from Miami to West Palm Beach, with the first stage, a $5m project under way to identify, build and renovate 300 units., The threat: Florida has long been plagued by political leadership more in thrall to the interests of big industry than the environment. As governor from 2011 to 2019, Rick Scott, now a US senator, slashed $700m from Florida’s water management budget, rolled back environmental regulations and enforcement, gave a free ride to polluters, and flip-flopped over expanding offshore oil drilling. The politician who came to be known as “Red Tide Rick”, for his perceived inaction over 2018’s toxic algae bloom outbreaks, reportedly banned the words “climate change” and “global warming” from state documents., Possible solutions: It’s too soon for deep deliberations on Scott’s successor, fellow Republican Ron DeSantis, but in little more than a year in office he has made several moves that surprised environmentalists. He appointed Florida’s first chief science officer, created an algae taskforce, struck a deal to prevent drilling in parts of the Everglades, and won a tussle with Florida’s legislature to expand an ambitious land acquisition and preservation program. Last month, state legislators approved the first dedicated climate bill. It appears a promising start for a new administration, but activists say more needs to be done. In January, the Sierra Club awarded DeSantis failing grades in an environmental report card, saying he failed to protect Florida’s springs and rivers and approved new roads that threatened protected wildlife., The cost: Florida’s spending on the environment is increasing. The state budget passed last month included $650m for Everglades restoration and water management projects (an instalment of DeSantis’s $2.5bn four-year pledge) and $100m for Florida Forever. A $100m bridge project jointly funded by the state and federal governments will allow the free flow of water under the Tamiami Trail for the first time in decades., Florida has woken up to the threat of climate change but it is not yet clear how effective the response will be. The challenges are innumerable, the costs immense and the political will to fix or minimize the issues remains questionable, despite recent progress., At stake is the very future of one of the largest and most diverse states in the nation, in terms of both its population and its environment. Action taken now will determine its survival., This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

But at least we can do something about that, \nMark Cocker, \n\nTue 21 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, Much as I love toad breeding season for the way it brings thousands to Lightwood’s ponds, it’s actually a dangerous time for them. For seven evenings a friend’s daily exercise involved patrolling a stretch of river with a bucket to retrieve trapped toads. This year we estimate that he, with minor contributions from others, including me, has saved 1,100., The problem is that toads arriving from the north and west are channelled, before they reach the spawning ground, into a stone-lined culvert that contains the flow of Hogshaw Brook. They are then blocked by a two-metre wall and are doomed, unless they can find a way over. One route for 30 of them was in the pockets of my smock, after which I released them on the lip of the water – a moment that felt wonderful for the old toad in my soul., Unfortunately, there are other hazards. In normal circumstances, a female acquires her mate en route to the pond or in the water. (Apparently it’s the quality of his voice that determines her choice.) They couple and the female spawns. But a small number, possibly the largest females, are subjected to a frenzy of attention from mateless males. They can become completely enfolded in would-be suitors and loll helplessly, the males with faces squashed on some part of her as if to smother her in adoration; in these stressed circumstances, she can drown., I observed one aggregation where the female surfaced intermittently as the whole body-ball slowly, randomly, revolved in the water. Occasionally she would roll on her back, her pale belly globed at the surface, her powerful arms and legs spread, when there was about her an aura of extraordinary forbearance but little pleasure., This passivity is not always maintained. I saw a neighbouring toad ball in which the female twisted and roiled in the middle of her male pack. They fell away and she issued a final sequence of powerful strokes with her legs to batter any last suitors. Eventually she was free, except for one male, and she swam away with enormous vigour like some immense beast with a small child on its back.country diary frustrated toads could do with a helping hand", "label": 0}, "train-713": {"text": "\nWeatherwatch: what is the dew point?\n, The dew point is the temperature at which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapour and for dew to form, Daniel Gardner, \n\nWed 22 Apr 2020 16.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 22 Apr 2020 23.11 EDT\n\n, The dew point is the temperature at which a certain area of air must be cooled to for dew to form. It is also commonly interpreted as a measure of the air’s moisture content. As air cools, the amount of the gaseous form of water it is capable of holding decreases, and as such, cooling will eventually result in it reaching saturation point, beyond which condensation into liquid water droplets occurs. This is the main process behind cloud formation in the atmosphere., Of course, dew can also form on surfaces on earth. When the surface (for example grass or cars) cools below the dew point temperature of the air adjacent, condensation droplets from the air deposit onto that surface. If surface temperatures fall below 0C and below the dew point temperature, instead of water vapour gas condensing to water droplets, it transitions directly to crystals of ice, in the form of frost., While frost formation in winter months is rather common, surface temperatures in autumn or in spring are less likely to fall down to the air’s dew point, aided by the shorter overnight cooling periods. Hence, dew and frost do not form as readily, especially on objects which can have larger stores of heat in them, such as roads.weatherwatch what is the dew point", "label": 0}, "train-714": {"text": "\nEarth Day goes digital to engage online gamers with environment issues\n, Event’s 50th anniversary sees digital activism replace demos, due to coronavirus, \nSandra Laville, \n\nWed 22 Apr 2020 14.43 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 23 Apr 2020 10.37 EDT\n\n, Earth Day demonstrations scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic are being replaced with digital activism via the online gaming community to exploit an as yet untapped audience for action against climate change., Earth Day, 22 April 2020, had been years in the planning but the large global demonstrations to mark the event’s 50th anniversary were brought to a halt by Covid-19. In a swift pivot from the physical action which was to have been spearheaded by half a million people gathering in Washington DC, organisers sent their movement into the digital sphere., In an attempt to capture huge audiences they have collaborated with the online gaming community, sending messages about the need to tackle climate change., This week, the two million people who play the digital card game Solitaire Grand Harvest were greeted with climate messages and additional games designed to spur players into thinking about ways they could help the environment. The game already has a “green” tinge: players grow virtual plants and harvest crops on a “farm” in its challenges., Jillian Semaan, food and environment director at the Earth Day network, said: “We had to completely change what we were doing to mark the day, and this seemed like a natural fit with Solitaire Grand Harvest and something we were really excited about., “This is the first time we have reached out through the gaming world. Measuring success is always challenging, but what we hope is that these additional games will allow people to see that what we produce, what we consume and what we waste has an impact., “If this translates, once the lockdowns are over, into people going out and engaging more with the environment, in beach cleans, reducing waste, that is the connection we want to make.”, Players of Solitaire Grand Harvest this week are greeted with the introduction: “As y’all know, our farm is full of different landscapes, just like the planet we live on. So, in honor of the International Earth Day we’ve decided to pay homage to mother nature with some special challenges, unique surprises, and HUGE rewards – all related to environmental protection and recycling.”, Yuval Dor, owner of Solitaire Grand Harvest, said: “I think games are a fantastic way to deliver serious messages but in a fun way, without the feeling that you are been lectured., “In a time like this when gathering is not allowed, and many of the physical activities that usually take place are impossible, digital spaces are more relevant than ever to convince people to take action ... completing virtual missions like cleaning beaches, replanting forests and recycling competition will engage our players in a fun way, to the importance of giving back to the planet and take action, even remotely. “earth day bypasses virus with journey into gaming world", "label": 0}, "train-715": {"text": "\nConservation plans help boost threatened mammals, scientists find\n, While some species have declined by more than a third overall, where conservation measures are in place they have increased by 46%, \nLisa Cox, \n\nWed 22 Apr 2020 13.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 22 Apr 2020 13.31 EDT\n\n, Populations of some Australian mammals declined by more than a third over two decades, but sites with clear conservation management saw improvements in their populations of 46%, according to new research., The figures are the first tranche of data in Australia’s Threatened Species Index for mammals, which combines data from monitoring programs across the country to track trends in threatened species populations., A similar database already exists for birds and is collated by researchers working with the Threatened Species Recovery Hub in collaboration with state agencies and NGOs., The first tranche collates data for 57 threatened and near-threatened mammal species, including the northern quoll and the yellow-footed rock wallaby. It covers the years 1995-2016 across 1,186 different locations., Populations of the mammals at these sites declined on average by 38%, , but the researchers found a source for optimism at locations where conservation measures had been put in place. At sites with clear conservation management efforts, populations increased on average by 46%. Only 155 of the 1,186 locations had active conservation work in place., At 15 feral cat and fox-free sites, the populations of threatened and near-threatened mammals had increased five-fold., Elisa Bayraktarov, a researcher at the University of Queensland and the co-leader of the index, said the data showed investment in conservation “pays off”., “It does tell us we should drive more investment, especially in those mammals that are doing so badly elsewhere,” she said., The research found where there was no active conservation work, populations had declined on average by 60%., John Woinarski, a conservation biologist who is part of the research team, said animals in predator-free havens fared well, with the burrowing bettong and bridled nail-tailed wallaby among species to show large improvements in these areas., “However, havens cover only 0.1% of Australia’s total area, so they are only one part of the solution to Australia’s long-term biodiversity loss, and they are not a solution for species that are declining for reasons other than cats and foxes,” he said., The data will be gradually updated to cover more mammals and more locations. At present, the index includes very little monitoring data for New South Wales and the ACT, but updates are expected in the next tranche due in November., Bayraktarov said the index in its current form was probably “underestimating the decline in Australia”., The research team is looking for contributions to future iterations of the index from any scientists and groups collecting standardised monitoring data., The national environment laws set up to protect threatened species are currently under independent review. The statutory review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act occurs once every 10 years and is due to publish its final report in October., Environment groups have long called for an overhaul of the act, which has been failing to stem Australia’s rate of extinction., Last week, six organisations asked for the review’s timeframes to be extended because of the disruption caused by the back-to-back bushfire and coronavirus crises.conservation plans help boost threatened mammals scientists find", "label": 0}, "train-716": {"text": "\nEarth Day: Greta Thunberg calls for 'new path' after pandemic\n, Climate activist says Covid-19 outbreak shows change can happen when we listen to scientists, \nJonathan Watts, \n\nWed 22 Apr 2020 13.15 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 22 Apr 2020 15.35 EDT\n\n, Greta Thunberg has urged people around the world to take a new path after the coronavirus pandemic, which she said proved “our society is not sustainable”., The Swedish climate activist said the strong global response to Covid-19 demonstrated how quickly change could happen when humanity came together and acted on the advice of scientists., She said the same principles should be applied to the climate crisis., “Whether we like it or not, the world has changed. It looks completely different now from how it did a few months ago. It may never look the same again. We have to choose a new way forward,” she told a YouTube audience in a virtual meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day., “If the coronavirus crisis has shown us one thing, it is that our society is not sustainable. If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account.”, The teenage campaigner, who initiated the global school strike movement, was filmed at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm in digital conversation with Johan Rockström, the earth systems scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute., He said there was a strong correlation between the pandemic and the environmental crisis: deforestation and the wildlife trade heighten the likelihood of viruses leaping the species boundary; air pollution increases human vulnerability by weakening respiratory systems; and the expansion of air travel allows epidemics to spread more quickly. “The scientific evidence shows they are interconnected and part of the same planetary crisis,” he said. “We are living beyond the carrying capacity of the planet so we are putting human health and the health of nature at risk.”, The lockdown has reduced emissions and hurt the oil industry, which is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet to dangerous levels. But the two speakers stressed the virus should not be seen as an environmental panacea because it has brought immense human suffering, provided only temporary respite and distracted from campaigns, research and international meetings that aimed to find a smoother transition to a clean economy., The key lesson from the pandemic, they said, was the need for governments to pay more heed to scientific warnings., “We have underestimated the shocks. We need to build more shock absorbers into the system,” Rockström said. “Around the world, people are recognising the uncertainty and are being cautious. Also regarding the climate, we cannot know for certain how far we can push up global warming. So I hope that we come out of the pandemic with the recognition that science shows: it’s not worth taking the risk ... I believe that something new is coming from the ashes of the corona crisis. We’ll rise out of this, but not by bouncing back to the old world.”, He said there was more support now for green new deals in Europe and South Korea and for China to go beyond the economy when setting priorities., Neither speaker mentioned the US president, Donald Trump, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, or other leaders who have either dismissed the risk of the pandemic or used it to relax environmental protections and health standards in the name of economic recovery. But Thunberg alluded to these dangers., “During a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn’t happen,” she said. “I cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn’t slide in the wrong direction.”, Elsewhere, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war, though he said the environmental emergency was deeper., He said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean, green jobs; taxpayer support for sustainable growth; an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature; investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system, and international cooperation., A new opinion poll suggests there is strong support for this view. Sixty-six per cent of Britons believe the climate is as serious a long-term crisis as Covid-19 and 58% agree it should be prioritised in the economic recovery. The survey of 14 countries by Mori found even higher levels of support in China, Germany, France, India, Italy and Japan. Even in the least enthusiastic nations – the US and Australia – a majority supported green priorities in stimulus programmes. , Public opinion has shifted dramatically in the past two years as a result of increasingly grim climate studies and high-profile campaigns by groups such as FridaysForFuture and Extinction Rebellion. Big strikes and marches have been postponed but Thunberg vowed they will be back once it is safe to return to the streets., “We have to adapt. That is what you have to do in a crisis,” she said. “People are thinking we will get out of this and then we will push even harder.”earth day greta thunberg calls for new path after pandemic", "label": 0}, "train-717": {"text": "\nThe first Earth Day - archive, April 1970\n, Fifty years ago, millions of Americans participated in the first Earth Day, an event held to increase public awareness of the world’s environmental problems , \nAlistair Cooke, \n\nWed 22 Apr 2020 06.50 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 22 Apr 2020 06.51 EDT\n\n, 24 April 1970, New York, April 23In every big and little city of America yesterday, vast throngs of people, the young, the old, the brash, the solemn, and the bland packed the avenues and malls and main streets in a celebration, half gay, half ghoulish, of Earth Day, the first mass reminder of our decaying and polluted planet., From the crow’s nest of a skyscraper or the window of a helicopter, the crowds looked very like the populations that trooped silently to their doom in the film version of On the Beach. But close up they were uniformly gay and relaxed, ambling around the traffic-free roadways as if some blessed Newton or Paul Ehrlich had produced a miraculous cure for the chlorinated hydrocarbons that threaten to poison the earth and the oceans in the next decade. It was a day of warning but it was carried off like a day of thanksgiving. Nowhere was there any reported violence., Nothing like it in war or peace has been seen in this country. Victory parades, Fourth of July marches. and VE night orgies have been more feverish, but as visible expressions of mass sentiment they paled beside the continental scale of this demonstration., Senator Muskie of Maine, a veteran Savonarola of environmental blight addressed a crowd of 25,000 in Philadelphia. A hundred thousand pilgrims passed through Union Square here, and countless thousands jammed the mile-long stretch of Fifth Avenue from 42nd Street to Central Park., In the New Mexico desert students signed a plastic globe and marched into Albuquerque to present it to state Senators accused of opposing a strong anti-pollution law. In San Francisco, a small group broke away from the great crowd to dump oil into a reflecting pool outside the office building of Standard Oil Company of California. In Washington, Congress was recessed to allow its members to scatter to the mountains, the prairies and the coast, to march or speechify., Hubert Humphrey was appealing, before a Minnesota high school audience, for a United Nations global agency “to monitor and enforce pollution abatement throughout the world.”, In a dozen or more States, Legislatures were passing anti-pollution bills and governors were flourishing pens to sign them. In every city and small town, there appeared a rash of gasmasks, bandages, surgical masks, model skeletons. In Montreal, a fashion show displayed the compulsory women’s wear for 1984: jump suits, vinyl gloves, and plastic face masks., Quite possibly half the schools of the nation were closed or given over for a day to expositions and preachments about the threat to the human environment. From Miami to the Pacific North-west and from Augusta, Maine, to Southern California, children were piping grisly parodies of popular songs. A tot in Indiana sang “Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. Jack came down with hepatitis and Jill came down two weeks after.” The number one hit song was amended to celebrate “Oil drops falling on my shoulder.”, In thousands of parks and along main streets, armies of young people went collecting strewn paper, bottles, and other trash. This was a goodly sight to see, the only one in many cities that showed people doing something about the blight that millions were out to deplore., There was one tiny town that heard too late about Earth Day.

(February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let’s think outside the pandemic bubble.), Simpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel described a permanently yellow horizon: “I not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.” Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: “The person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller’s are black as coal.” You’ve probably heard of Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River catching fire, but here’s how the former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller described the Hudson south of Albany: “One great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” Everything that people say about the air and water in China and India right now was said of America’s cities then., It’s no wonder that people mobilized: 20 million Americans took to the streets for the first Earth Day in 1970 – 10% of America’s population at the time, perhaps the single greatest day of political protest in the country’s history. And it worked. Worked politically because Congress quickly passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and scientifically because those laws had the desired effect. In essence, they stuck enough filters on smokestacks, car exhausts and factory effluent pipes that, before long, the air and water were unmistakably cleaner. The nascent Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a series of photos that showed just how filthy things were. Even for those of us who were alive then, it’s hard to imagine that we tolerated this., But we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we’re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can’t see them., The carbon dioxide molecule is invisible; at today’s levels you can’t see it or smell it, and it doesn’t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That’s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don’t quite see it., And it’s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It’s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It’s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There’s no catalytic converter for CO2, which means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry., That in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and may even own them, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital., And so we are. Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase – the planet’s largest by market capitalization – which has funneled a quarter-trillion dollars to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like Liberty Mutual, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL during a pandemic., This campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock announced that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to edge away from coal. And Chase – well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the protest in January that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off; there’s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing., Still, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it’s clear that these companies have no future. The divestment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam., Our job – a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago – is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as Donald Trump does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That’s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets last September. That’s not 20 million, but it’s on the way., We can’t be on the streets right now. So we’ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet.

Most of these are reported from the west of Germany., The blue tit is found across Europe and is one of the most common visitors to UK gardens. They eat insects, caterpillars, seeds and nuts and can be spotted all year round in the UK, with the exception of some Scottish islands.According to NABU, symptoms of the diseased birds include breathing problems, no longer taking food and making no attempt to escape when approached by people. The group is advising people to stop feeding or providing drinking troughs for birds to reduce the risk of transmission between them. The first laboratory test results on the dead birds have found a bacterial infection (Suttonella ornithocola) that has been known in the UK since the 1990s and which affects birds similarly. The infection was reported in Germany in 2018. Further test results on birds are expected over the next few days.The infection discovered causes pneumonia in tits – predominantly blue tits – and they become lethargic with fluffed-up plumage and breathing difficulties. There are no reports of this affecting any other animals apart from birds., Dr Becki Lawson, a disease specialist at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), said she had not yet seen any recent increase in mortality in blue tits or any other garden bird species in the UK. “We are aware of the recent reports of blue tit mortality from Germany and understand investigations are under way to determine the cause,” Lawson said. “Once a diagnosis is reached, we will be able to comment on whether the condition affecting blue tit populations in Germany is one that we also see in Great Britain.” A spokesperson for the RSPB said the risk to UK bird populations was currently extremely low. “This disease predominantly affects blue tits which are largely sedentary birds and do not move far from where they fledged.

The oil industry, a key driver of the climate crisis and direct environmental disaster, is in turmoil, with a barrel of crude hitting an unprecedented minus-$40 on Monday., These would perhaps be the sort of outcomes seen had stringent environmental policies been put in place in the wake of the first Earth Day in 1970, which saw 20 million Americans rally in support of anti-pollution measures., Instead, the pain of the Covid-19 shutdown has highlighted how ponderous the world’s response has been – the expected cut in emissions, for example, is still less than what scientists say is needed every year this decade to avoid disastrous climate impacts for much of the world., “It’s the worst possible way to experience environment improvement and it has also shown us the size of the task,” said Michael Gerrard, an environmental law expert at Columbia University., How people react to the return of normalcy after the pandemic will help define the crises racking the environment, according to Gerrard. “A key question will be do we have a green recovery, do we seize the opportunity to create jobs in renewable energy and in making coastlines more resilient to climate change?” he said. “The current US president clearly has no inclination to do this.”, McCarthy, now head of the Natural Resources Defense Council, noted that some Indian people were seeing the Himalayas for the first time due to the veil of air pollution lifting., “You wonder if people will want to go back to what it was like before,” she said. “The pandemic has shown people will change their behavior if it’s for the health of their families. This has been the lost message on climate, that it’s a human problem, not a planetary problem. We have to show you can have a stable environment and your job, too.”, The problems in the natural world haven’t suddenly vanished – this week various researchers found that the Arctic is very likely to be free of sea ice in summers before 2050, that the bushfires that torched Australia earlier this year released more carbon than the country’s annual CO2 output and that the first quarter of 2020 was the second-warmest on record., Donald Trump has signaled that he will try to provide a bailout to the US oil and gas industry, with $25bn already handed out by the US government to prop up airlines. In China, it’s not certain that the wildlife-packed “wet markets” where Covid-19 is believed to have originated will be shut down., Conservationists warn that returning the world to its pre-pandemic settings will quickly wipe out any environmental benefits of the shutdown., “It’s a serious wake-up call,” said Thomas Lovejoy, an ecologist who coined the term “biological diversity”. “We bulldoze into the last remaining places in nature and then are surprised when something like this happens. We have done this to ourselves by our continual intrusion into nature. We have to re-chart our course.”, This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

It’s very different now.”, The coronavirus pandemic has put a stop to large gatherings of people the world over, and the climate strikers have had to change their tactics. Now, instead of big crowds they hold mass video calls, and instead of marching with banners and placards they post photos with hashtags., “We’ve started digital striking because we want to keep the momentum going, so that when the pandemic is contained we still have that energy and we can go back on to the streets,” says Palmer., Every Friday, the strikers post photos of themselves holding a sign with a message about the climate crisis along with #DigitalStrike or #ClimateStrikeOnline, and they congregate in large Zoom calls, often with more than 100 people., “It’s the greatest call but also the most chaotic call you could ever imagine,” says Rikke Nielsen, 19, from Denmark. “Sometimes people bring animals; one time someone was playing the saxophone.”, The calls are giving the strikers a unique opportunity to connect with people they would not normally get the chance to meet. “I think we will start to see more of an international perspective in every country because of this,” says Nielsen., The digital strikes are not the only online climate activism. In the US, groups are preparing a three-day livestream to mark Earth Day, an annual event celebrated around the world on 22 April to demonstrate support for protecting the environment., Wednesday marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, when people around the world had been expected to mobilise to highlight the climate and ecological emergency., But the global lockdown has meant traditional protests and marches are impossible. Organisers say the 50th anniversary will be the first digital Earth Day with three days of online activism and a “a collective call for transformative action for our planet”., Among the events being planned are an global live stream bringing together youth and adult activists, celebrities and politicians including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Al Gore, Jane Fonda, and Joaquin Phoenix., On Thursday, as part of the Earth Day celebrations, the 350.org campaign group together with the Stop the Money Pipeline will hold online debates and talks highlighting how the fossil fuel industry is financed and outlining how people can take action against the largest financial backers like Chase bank and Barclays., Fridays For Future (FFF) is gearing up for a 24-hour livestream on 24 April to showcase strikers around the globe, and is hosting a regular weekly webinar, Talks for Future, which features climate scientists and other experts., Activists are also using the digital strikes to create Twitter storms, bombarding companies and people in power with tweets at a set time. Last month, FFF Digital and the Polluters Out campaign teamed up to target Shell and the Adani Group, demanding a stop to new fossil fuel projects., This new reliance on social media has created challenges and opportunities. For Leah Namugerwa, a 15-year old striker from Kampala, it has allowed her to better promote her online petition for Uganda to ban plastic bags, but it has also made it difficult for her to reach people. “My activism and message targets policymakers and people in power, but social media in Uganda isn’t widely used, especially by elder people in positions of power,” she says., Deniz Çevikus, 12, from Istanbul, who usually protests alone, enjoys talking to more people online. “During a typical solo strike I can talk to 20 or 30 people at most, but with the same digital strike I can reach thousands of people on social media,” she says., “Striking before the virus was more challenging because I skipped school every Friday, missed classes, had to make up for them later and stood for a few hours in cold weather. My persistence to strike at a different location each week made it even harder. This feels a bit like vacation.”, Dylan Hamilton, 15, from Linlithgow in Scotland, has dabbled with the video platform TikTok as a means of connecting with other young people. “I think it’s quite a good way of getting people involved. And also, we are just teenagers, so it’s nice to be a normal teenager and communicate with other teenagers that way.”, While the activists are embracing the potential for social media to help them get their message across in new ways, most agree they cannot wait to return to traditional on-the-ground campaigning., “We are more present on the streets, and we know it’s not a social media bubble – we’re reaching every single person that walks by us, not just the people who are already worried about the climate crisis,” Nielsen says., As the pandemic dominates headlines, the climate movement is trying to strike a difficult balance between continuing to stress the urgency of its cause while allowing space for coronavirus to take priority., “It’s very important to keep talking about climate change, but we also get that we need to focus on the coronavirus,” says Hamilton. “We know that you can’t do everything all at once.”, There is concern that the climate crisis could be sidelined for months if not longer, and that interest in climate strikes could dwindle – not least because the rebellious act of striking from school is not as powerful when schools are closed., “We’ve lost a bit of motivation,” Hamilton adds. “We don’t know when we’re going to be able to do the big protests again.”, But there is still cause for optimism. Many hope a break from continuous campaigning might bring activists back stronger, while among the tragedy of the pandemic the world has shown at least that it can change., “Seeing how things shifted so quickly gives us hope,” says Palmer. “When politicians tell us things don’t happen that fast, this is just evidence that it can be done. This was such a rapid response to a crisis. If we also treat the climate crisis like an emergency, like an imminent threat, it is definitely possible for us to achieve the world that we want.”climate strikes continue online we want to keep the momentum going", "label": 0}, "train-722": {"text": "\nCountry diary: blackbird song bookends the day\n, Sandy, Bedfordshire: From dawn to dusk, the male sings to warn off all who listen, \nDerek Niemann, \n\nWed 22 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, When a blackbird sings in the golden hour before dusk I am thrown back to feel the aching frustration of early childhood. As a wee boy in Cambuslang, I was sent up to bed while it was still light. Confined to my room, I half believed the bird outside my window was singing for me. Even now, I catch a yearning in its voice that reminds me of the self-pitying child lamenting the curtailment of playtime., This is nonsense, of course. I doubt there is anything elegiac or mournful in this blackbird’s last post from the topmost tip of the high spruce tree. He is the territory-proclaiming bookend at both ends of the day. I heard him before I was awake, and he is heralding the night., For this bird, height comes before a fall. He picked an upright that can’t quite carry his weight. It bends, he sways. He lifts his wings a little to steady himself and flicks them again. His body rocks, his tail balances, almost. Nevertheless, his throat rises above any physical discomfort down below, maintaining the melody, the far-carrying sounds that warn off all who listen., It is a feat of great vocal dexterity, two tympanic membranes working simultaneously to produce notes that can be sustained for half a second. And a blackbird rarely forgets. Every spring, it adds to its repertoire and, judging by its range, I would say this male has a few years under its wing., Eventually, the bough buckles once too often and the blackbird is sprung off to seek another perch. He won’t try for the even higher limes, the pinnacles of the neighbourhood, for two carrion crows sit dominant, black against a blackening sky., My own world is bounded by fences, for I have already taken my permitted walk of the day. But I am liberated by curiosity. The bare patch of earth at the pond’s edge has grown no bigger and the scatter of damp soil tossed out from a plantless trough has not been added to for about a week. This male’s female, having lined the bowl of her nest with a plaster of mud, must now be incubating. And so the male sings: my patch, my mate, my babies.country diary blackbird song bookends the day", "label": 0}, "train-723": {"text": "\nA tiny scientific marvel: Olaf the IVF toad brings hope to at-risk species\n, \nA tiny scientific marvel: Olaf the IVF toad brings hope to at-risk species\n, Amphibians are at the forefront of a battle against extinction – but they’re not the only ones benefiting from ‘frozen zoos’ , \nKatharine Gammon, \n\nWed 22 Apr 2020 00.00 EDT\n\n, Olaf grasps Diane Barber’s gloved hands with his sticky, four-fingered legs. His skin is bumpy and moist, the colour of pebbles at the bottom of a river when dappled sun hits them. Olaf’s eyes are deep amber. His body lifts and falls with each breath. “The males get really pretty,” says Barber, ectotherms curator at Fort Worth zoo in Texas. “Sometimes they’ll turn a solid yellow when they’re in breeding form.”, In some ways, this toad shouldn’t exist at all. He is the progeny of an egg from a captive mother and sperm from a wild father – a hybrid from parents who were both dead. Olaf is not the first amphibian to be born via IVF – that has been happening for years – but he is the first to be born from sperm that was frozen and thawed., “We were able to recover a genetic lineage that had disappeared, so we were able to produce an offspring from dead parents,” says Andy Kouba, an ecologist at Mississippi State University, who assisted with the project. “So that was an exciting first, to reintroduce genetic lines back into the population.”, Scientists have a lot of tools to conserve species, says Kouba, but they still need to hedge against extinction in the wild. One way could be to bank the genetic lineages of species by freezing sperm and egg deposits and then later thawing and combining them in a dish to create offspring., Amphibians are at the forefront of an uphill battle against extinction, losing a greater proportion of species than any other vertebrate group. The IUCN estimates that at least 41% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction. Habitat loss, climate crisis and a fungal disease all play a role in their demise., But amphibians are not the only species that can benefit from new technologies. In vitro fertilisation, hormone therapy and cryopreservation are increasingly being used as tools for conservation – for amphibians and beyond. In a fast-changing world, frozen zoos may be the places where tissues are kept, in the hope of boosting numbers or resurrecting species in the future., How did Olaf come to exist at all? A year ago in Puerto Rico, researchers captured six male toads, injected them with hormones and then collected the sperm they ejected when they urinated. The toads usually pee when picked up by humans, but the researchers also barked at them, Kouba explains, as toads urinate when frightened, and dogs barking are a sure-fire way to scare them. The males were then released back into the wild., The team of international scientists preserved the semen in liquid nitrogen and transported it to Fort Worth zoo, where female toads were injected with hormones to release eggs. Olaf and his roommates were created in a dish, eliciting cheers from the scientists when they hatched from their eggs., The idea of creating a frozen zoo first emerged in the 1970s, when a medical pathologist named Kurt Benirschke started banking animal sperm and eggs at San Diego zoo in the same way that human gametes were starting to be stored: in giant vials of liquid nitrogen that dropped the temperature of the materials to -196 F. When Benisrschke started banking genetic material, no technology existed to make use of it, but he believed it was important to carry on anyway., Now, biobanks for animal species – from fish to reptiles to birds and even snails and molluscs – are popping up around the globe. The Frozen Zoo repository at San Diego zoo holds more than 10,000 cell cultures from nearly 1,000 different species. They are mostly from mammals, but also from birds, reptiles and amphibians., Scientists had been working on the process of bringing together sperm and egg outside the bodies of animals like rabbits and guinea pigs since the 1870s. But making babies in a test tube is no simple task because every species is different. IVF success rates for mammals are much higher than with reptiles, and with some species, it’s incredibly low. Even within species, some cells are more difficult than others. When it comes to amphibians, Kouba says, their sperm is pretty simple to freeze – but eggs are not, because they are so much larger than the sperm. “Inside that cell, you have water content, and when you start to freeze anything with water, they form ice crystals that rupture the cell.”, Because fish such as salmon and cod are widely available commercially, they have been studied much more than amphibians, and amphibian researchers like Barber and Kouba are waiting for breakthroughs that they can adopt. “There is a huge interest in freezing sperm to move genetics around the world for commercially viable species,” Kouba says. , One reason that conservationists want to boost the numbers of amphibian populations is because diseases are devastating them in the wild. Kouba says cryopreservation has a place as a last-ditch effort to bank the remaining genetic material from a dying species, but that it is really better to take action before a species’ numbers have crashed. “We can produce tens of thousands for reintroduction, which may allow a species to return to a healthy population,” he says., That’s because amphibians have a naturally high mutation rate, so sending thousands of amphibians into the wild to mate and repopulate could mean they create a disease-resistant strain on their own. “You release animals with the hope that disease resistant lines will develop, and those animals will reproduce,” says Kouba., In Colorado, Jennifer Barfield is using IVF to create bison with healthy genes to introduce into existing wild herds. Left to their own devices, bison breed well but what they can’t do is move around the globe – so to transport new genes to different areas requires the use of IVF., Using assisted reproductive technologies, she has helped produce healthy Yellowstone bison from ones that had a bacterial disease called brucellosis and established a new conservation herd in Colorado called the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd., There is another advantage to using IVF in bison says Barfield. “Bio-banking the genetic preservation is just a good idea, like a form of genetic insurance. You never know how science will advance to use that material in the future.”, She says that one of the challenges in endangered species is that often researchers don’t know enough about the reproductive physiology of rare animals to apply solutions before the animals become extinct. “You can’t experiment on endangered species,” says Barfield., In some species, assisted reproduction is the last hope. There are only two remaining northern white rhinos left in the world, both female, both past reproductive age. Last year, researchers were able to harvest eggs from one of the females and have created three embryos with frozen sperm from dead males. The embryos are now frozen, with the hope of implanting them into surrogate southern white rhino females later this year. The eventual goal is to create five animals that could live in the wild in Africa – a plan that could take decades to come to fruition., Back at Fort Worth zoo, Barber carefully puts Olaf back in his cage in the isolation room. In the wild, Puerto Rican crested toads like Olaf spend 95% of their time in small holes between crushed rocks, coming out to feed at night and when it rains. In his home at the zoo, the staff have constructed small pyramids made from sections of white PVC pipes for Olaf and the other toads to hang out in. Of the toads that used to live in this room, 193 were recently shipped via FedEx back to Puerto Rico for reintroduction; now more are being raised here. Other rooms house frogs raised from other parts of North America, all in need of a population boost., Barber says that in the 1980s zoos thought of themselves as arks. “That was kind of the buzz word for zoos: we’re becoming arks instead of just having animals for exhibit. We need to start doing more about thinking about conservation and maintaining species long term.”, But those arks are full, and more species need assistance – there’s no space to keep animals just as an insurance policy. “We’re not arks, we’re life rafts,” Barber says. “And we have very limited seating.”, As she speaks about her passion for overlooked species, Barber’s eyes fill with emotion. “Especially with the stuff that I work with – the creepy crawlies – most people wonder: why should we care? And it’s like, well, we should care about everything because we’re all connected. Sometimes it’s just really hard to communicate why we should care and why it is our responsibility to try to mitigate things that we humans have caused.”, So far, IVF conservation work is only being done with about 10 species – but Kouba predicts it will become much more widespread in the next decade. “I think it’s going to become mainstream,” he says, adding that it could become a primary resource for conservation. “We left those species in the world and we were able to collect their material, bring it back and put new founder lines back in the population, so we don’t need to remove animals from the wild any more. , “That will revolutionise how we manage wildlife.”, This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Half a century later, this annual day unites millions across the globe, drawing attention to the huge challenges facing our planet., Now more than ever, Earth Day offers an opportunity for us all to reflect upon our relationship with the planet, amid the most powerful possible message that nature can surprise us at any moment, with devastating consequences for pretty much every individual. It is a time when the health of the planet and its people has never been so important., This year held great promise for environmental change on the back of growing pressure for concerted, urgent action and with a suite of international conferences set to refocus global commitment on these key issues. The nexus between nature, climate and sustainable development was embodied in 2020. The year offered hope., There was much talk of nature as the bridge between the biodiversity and climate crises, of nature-based solutions such as forestation, peatland restoration and the protection of mangroves as the answers to some of the challenges we face today, and of natural capital supporting sustainable development and human wellbeing., The postponement of COP15 and COP26 – the international conferences which were set to determine new global targets on biodiversity and climate change later this year – was, clearly, the right step to take when the world is grappling with a pandemic like coronavirus, but we should not let the momentum of what had been hailed as a “super year” for the environment be lost., We are in an age of extinction and at the point where irreversible environmental damage could be wrought. Despite changed plans, we cannot afford to lose pace nor focus. The challenge of the biodiversity and climate crises will still be there when the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted; the ambition of COP15 and COP26 must be carried forward and built upon in 2021.Right now, it may be hard not to feel despondent but there are shoots of optimism. After the lockdowns, we may may see greater appreciation for nature in many countries around the world. From China to Spain, people of all ages are missing what they did not know they would miss until they could not have it: craving open spaces; realising the wellbeing and health benefits of accessing nature; and, in many countries, missing the blossoming of spring., Some improvements in pollution levels have been seen in countries with restricted movements of people and the shutdown of factories and businesses. Will we be able to balance our need for these to reopen and our desire to travel while reducing the footprint of these kinds of activities?, Communities are coming together to support each other – even in large metropolises like London, which are so often perceived as hostile and cold. Can we harness this spirit to look out for those further from home and for the planet that supports us all when coronavirus becomes a distant memory?, A poster to mark the first Earth Day featured the quote: “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Fifty years on, will this be the year we collectively stop taking the planet for granted, degrading and exploiting its resources? Will we now, also, realise how vulnerable a species we actually are?, I hope that through our experience of this pandemic, we will learn that it is far better to pre-empt a global problem when we see it on the horizon than have to deal with it when it engulfs us. This is a lesson we should apply to the challenge of climate change, which also threatens hundreds of millions of people, as well as that of heeding and listening to the experts. We must also recognise that global challenges require globally coordinated responses.At the end of the year, we will still have a decade to deliver the sustainable development goals, and the biodiversity and climate change COPs – along with other key international meetings – will be rescheduled.Crucially, a window of opportunity is opening to ensure that economic recovery plans that countries adopt as they emerge from this crisis are steadfastly “green”. Long-term investment and sustainable economic growth plans should drive climate projects and environmental change. We need nature more than ever, as a solution, as a resource, for respite and for life on Earth.Looking ahead, there are opportunities emerging from this pandemic which, if seized, could set the path for a more fruitful 2021 “super year”.

This peaked across south-east England on 9 April, at eight on the 10-point UK air quality index., Values between four and six were measured over most of England and Wales. Spring smogs happen most years and typically result in air pollution at index eight to 10. So, the lockdown may have averted the worst impacts but why are we having any air pollution at all?, Chemical analysis by King’s College London reveals that the particles came from traffic and industry, gas heating and agriculture. The annual start to the agriculture cycle makes spring the most polluted time of year in western Europe. A global study showed that halving ammonia from farming could reduce the early deaths from air pollution in Europe by around 20%. This could be done by improving fertiliser spreading (also saving farmers money), changing animal feeds and better manure and slurry storage.

In particular, freshwater insects have been increasing by 11% each decade following action to clean up polluted rivers and lakes. However, this group represent only about 10% of insect species and do not pollinate crops., Researchers said insects remained critically understudied in many regions, with little or no data from South America, south Asia and Africa. Rapid destruction of wild habitats in these places for farming and urbanisation is likely to be significantly reducing insect populations, they said., Insects are by far the most varied and abundant animals, outweighing humanity by 17 times, and are essential to the ecosystems humanity depends upon. They pollinate plants, are food for other creatures and recycle nature’s waste., The previous largest assessment, based on 73 studies, led scientists to warn of “catastrophic consequences for the survival of mankind” if insect losses were not halted. Its estimated rate of decline was more than double that in the new study. Other experts estimate 50% of insects have been lost in the last 50 years., Recent analyses from some locations have found collapses in insect abundance, such as 75% in Germany and 98% in Puerto Rico. The new, much broader study found a lower rate of losses. However, Roel van Klink, of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, who led the research, said: “This 24% is definitely something to be concerned about. It’s a quarter less than when I was a kid. One thing people should always remember is that we really depend on insects for our food.”, The research, published in the journal Science, also examined how the rate of loss was changing over time. “Europe seems to be getting worse now – that is striking and shocking. But why that is, we don’t know,” said van Klink. In North America, the declines are flattening off, but at a low level., Elsewhere, data is much more sparse. “But we know from our results that the expansion of cities is bad for insects because every place used to be more natural habitat – it is not rocket science,” said van Klink. “This is happening in east Asia and Africa at a rapid rate. In South America, there is the destruction of the Amazon. There’s absolutely no question this is bad for insects and all the other animals there. But we just don’t have the data.”, Van Klink said the research showed that insects were faring only slightly better in nature reserves than outside protected areas. “We found that very striking and a bit shocking – it means something’s going wrong there.”, Losses of insects are driven by habitat destruction, pesticides and light pollution. The impact of the climate crisis was not clear in the research, despite obvious local examples. Van Klink said changes in heat and rain could harm some species while boosting others, even in the same location., But he highlighted another study showing that rising carbon dioxide levels are reducing the nutrients in plants and significantly cutting grasshopper abundances on prairies in Kansas, US. ”That is absolutely shocking, because that could be happening all over the world.”, Prof Dave Goulson, of the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new analysis, said: “People should be as concerned as ever about insects. It is great news that some aquatic insects seem to be increasing, probably from a very low level. But the bulk of insects are terrestrial and this new study confirms what was already clear: they have been declining for many decades.”, Matt Shardlow, the head of the conservation charity Buglife, said: “Many insect species are threatened with extinction and this study shows insect abundance is also declining at an unsustainable rate. While the estimate in this study is lower than some, it is still very steep. Massive abundance declines in flying insects remains a developing ecological disaster., In a comment article in Science, Maria Dornelas, of the University of St Andrews, and Gergana Daskalova, of the University of Edinburgh, said the new study was the largest and most complete meta-analysis to date. “Embracing nuance allows us to balance accurate reporting of worrying losses with hopeful examples of wins,” they said., Van Klink said: “We definitely have a lot of reason for concern, but I don’t think it’s too late. The increase in freshwater species makes us at least hopeful that if we put the right legislation in place, we can reverse these trends.”insect numbers down 25 since 1990 global study finds", "label": 0}, "train-728": {"text": "\nWhy few Britons pick fruit on our farm\n, For distancing reasons we are minimising the number of people on the campsite so only have room for those who have worked for us before, but we are keen to recruit local people and have been in touch with many, writes Andrew Chesson, Letters, \n\nThu 23 Apr 2020 13.22 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 23 Apr 2020 13.25 EDT\n\n, Re your article (‘Just not true’ we’re too lazy for farm work, say frustrated UK applicants, 20 April), we run a small soft fruit farm in Kent and have had about 700 applications for 50 places. There are a number of reasons we are not taking all UK workers., Our season runs from May to October, but many UK applicants will go back to their old jobs as soon as they start up again, leaving us with not enough labour to pick the crop. , For physical distancing reasons we are minimising the number of people on the campsite, so we only have room for those who have worked for us before, but we are keen to recruit local people and have been in touch with many. In the past we had a high dropout rate with UK workers. I think we all understand that the main reason seasonal work is unattractive is that bills must be paid year-round., Many people also seem to think that, because we employ foreign workers, we somehow pay less than the legal minimum. All our workers are paid at least the national living wage and some will earn well above that.

So once the current emergency has passed and we start to recover, our challenge will be to eradicate air pollution permanently and ensure the gains we’ve made through policies such as ULEZ continue.”, Although the figures show a big reduction in NO2, particulate pollution, which comes largely from domestic wood burning and agriculture, and which is very harmful to human health, remains a severe threat in London., Elizabeth Fonseca, an air quality expert at the Environmental Defence Fund Europe, said that long-term cleaner air was essential to protect people’s health., “Nitrogen dioxide pollution has gone down, but London recently saw huge spikes in dangerous particulate pollution. A few weeks’ or months’ improvement of just one pollutant doesn’t make lung disease and other ailments disappear.”, There is mounting evidence of detrimental health impacts of air pollution, through lung disease, heart attacks, asthma, effects on pregnancies and on intelligence levels., Research published on Monday also found that the five most polluted regions among 66 analysed in Italy, Spain, France and Germany accounted for 78% of all reported Covid-19 deaths in those areas., Another study looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates., In the UK NO2 has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last 10 years. A key policy to reduce levels involves clean air zones – such as the ultra-low emissions zone in London – where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres., But the coronavirus crisis has seen some councils delay the planned introduction of clean air zones., Many cities across Europe, and some in the UK, have begun to unveil ambitious cycling and walking schemes to ensure people can move around safely and maintain the environmental benefits, in terms of cleaner air and safer streets, that have come about amid the lockdown., Gary Fuller, an air pollution expert at King’s College London, welcomed Thursday’s figures and said the policies introduced in London and elsewhere proved air pollution could be tackled., He said: “Breathing bad air has had an intolerable impact of Londoners’ health for far too long … but even before the Covid lockdown, London’s air pollution was undergoing a dramatic change for the better., “Nitrogen dioxide in central London and along main bus routes was improving at some of the fastest rates we’ve ever measured. We need to remember these lessons going forward. These successes show that our city’s air pollution is not an intractable problem and that actions can bring results.”, Prof Stephen Holgate, an adviser on air quality at the Royal College of Physicians, said that although Covid-19 had wreaked havoc, the “dreadful virus has brought the importance of outdoor space and the environment into focus”., He added: “We’re all looking forward to the time when the lockdown is lifted, and once it does I sincerely hope we’ll be able to retain some of the new cleaner and greener habits we’ve developed.”toxic air over london falls by 50 at busiest traffic spots", "label": 0}, "train-730": {"text": "\nCan psychedelics treat climate grief?\n, Author Michael Pollan on whether drugs that comfort the terminally ill can also help people mourning the climate future, Mark Hertsgaard, \n\nThu 23 Apr 2020 05.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 23 Apr 2020 05.32 EDT\n\n, The dread that many people are feeling these days about the coronavirus is nothing new to those acquainted with climate grief. As terrible as the virus is, the heatwaves, droughts, fires and floods driven by an overheated planet have killed many more people. And if current trends persist, the death toll will increase exponentially through the end of the century. In the face of so much loss, grief is understandable., In his bestselling book How to Change Your Mind, journalist Michael Pollan reports that 80% of terminally ill patients in clinical trials at Johns Hopkins and New York universities felt less anxiety and depression after taking psychedelic drugs. Mark Hertsgaard, environment correspondent for the Nation and author of HOT: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth, interviewed Pollan about whether those same drugs might also benefit people struggling not with their own death as much as the death of loved ones, future generations, and civilization as we know it. The interview has been edited for length and clarity., MH: Let’s be clear – in those clinical trials, terminally ill patients took psychedelic drugs under close medical supervision, right? But the results sound remarkable, MP: Yes. Most of them had remarkable journeys that reset their thinking about death in many ways, removing their fear completely. And in most cases their depressions lifted., MH: Do those experiences and your other research suggest that psychedelic drugs can be an antidote to climate grief?, MP: The first person I talked to about this was Rachael Petersen, an environmentalist. She worked at the World Resources Institute developing software that allows you to watch fires around the world in real time to see whether deals to protect lands, specifically in the Amazon, were being honored or not. This was incredibly depressing work. She watched the Earth burn in real time and as a result entered into a serious depression. She received psychedelic therapy, and while it was not a panacea she felt it helped her, allowed her to reset and continue to do this difficult work., MH: How did that reset happen?, MP: I can’t speak for her, but one of the things psychedelics can do is help people find more hope in their circumstances. After these experiences, they tend to feel less isolated and more connected – more connected to other people, to the community, and to nature. It made her realize that there were a cohort of people like herself who’d been working on this issue a long time. They’ve seen us go backwards under the Trump administration, and they’re incredibly discouraged to the point of despair. To call it an antidote is perhaps a bit strong, but having an experience like this may help them deal with their depression., MH: If ‘antidote’ is too strong, would ‘treatment’ be a better word?, MP: Yeah, I think it is a potential treatment. Does it fix the environmental crisis? No. But keeping these people mentally healthy is very important to all of us. This could shift their thinking in ways that allow them to go on doing really hard work that they might otherwise give up in despair. I think the challenge is to organize a study, take a group of people who struggle with climate grief, and see if this could indeed help them sustain their commitment., MH: But climate grief is different in important ways from an individual facing a terminal diagnosis. Climate grief is not necessarily about your own death but more about the death of the world around you – a kind of collective, civilizational death, MP: Yeah, and here’s what the parallels break down a little bit, because part of what psychedelic therapy seems to do for individuals is reconcile them to death. And that sort of acceptance is the last thing you want in a climate activist!, MH: Are psychedelics relevant to climate grief in any other ways?, MP: Yes, and this applies not so much to activists as to all of us. Researchers at Imperial College London found that a single experience on psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, changes measures of what is called “nature connectedness” – the extent to which you feel you are a part of nature. In people who had a single psilocybin journey scores of “nature connectedness” went up consistently and fairly dramatically., This rings true to me and to many of the people I’ve interviewed. You are less likely to objectify nature after a psychedelic experience. A high dose psychedelic experience often shrinks the ego. The ego typically perceives the world as if there’s a single subject – you – while everything else is an object. This sort of egotism, I think, is at the heart of our environmental crisis – our ability to objectify nature and see ourselves as standing outside of it. Once you objectify something, it becomes a thing you can use for your own purposes, that you can exploit. So, to the extent the psychedelic experience seems to bring down these walls of ego and open up this powerful sense of connection, it has – at least theoretically – the potential to shift consciousness around the environment. And God knows we need that., MH: You’re a parent. I’m a parent; my daughter just turned 15. A big part of my climate grief relates to the future she’s going to inherit. And not just her but the countless other kids around the world in her generation. Can psychedelics be helpful to parents dealing with climate grief?, MP: I think potentially it can, to the extent that many years of doing this work has dug a certain groove in your mind. There’s a beautiful metaphor one of the neuroscientists working on psychedelic research in London offered me. Think of your mind as a hill covered in snow, and your thoughts are sleds going down that hill. The more rides on those sleds over time, the deeper become the grooves. After a while, there’s no other way to go down the hill but in those grooves. Think of psychedelics as a fresh snowfall that fills all the grooves, allowing you to take a new path down the hill., MH: I’ve covered climate change as a journalist for 30 years, and when people ask, I always say that the only solution to climate grief for me is taking action – doing something to make me feel I’m having an effect on this. Taking action is clearly a climate solution. Are psychedelic drugs, in a different way, also a climate solution?, MP: No, I wouldn’t go that far. I think they could be a climate tool, to help us fight the battle, keep up our morale. I think the action we take around our food choices – giving up meat, for example – is more certain to have a positive effect than taking psychedelics … But what’s exciting and new is that we’re coming to recognize psychedelics’ therapeutic value. We face existential crises on the order of someone facing a terminal diagnosis. And the fact that psychedelics can help those people is reason enough to explore their relevance for people facing that more collective sense of existential dread., This story originally appeared in the Nation and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration committed to strengthening coverage of the climate storycan psychedelics treat climate grief", "label": 0}, "train-731": {"text": "\nCould Microsoft’s climate crisis ‘moonshot’ plan really work?\n, \nCould Microsoft’s climate crisis ‘moonshot’ plan really work?\n, The tech giant’s pledge to go carbon negative by 2030 leans heavily on nascent technology such as machines that suck carbon out of the air, \nOscar Schwartz in New York, \n\nThu 23 Apr 2020 05.08 EDT\n\n, Microsoft drew widespread praise in January this year after Brad Smith, the company’s president, announced their climate “moonshot”., While other corporate giants, such as Amazon and Walmart, were pledging to go carbon neutral, Microsoft vowed to go carbon negative by 2030, meaning they would be removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they produced., By 2050, Smith added, the company was aiming to remove all of the carbon they had ever emitted since being founded in 1975., The firm’s promises won plaudits from conservationists and climate conscious Microsoft employees, but also attracted big questions: how are they going to actually deliver this?, Much of its plans lean on nascent technology. Critics, meanwhile, see the move as a gamble aimed at justifying Microsoft’s ongoing deals with fossil fuel firms., Microsoft releases less carbon a year than Amazon and Apple, but more than Google. The company has 150,000 employees across offices in more than 100 countries, and is still focused on developing the software and consumer electronics that made them a household name – Windows, PCs, Xbox. But after a temporary slump following their heyday in the 1990s, they have also once again become innovators, developing world-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing products., The company hopes to bring that innovative approach to its climate policies, in part by widening how it calculates its carbon footprint, beyond most corporate responsibility plans. Historically, Microsoft has only counted those emissions that fall within the scope of their own business operations – employee travel, company vehicles, heat and electricity in company buildings, and so on., From now on, it plans to take responsibility for the emissions produced by its entire supply chain, including the full lifespan of the products it makes and the electricity that customers may consume when using its products., Meanwhile, increasing the scrutiny on Microsoft’s plan are its dealings with fossil fuel companies, which have been highlighted by some as evidence of hypocrisy as it makes climate pledges. In 2019 alone, the technology company had entered into long-term partnerships with three major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, that will be using Microsoft’s technology to expand oil production by as much as 50,000 barrels a day over the coming years. The staggering amount of carbon this would release into the atmosphere would not be included on Microsoft’s expanded carbon ledger., It will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps, For Microsoft, however, partnering with oil companies is not considered hypocritical. The company is hedging its climate bets on carbon capture and removal technologies that they believe will be able to offset some of the environmental harm caused by fossil fuels during the transition to a more sustainable future, despite such technologies being still in their nascent stages and not yet proven to work at scale., Those who devised the plan at Microsoft argue that they are responding directly to a new reality: cutting emissions is not enough and all routes to non-catastrophic temperature increase will also require removing carbon from the atmosphere. So, as well as shifting to a 100% supply of renewable energy for all of their data centers, buildings and campuses by 2025, Microsoft outlines a number of carbon reduction methods it is backing to try and hit its bold targets., To begin, Microsoft will focus on protecting forests and planting trees to capture carbon. This strategy has long been used to offset emissions, but Microsoft is hoping to improve their outcomes by using remote-sensing technology to accurately estimate the carbon storage potential of forests to ensure no major deforestation is occurring in their allotments. To achieve these goals, Microsoft will be partnering with Pachama, a Silicon Valley startup that will survey 60,000 hectares of rainforest in the Amazon, plus an additional 20,000 hectares across north-eastern states of the US for the company., According to Kesley Perlman, a climate campaigner at the forest conservation NGO Fern, Microsoft’s commitment to hi-tech reforestation is encouraging, but she stressed that conservation is a complex, multifaceted process that goes beyond technical issues. “It’s not only about how much carbon a forest can hold but also who traditionally uses the forest, how they might be kept out, and how biodiversity will be prioritized,” she said. , Microsoft will initially focus on nature-based solutions to reduce their carbon footprint over the next five or so years. But in order to start drawing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit by 2030, it will need to shift to technology-based solutions that can scale up and accelerate carbon removal., To this end, Microsoft is betting on biomass energy carbon capture storage, otherwise known as BECCS, to transform how energy is generated. Instead of burning coal, a BECCS power plant burns biomass, like wood chips. The carbon produced when burning the biomass is captured before it is released into the atmosphere and then injected at a very high pressure into rock formations deep underground. Not only does this remove carbon from the natural cycle, the biomass absorbs CO2 as it grows., A world powered by biofuel, however, raises two looming questions. First, scientists are not yet certain if biomass energy will be carbon neutral., The second concern is that the transition from coal to biofuel would require setting aside vast tracts of arable land – some estimates say one to two times the size of India. According to climate campaigner Perlman this would mean that the energy industry would probably have to compete with food production in a world where 10 billion people will need to be fed, while vastly enlarging industrialized plantations and reducing biodiversity. “We would likely see massive land use change and massive private purchases of land, the knock on impacts of which could be quite dangerous,” she said., Perhaps the most futuristic of the technologies outlined in Microsoft’s carbon negative plan is direct air capture (DAC). This involves machines that essentially function like highly efficient artificial trees, drawing existing carbon out of the air and transforming it into non-harmful carbon-based solids or gasses., While the image of air-conditioner-like machines sucking carbon out of the air is captivating, capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere requires a lot of energy and is very expensive. In 2011, extracting carbon from the air cost $600 a ton of CO2. In 2018, estimates brought this down to anywhere between $94 to $232 a ton. But given that Microsoft expects to emit 16m metric tons of carbon this year, if they were to reach carbon zero using only DAC, their bill might cost as much as $3.5bn., According to Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft, a large part of the reason why carbon removal remains so expensive is because the markets around these technologies are still immature. The company’s strategy over the coming decades is maturing these markets through intensive and directed investment. “We’re making a bet on certain technologies that don’t exist at the scale or price point we need them to,” he said. “But if we want to get them, we need to start investing.”, The company, he said, already has a model for raising funds internally to support climate innovation. In July 2012, Microsoft became one of the first companies to institute an internal carbon price, charging different divisions in the business $15 a metric ton of carbon emitted. The funds raised were then used to pay for sustainability improvements, which helped the company achieve their goal of going carbon neutral., Previously, this carbon price only extended over emissions Microsoft was directly responsible for. According to their new plan, in July this year Microsoft will extend this internal carbon price over emissions produced across direct and indirect emissions. The increased revenue raised from the expanded internal carbon tax, along with a $1bn climate innovation fund, will be used to invest in capture and removal technology. “What we’re going to do is put this money in the market in a way that is highly additional,” Joppa said. “This is how we’re going to get nature-based solutions and tech solutions at a price point and scale we need.”,  Microsoft’s plan for intensive investment in this industry is exciting for those working in the field. Klaus Lackner, a theoretical physicist working on DAC, has been arguing since the 1990s that carbon removal is the only feasible way to stop significant temperature rises. “We’ve shown that this method is technologically feasible, but nobody has wanted them,” he said. “Microsoft have said ‘we get it’. It will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps.”, While the technologies that Microsoft are betting on are still in their nascent stages, in the past few years there has been some encouraging progress in the negative emissions industry. Lackner and Arizona State University recently signed a deal with Silicon Kingdom, an Irish-based company, to manufacture his carbon-suck machines. The plan is to install them on wind and solar farms, and then sell the captured carbon to beverage companies to make carbonated drinks. In the UK, Drax power plant, which was once among Europe’s most polluting, transitioned from coal to biofuel this year., But many attempts at scaling carbon negative projects have also failed. The Kemper Project in Mississippi, which was billed as America’s flagship carbon capture project, was abandoned in 2017 – it was $5bn over budget, three years late and still not operational., Given the not insignificant risk of failure, some propose that relying on nascent or future technology as a solution to the climate crisis represents a moral hazard – the promise of carbon removal functions as an incentive for governments and major polluters to not change their behavior now., It’s extremely hard to lead if there’s no one there to follow, According to Chris Adams, a tech worker who organizes an online community of technology professionals agitating for climate action from within the industry, the fact that Microsoft is still partnering with big oil companies demonstrates the moral hazard in action. “They are protecting the fossil fuel industry from changing while the rest of the world will pay most from this gamble if it fails in the long term,” he said., Adams added that many of the encouraging ideas around carbon reduction in Microsoft’s plan have come from internal organizing from concerned employees, but that this mostly goes unacknowledged in Microsoft’s official vision. Emphasizing future technology while overlooking activism in the present, Adams said, represents a certain way of approaching problems that is typical of technology companies. “If you have spent the last 10 years amassing influence by approaching most problems with technology it’s understandable you see all problems through this lens, particularly if you don’t have to have conversations about power,” he said., When asked about this concern by the Guardian, Microsoft’s Joppa responded that in the short term, the energy demands of a growing global population will probably still need a mix of renewable and traditional energy sources. By remaining in discourse with these industries, he said, Microsoft hopes to help them change and transition to a better model in the future. “It’s extremely hard to lead if there’s no one there to follow,” he added., As to whether the technology outlined in their plan will scale, he said there is inherent risk, but this is why they call it a “moonshot”. “When it comes to our plan it’s not like we’ve got it all figured out,” he said. “We’re just trying to do what the science says the whole world needs to do. There’s really no other choice.”, This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

There is a voice inside my head and it’s not mine. The voice belongs to a song thrush. He began singing at the waxing moon, a couple of days before it was full, and sang until it began to wane. He would start at dawn from the topmost branch of one tree, then move to the topmost branch of another in the afternoon until the moon rose. Each day he did the same and his song followed the same patterns but never exactly: each phrase repeated three or four times, some sharp and yellow as celandines, some soft and blue as violets., Song is the wrong word; the thrush laid a promise, a grimoire of magical objects cast into the sky, to bridge sunrise to moonrise, to go silently into woods of the night and then return to the fantastic idea that shook his body and mind each day. There is nothing more urgent than this, nothing that draws joy and pain through the public air until all delight is gone. “Birds are noisy,” says a voice behind the fence. The loudest voice raised against death, that’s his because (not that he needs one). Then he stopped. It was as if the air was exhausted and became too thin to carry him, until the midnight hailstorm., The following morning, the thrush broke radio silence when there was a cool wave through trees and across gardens and fields on which to skim his oratory. Broadcasting in short durations, morning and evening, from different trees, sometimes missing a whole or most of the day, this was no longer the crazy obsessive. This was the voice returned as a bird, louder than blackbirds and robins but a thrush nevertheless, as bright and imperial as a dandelion.country diary thrush song promise magic", "label": 0}, "train-733": {"text": "\nFlooding will affect double the number of people worldwide by 2030\n, New research finds 147 million will be hit by floods by the end of the decade – ‘the numbers will be catastrophic’, \nEmily Holden in Washington, \n\nThu 23 Apr 2020 00.01 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 23 Apr 2020 00.02 EDT\n\n, The number of people harmed by floods will double worldwide by 2030, according to a new analysis., The World Resources Institute, a global research group, found that 147 million people will be hit by floods from rivers and coasts annually by the end of the decade, compared with 72 million people just 10 years ago., Damages to urban property will soar from $174bn to $712bn per year., By 2050, “the numbers will be catastrophic,” according to the report. A total of 221 million people will be at risk, with the toll in cities costing $1.7tn yearly., When WRI first developed its flood modeling tool in 2014, the predictions felt “like a fantasy”, said Charlie Iceland, director of water initiatives at WRI., “But now we’re actually seeing this increase in magnitude of the damages in real time,” Iceland said. “We’ve never seen these types of floods before.”, Floods are getting worse because of the climate crisis, decisions to populate high-risk areas and land sinkage from the overuse of groundwater., The worst flooding will come in south and south-east Asia, including in Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Indonesia and China, where large populations are vulnerable., The effects will be less dire but still increasingly serious in the US, where the risk is highest for coastal flooding.

The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory., Leonardo Setti at the University of Bologna in Italy, who led the work, said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution., “I am a scientist and I am worried when I don’t know,” he said. “If we know, we can find a solution. But if we don’t know, we can only suffer the consequences.”, Two other research groups have suggested air pollution particles could help coronavirus travel further in the air., A statistical analysis by Setti’s team suggests higher levels of particle pollution could explain higher rates of infection in parts of northern Italy before a lockdown was imposed, an idea supported by another preliminary analysis. The region is one of the most polluted in Europe., Neither of the studies by Setti’s team have been peer-reviewed and therefore have not been endorsed by independent scientists. But experts agree their proposal is plausible and requires investigation., Previous studies have shown that air pollution particles do harbour microbes and that pollution is likely to have carried the viruses causing bird flu, measles and foot-and-mouth disease over considerable distances., The potential role of air pollution particles is linked to the broader question of how the coronavirus is transmitted. Large virus-laden droplets from infected people’s coughs and sneezes fall to the ground within a metre or two. But much smaller droplets, less than 5 microns in diameter, can remain in the air for minutes to hours and travel further., Experts are not sure whether these tiny airborne droplets can cause coronavirus infections, though they know the 2003 Sars coronavirus was spread in the air and that the new virus can remain viable for hours in tiny droplets., But researchers say the importance of potential airborne transmission, and the possible boosting role of pollution particles, mean it must not be ruled out without evidence., Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics., How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity., This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden resurgence in infections despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak., Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in cramped dormitory accommodation used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens., Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it., Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies., The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available., In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with a vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves., Peter Beaumont, Prof Jonathan Reid at Bristol University in the UK is researching airborne transmission of coronavirus. “It is perhaps not surprising that while suspended in air, the small droplets could combine with background urban particles and be carried around.”, He said the virus had been detected in tiny droplets collected indoors in China., Setti said tiny droplets between 0.1 and 1 micron may travel further when coalesced with pollution particles up to 10 microns than on their own. This is because the combined particle is larger and less dense than the droplet and can remain buoyed by the air for longer., “The pollution particle is like a micro-airplane and the passengers are the droplets,” said Sett. Reid is more cautious: “I think the very small change in the size of the combined particles is unlikely to play much of a role.”, Prof Frank Kelly at Imperial College London said the idea of pollution particles carrying the virus further afield was an interesting one. “It is possible, but I would like to see this work repeated by two or three groups.”, Another expert, Prof John Sodeau at University College Cork, in the Republic of Ireland, said: “The work seems plausible. But that is the bottom line at the moment, and plausible particle interactions are not always biologically viable and may have no effect in the atmosphere.” He said the normal course of scientific research might take two or three years to confirm such findings., Other research has indicated correlations between increased Covid-19 deaths and higher levels of air pollution before the pandemic. Long-term exposure to dirty air is known to damage lung health, which could make people more vulnerable to Covid-19., • Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?coronavirus detected particles air pollution", "label": 0}, "train-736": {"text": "\nThe plight of the cuckoo: a 4,000-mile flight followed by golf\n, Study sheds light upon migratory cycle of bird to help understand alarming decline, \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nFri 24 Apr 2020 09.26 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 24 Apr 2020 10.46 EDT\n\n, When you’ve just braved sandstorms, thunderstorms and drought during a 4,000-mile solo flight in search of romance, what is your first priority?, For Carlton II the cuckoo, it appears to be a relaxing round of golf. The satellite-tagged bird became the first of a small flock of tracked cuckoos to return to his breeding grounds in record time, dashing from the Ivory Coast to southern England in seven days., The British Trust for Ornithology’s satellite tag revealed that upon nearing home, Carlton II stopped at Dulwich &amp; Sydenham Hill golf club in south London before a brief visit to Farnham Park golf club in Berkshire. He then moved on to another golf course at nearby Burnham Beeches., Carlton II – named after his favourite nature reserve, Carlton Marshes, in Suffolk – may have some time on his hands after overtaking two other cuckoos tracked by the BTO. PJ and Senan are currently feeding in Spain and North Africa., The nine-year tagging study in which young birds are tagged each year is shedding new light upon the migratory cycle of the cuckoo, helping scientists understand the species’ alarming decline., The call that once echoed across valleys in spring is increasingly rare: Britain has lost three-quarters of its breeding cuckoos over the last 25 years., Dr Chris Hewson, BTO lead scientist on the project, said: “It is great to see Carlton II getting back to the UK so quickly. Taking just a week to cover more than 3,000 miles from Liberia to Berkshire is an awesome feat and something even swifts don’t manage., “This shows us just how quickly these harbingers of spring can get here from tropical Africa when conditions for their journey are good. It’s a journey so full of hazards that it’s always a relief when they get back, no matter how fast or slow., “These cuckoos have taught us so much about their lives, giving answers but also raising more questions as to what might be behind their decline.”, Pressures along their route, including habitat loss but also drought caused by climate change, are making the cuckoo’s epic journeying more hazardous., Carlton II has clocked up 22,000 miles since he was fitted with an ultra-light tag at Carlton Marshes in 2018 but still has a way to go to emulate the travels of Chris Packham, a cuckoo named after the naturalist and broadcaster., Chris the cuckoo returned to Britain for four successive summers, flying more than 50,000 miles and traversing 28 different countries on his migration from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe. On one occasion, the bird diverted hundreds of miles off his usual course to Angola.

This brought us on a sunny Sunday morning to the foot of Wimble Holme Hill. The name is a delight: the root of Wimble has been offered as “wime”, a dialect word meaning to take a circuitous route. Streams wime. Bees wime. And when confronted with the alarmingly steep slope of Wimble Holme Hill, so do humans, who most usually take the narrow road that loops to the north at a more reasonable angle., We, on the other hand, were up for a challenge and took the hill direct, which brought us immediately to a tangle of gorse. Here I stopped, not to catch my breath – we’d hardly started – but to listen to the rasping call of a greenfinch., For years, from one summer to the next, I would lie half-awake in the morning listening to this sound, like an elongated wheeze, emerging from a conifer outside my bedroom window: a lazy, delicious sound that encouraged me to stay just where I was. Then, around the middle of the past decade, my garden greenfinches, my confrères in idleness, disappeared, presumably victims of the trichomonosis outbreak that caused such a precipitous decline in their numbers. And despite the recent recovery, they’ve not returned to my garden yet. Summer hasn’t been the same since., I could see why the greenfinches were thriving on Wimble Holme Hill. Plenty of cover, but also some benefactor had hung a couple of feeders from the bushes, crammed with sunflower seeds. Half-hidden behind the gorse was a circular wall of black bricks, the stub of what might have been a massive chimney but is, in fact, the opening of an airshaft to the railway tunnel that runs under Totley Moor., Built in the early 1890s, this huge project had its own story of sudden loss: the graveyard in nearby Dore has headstones to the victims of a smallpox outbreak that occurred among the navvies and their families during construction, unnamed victims of the march of progress. A railway tunnel might never wime, but the path of humans – and greenfinches – does little else.country diary following the wiming paths of greenfinches", "label": 0}, "train-738": {"text": "\nBushfires leave 470 plants and 200 animals in dire straits – government analysis\n, The most severely affected invertebrates and plants lost at least 30% of habitat to the fires, \nLisa Cox, \n\nSat 25 Apr 2020 16.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 25 Apr 2020 20.02 EDT\n\n, More than 400 plants and nearly 200 invertebrates need urgent attention after the bushfire crisis, new analysis for the federal environment department has found., Freshwater mussels, shrimps, burrowing crayfish, land snails, spiders, millipedes, bees, dragonflies and butterflies were among the invertebrates whose ranges have been severely affected by the unprecedented fires through spring and summer., The most severely affected species have had at least 30% of their range burned, and in some cases the figure was much higher., Publication of the list of 471 plants and 191 invertebrates comes as business groups and governments emphasise the need to reduce bureaucracy around environmental assessments as part of the economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis., Australia’s national environment laws – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act – are being independently reviewed but the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said this week she was prepared to introduce legislative changes before it the review was complete., The government has not said what those changes might be, but it has emphasised its desire to speed up assessments for major projects., Environmental advocates have stressed the act has been failing to stem Australia’s high rate of extinction and the need to improve the system of protections has been made more urgent by the bushfire crisis., As well as the 191 invertebrate species listed as needing urgent attention, 147 have been prioritised for further assessment., And the invertebrate analysis, compiled by a conservation biologist, John Woinarski, acknowledged that those figures were likely to be an underestimate of the impact of the fires on Australia’s invertebrate species because of large gaps in knowledge about these species., Australia has about 320,000 invertebrates – much greater than the number of vertebrate or plant species – and monitoring of even the most threatened is often lacking., “Assessment of the impacts of the 2019-20 fires on Australian invertebrates is also constrained by the absence or limited extent of monitoring of Australian invertebrates, with little monitoring even for most threatened invertebrate species,” the report said., “In the absence of such monitoring, it is difficult to evaluate the extent of loss, or progress to recovery, of most invertebrate species.”, The lists were developed using maps of fire grounds and the known ranges of threatened and near-threatened species, as well as species for which state agencies had signalled particular concern., The 471 plants include a variety of vegetation types, among them trees and shrubs in rainforest areas that do not regularly burn. One species, monga waratah, had 50% of its range burned., “Some species were considered threatened before the fires, and the fires have now likely increased their risk of extinction,” the department’s summary said., The plant analysis, led by Dr Rachael Gallagher from Macquarie University, said some species such as the forrester’s bottlebrush, betka bottlebrush and grey deua pomaderris are at imminent risk of extinction because all their known or modelled range has been burned, and they are exposed to significant other stresses such as pre-fire drought conditions, high fire frequency or severity, or diseases., It said the Wollemi pines were a priority for immediate action to mitigate post-fire impacts, along with several species of ground orchid., The Greens environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said she was concerned that EPBC review would not account for “the full impact” of the bushfires because much of the assessment work was still to be done., “How could you have a comprehensive and extensive review without factoring in that information, given the baseline has now changed?” she said., The government has committed to $50m in funding for wildlife recovery after the bushfires. As part of that, it has set aside $12m for grants for recovery work for plants and invertebrates.bushfires leave 470 plants and 200 animals in dire straits government analysis", "label": 0}, "train-739": {"text": "\nBritish farmers turn to homegrown force to bring in the harvest\n, With Covid-19 keeping eastern Europeans away, furloughed British workers are signing up to fill seasonal vacancies – but will there be enough of them? , \nJamie Doward, \n\nSat 25 Apr 2020 10.05 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 25 Apr 2020 16.28 EDT\n\n, Right now, Bruce Kerr is fretting about the shape of a certain curve – but not the one relating to the spread of Covid-19., Kerr is an asparagus farmer in east Suffolk. In a good year he will harvest up to 500 tonnes of the highly prized vegetable, which requires urgent attention when the mercury rises., “If we get hot temperatures we have to pick all at once,” Kerr explained. “We really need to flatten the curve.”, Normally, an all-hands-on-deck scenario would not be a problem. Kerr’s 100-plus-strong workforce of eastern Europeans would do the job., But, like most farmers now, Kerr is largely bereft of Romanians and Bulgarians to pick his crop for a harvest that traditionally begins on St George’s Day and runs to Midsummer on 21 June., The good news, though, is he is not bereft of workers. “I took to Twitter a few weeks ago and the floodgates opened,” he explains., His offer of work was answered by furloughed chefs, hotel staff, students, landscape workers and musicians. They have come from Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds but Kerr is keen to recruit the majority of his new workforce from the local community., “It’s a tough gig, some won’t stick with it,” Kerr acknowledged. “It’s not like Kent during the war with people picking apples and dancing. But we now have British people picking British asparagus. As of this weekend, we have 50 people picking asparagus who have never picked it before.”, Kerr can count himself one of the luckier ones., We have been pleasantly surprised by how many people are interested in doing the picking., Other farmers still have a mountain to climb when it comes to recruiting workers. Admittedly, there is still time. The main fruit and vegetable picking season does not begin until late May but the clock is ticking., A spokesman for Angus Growers, a soft fruit producer on Scotland’s east coast, the heart of the country’s berry industry, said its recruitment drive has received more than 4,700 applications from 2,714 individual applicants. But, to date, only 141 had accepted a job and were in post, a conversion rate of around 5%., “We do appreciate that berry picking is very hard work,” the spokesman said. “It’s a very physical job, and due to the nature of the industry, skill and speed are required in order to harvest berries quickly and efficiently once the fruit ripens. The reasons given for declining the roles are varied, but include the long hours, early starts, and the fact that these roles are contracted for a specific period of weeks which are not flexible.”, Feed the Nation, a drive to recruit British-based workers launched by the Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers, received nearly 50,000 applications of interest. Of those, just over 6,000 opted to complete an interview for a job. To date, 900 have rejected the job offered while 112 have taken one up., “You can see that turning interest into actual applicants is pretty challenging, that’s why we are going to need to get tens of thousands of people interested in the work,” said NFU vice-president Tom Bradshaw., “I think we’re nervous. But we’ve never been in this situation where we have the number of people available that we have now. There could be two million unemployed now and we’ve also got all of the university students who would maybe travel through the summer and now won’t be. So there is a large pool of people available who haven’t been previously. The picking vacancies for April have all been filled and that gives us some confidence we may well be able to fill the roles.”, In a bid to raise interest, the government will soon start promoting PickforBritain.org – an online campaign soft-launched earlier this month that aims to recruit more farm workers from within Britain., “There’s been a huge amount of interest but the jobs aren’t really available until the end of May, beginning of June,” Bradshaw said., “We have been pleasantly surprised by how many people are interested in doing it but we need to keep up that momentum as we head to peak recruitment.”, Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits, the industry body, said its campaign had attracted huge interest, too., “Over a third of farms now have enough applicants for the roles they have available,” Marston said., But that still leaves big gaps, despite the use of charter flights to bring in eastern European workers amid warnings crops would go unpicked., At the end of March, there were only around 7,000 eastern European workers in Britain’s fields, according to Bradshaw – less than 10% of the total workforce that will be required over the year., “There’s still a long way to go,” Bradshaw said. “It could well be we need 50,000 or 60,000 people.”, Alastair Brooks, who farms strawberries in Kent, has secured the 170-strong workforce he needs to pick his fruit. Many of his workers from eastern Europe arrived over the winter and avoided the lockdown., “But talking to the rest of the industry, it’s a little bit mixed,” Brooks said. “A lot of people live in the south-east and if you are a sous chef you might think maybe this is all right for a few months. If you live in some of the more rural areas, then maybe they don’t have access to the same number of people.”, Other farmers face a different problem: their markets have disappeared., “We normally harvest between 10 and 12 tonnes per year,” said Richard Morritt, who has been growing asparagus at Sand Hutton in Yorkshire for 21 years., “Most of that harvest goes into the restaurant and hospitality trade. With a potential drop in sales, I may have to think about harvesting to what the demand is from my customers. Some fields I may not harvest this year. At least with asparagus, it being a perennial crop, the spears will develop into fern and grow out for this season. It will still be there next year to harvest again. If I’m standing still this year, it’s been a great year.”farmers turn to homegrown force to bring in the harvest", "label": 0}, "train-740": {"text": "\nBirds join chorus of approval as wildlife thrives in a quieter world\n, \nBirds join chorus of approval as wildlife thrives in a quieter world\n, Deer roam city streets and hedgehogs can safely cross roads… but a radical policy shift is needed to protect wildlife in future, say campaigners , \nStephen Moss, \n\nSat 25 Apr 2020 09.55 EDT\n\n, Britain’s wildlife may be thriving during the current lockdown but its long-term future is looking bleak, according to leading conservation organisations., Nikki Williams, head of campaigns at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “The current crisis means nature is losing out, because many organisations are having to scale back important work caring for special places, which they usually do with the vital help of thousands of volunteers.”, Just one example, she said, was the continual battle with the invasive plant Himalayan balsam, which smothers riverbanks and out-competes native wildflowers. If left to its own devices over the summer, this plant will be even harder to eradicate next year., Meanwhile, valuable habitats, such as lowland heaths in southern England and East Anglia, need continual management to ensure they do not turn back into scrub, reducing the opportunities for specialised creatures such as the Dartford warbler, sand lizard and smooth snake., While staff and volunteers are unable to do the majority of conservation work, they are still able to carry out surveys, for example of breeding birds, many of which are run by the British Trust for Ornithology., One noticeable phenomenon of late has been the daily chorus of birdsong, especially in the heart of our cities., According to the BTO’s Paul Stancliffe, the current lack of noise might indeed be helping singing birds to be heard by potential mates and rivals, thus increasing their breeding success. He said we wouldn’t know if that was the case unless crucial survey work continued. This is why the BTO has offered free membership of its Garden BirdWatch scheme, signing up more than 5,000 new observers, many of whom have urban gardens, whose birdlife often goes under-recorded., Mathew Frith, of the London Wildlife Trust, said: “Many of our birds, such as the robin, wren, chiffchaff, skylark and meadow pipit, nest on or close to the ground, and so are easily flushed by dogs. With parks so much quieter than usual, these species may do well this spring.”, The RSPB also notes that the lack of people visiting the seaside will help shore-nesting species such as little terns and ringed plovers, which are especially prone to being disturbed by holidaymakers., As well as the possible benefits to birds of the current reduction in noise and disturbance, some animals also appear to be flourishing. There have been reports of goats roaming the streets of Llandudno, and fallow deer in the east London suburbs, along with numerous sightings of normally shy mammals such as moles, stoats and weasels., The lack of traffic is especially helpful for mammals that are vulnerable to being run over by vehicles, such as hedgehogs and badgers., The big question for conservationists is what will happen when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Any short-term gains made by wildlife may vanish once people, traffic and other aspects of daily life returned to some kind of “normal”, but if our habits do permanently change, as many people are hoping, nature might reap the benefit., But that will also depend on pushing through recent shifts in government policy, as the Wildlife Trusts’ Williams points out. “When the crisis ends, wildlife will still be in decline. The only way to ensure its recovery is to create strong agriculture and environment bills, which put nature, and all the benefits it brings, at the heart of policy and our daily lives.”birds join chorus of approval as wildlife thrives in a quieter world", "label": 0}, "train-741": {"text": "\nTales of love and loss: people from Oceania share their 'extinction stories'\n, \nTales of love and loss: people from Oceania share their 'extinction stories'\n, The Living Archive aims to help people worldwide see the significance of species loss as it affects individual lives and places, Kate Evans, \n\nSat 25 Apr 2020 01.30 EDT\n\n, The first time poet Craig Santos Perez encountered a bird native to his homeland of Guam it was in a cage at San Diego zoo., Growing up on Guam in the 1980s and 90s, Perez, a native Chamorro, had learned about the island’s lost birds at school. Children studied pictures and listened to audio recordings of their calls – but by then, the island’s forests were silent., Of Guam’s original 12 species of forest birds, ten had been eaten to extinction by the invasive brown tree snake. Just two narrowly escaped its jaws: the Guam rail and an endemic subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher, which the Chamorro call sihek., In the late 1980s, the last siheks were taken off the island to be reared in captive breeding programmes at zoos on the American mainland. Though there are now plans to release some on Guam, they are still considered extinct in the wild., That day at the zoo, Perez finally came face to face with a real-life sihek, its gold-and-turquoise feathers shining behind the bars. “It was very profound, very touching – I talked to it, and started crying,” he says., To Perez, the bird’s fate echoed that of his people: San Diego is home to the largest diaspora of Chamorros outside of Guam. For many years, Perez was one of them. “We migrate to survive and to have better opportunities, but at the same time, we’re far from home, we’re in a new situation, and it can be very traumatic – for the sihek as well as the people.”, A poem Perez wrote about the sihek is among those featured on the Living Archive, a new multimedia web platform that provides a space for people from Oceania to tell their “extinction stories”., “When a species goes extinct, so much is lost,” says Perez, who is now an associate professor of English at the University of Hawaii. “Not only from the environment and the ecosystem, but culturally as well. We lose our cultural connection to these important species, and we lose the deep meaning that they added to our lives.”, The site is the brainchild of Thom van Dooren, an Australian environmental philosopher at the University of Sydney. He hopes it will be a way of creating space for others – especially the Pacific’s indigenous peoples, but anyone is welcome to contribute – to share their tales of love and loss. A storytelling competition will be held later in the year., As the sixth great extinction gathers pace, stories are more important than ever, van Dooren says. “Focusing on stories is about moving away from the simple listing of endangered species., “Multiplying voices and diverse perspectives from around the world helps us to see the significance of extinction as it actually touches down in particular lives and places.”, In Indonesia’s West Papua province, it is the disappearance of the sago palm that is causing heartbreak for the indigenous Marind people. To the Marind, the plant is of central significance for both subsistence and cosmology, but Papua is the new oil palm frontier, and as plantations spread across the landscape, groves of sago are being destroyed., “Even though the communities I work with are facing all kinds of adverse social impacts from this deforestation, whenever I asked them what the worst impact was, they would invariably tell me that ‘oil palm kills the sago’,” says Sophie Chao, an anthropologist from the University of Sydney who has spent a decade living alongside the Marind., “They would almost place the fate of this tree before their own lives … it was the threat to the sago, this nourishing, life-giving plant, that they considered to be the most dramatic rupture caused by deforestation and oil-palm expansion.”, Together with members of the Marind community, Chao co-wrote an extinction story about sago for the Living Archive. It includes a translation of a song sung to the plant by a Marind elder: “From eating sago, we grew bone; from eating sago, we knew home.”, Marind call themselves “sago people”, and the palm entwines with every aspect of their life, Chao says. Children are said to grow best in the company of sago, and particular palms are named after children that came into the world at the same time. Those babies are often carried in bags made from the fronds of their namesake palm so that, as one young mother told Chao, “sago and Marind can follow each other’s lives”., People also talk about being “good food for sago”, Chao says. Palm starch nourishes the Marind through their life; but when a person dies, they must be buried in a sago grove so that their body becomes food for the microorganisms that in turn feed the forest’s roots., Now, conventional palm oil companies clear-cut the groves, and even “sustainable” projects can exclude local people from conservation zones, severing the Marind’s lifelong connection to their kindred sago., “This plant is culturally meaningful, and it is politically meaningful too,” says Chao., “When people are talking about this kind of localised extinction they are also speaking about what they see as their own possible extinction as West Papuan people: the cultural dilution, forced sterilisation, systemic incarceration, and all sorts of other processes that are very much part of the collective identity of West Papuans.”, And yet, the whole point of the Living Archive is to “avoid the politics of despair,” Chao says. As she tells in her extinction story, the Marind themselves have found some hope and resilience in the possibility of reaching a kind of understanding with oil palm: “So we cannot deny ourselves hope when they are finding glimmers amid the rubble!”, There is power in good stories, Chao says. “They might not be able to change the status quo or the structural processes and violence that are causing extinctions, but caring matters. Fleshy stories make us care more.”, And they’re more important now than ever, van Dooren says. Covid19 is seen by many as a product of a dysfunctional relationship between humans and animals, and the broader environment too., “Extinction is only part of that puzzle but it’s a significant part - it’s a symptom of a broader set of problematic relationships that we’re being reminded of, not just by Covid 19, but by climate change., “Storytelling is a big part of how we manage those relationships and how we imagine other possibilities.”, Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featurestales of love and loss people from oceania share their extinction stories aoe", "label": 0}, "train-742": {"text": "\nCountry diary: our new topsoil seethes with history\n, Welburn and Crambeck, North Yorkshire: As I pick out the stones and weeds, I think about the life you can see and the life you can’t, \nAmy-Jane Beer, \n\nSat 25 Apr 2020 00.30 EDT\n\n, I’m not really up for the graft of garden maintenance. Aside from planting a few fruit trees, herbs and pollinator plants, our custodianship is better described as “ungardening”. We’ve welcomed back herb robert and red campion, dandelion and bugle, and the place heaves with birds, rabbits and voles. But in a lockdown-induced fit of horticultural zeal, I recently begged two big old raised beds from our kindly farmer neighbour. After we’d heaved them into position, a digger rumbled down the lane and deposited a half-tonne of local topsoil in one deft dump. That is my kind of gardening., Farmer John warned that I’d have to pick out the stones and weeds, and after shovelling in most of our compost heap I set to – raking with my hands, crushing lumps, rubbing in blobs of clay and manure like butter into scone mix. But no recipe can replicate soil. After three student summers in a “mud-pie” geomechanics laboratory, I can still grade silt from sand by touch, and sort angular gravel from sub-rounded cobble at a glance., I’ll never accept my ex-geologist husband’s mischievous insistence that soil is rock. This stuff is alive. There’s life you can see – earthworms and skinny Geophilus centipedes, fragments of root and shoot – and life you can’t: kilometres of fungal hyphae in every handful, thousands of nematodes, billions of bacteria. But lists, schmists. You could document every physical, chemical and biological property of this substance and still not describe it, because soil seethes with history too., The land adjoining this was once a quarry and most of the fragments I extract are limestone, but there is brick and pot too. Before the quarry, there was a Roman pottery, mass-producing what is now known as Crambeck ware for distribution all over the north of England. John tells me he finds fragments of huge coil pots that look like fossil turds, evidence of much earlier native potters at work in the bronze- and iron-age settlements that were here long before the Romans., In temporarily taming this indescribable amalgam, I’ve sloughed my own biological signature into it, and added those of carrots and beets, beans and borage. In a few months, we’ll eat, and become just a bit more local ourselves.country diary our new topsoil seethes with history", "label": 0}}
