{"train-0": {"text": "\nAustralia bushfires: PM's climate stance criticised as thousands flee blazes\n, Scott Morrison’s government under pressure as fires feared to have killed 17 people, \nBen Smee , \nCalla Wahlquist\nHelen Davidson in Sydney and \nJon Henley, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 14.04 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Wed 1 Jan 2020 13.48 EST\n\n, Navy ships and army aircraft have been dispatched to help fight devastating bushfires on Australia’s south-east coast that are feared to have killed at least 17 people, amid a spiralling debate over the government’s stance on the climate emergency., Thousands of people have fled apocalyptic scenes, abandoning their homes and huddling on beaches to escape raging columns of flame and smoke that have plunged whole towns into darkness and destroyed more than 4m hectares of land., Thousands of firefighters were still battling more than 100 blazes in New South Wales (NSW) state and nearly 40 in Victoria on Wednesday, with new fires being sparked daily by hot and windy conditions and, more recently, dry lightning strikes created by the fires themselves., At the end of Australia’s hottest-ever decade, Canberra, the capital, was blanketed in a cloud of dense smoke that left its air quality more than 21 times the hazardous rating. The haze drifted more than 1,200 miles (2,000km) to the South Island of New Zealand, where it turned the daytime sky orange., Fanned by soaring temperatures, strong winds and a terrible three-year drought, huge blazes have ravaged a tinder-dry landscape, causing immense destruction: since November, more than 900 homes have been lost in NSW alone., With three months of the summer still to go, the early and devastating start to the country’s fire season has led authorities to rate it the worst on record and prompted urgent questions about whether the conservative government of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has taken enough action on global heating., Polls show a large majority of Australians see the climate emergency as an urgent threat and want tougher government action, but Morrison has focused instead on the nation’s response to the bushfire crisis and defending Australian business, while other government officials have publicly disparaged climate activists., In his New Year’s Eve address to the nation, Morrison did not make any connection between the bushfires and global heating, suggesting that while they were a terrible ordeal, Australians had faced similar trials throughout history., Past generations had “also faced natural disasters, floods, fires, global conflicts, disease and drought” and overcome them, the prime minister said in a video message. “That is the spirit of Australians, that is the spirit that is on display, that is a spirit that we can celebrate as Australians.”, On Wednesday, he acknowledged at a reception that the fires were “a time of great challenge for Australia”, but deflected debate about the underlying cause of the fires, concentrating again on the nation’s resilience., Fire experts and scientists have described the scale and impact of this year’s fires as unprecedented and said that greenhouse gas emissions, while they do not cause fires, play a proven role in raising temperatures and creating the exceptionally dry conditions that make the risk of fire extreme or catastrophic., Although slightly cooler conditions on New Year’s Day gave the country a moment to take stock of the devastation, conditions were set to deteriorate again over the weekend, said the NSW state premier, Gladys Berejiklian., Dangerous fire conditions were forecast to return to eastern Victoria and NSW on Saturday, with temperatures again likely to reach the mid-40s. “We are assuming that weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday,” Berejiklian said. “All of us have to brace ourselves.”, While most of the destruction occurred on Tuesday, the ferocity of the fires meant many people were unable to find out basic information until New Year’s Day. Electricity and communications lines were cut for extended periods in many areas. Roads in and out of towns remained closed., Officials in NSW and Victoria said on Wednesday another five people were confirmed dead, and another man was presumed to have been killed. Scores more were missing and the death toll was likely to continue to rise, they said., Three bodies were found on Wednesday at Lake Conjola on the south coast of NSW, bringing the death toll in the state to 15., About 4,000 people in the coastal Victoria town of Mallacoota fled to the shore as winds pushed a fire toward their homes under a sky turned dark by smoke and turned red by flames. Dozens of homes burned before winds changed direction late on Tuesday, sparing the rest of the town., Mark Tregellas, a resident who spent the night on a boat ramp, said only a late shift in the wind direction spared lives. “The fire just continued to grow and then the black started to descend,” he said. “I couldn’t see the hand in front of my face, and then it started to glow red and we knew the fire was coming., “Ash started to fall from the air and then the embers started to come down. At that point, people started to bring their kids and families into the water. Thankfully, the wind changed and the fire moved away.”, The Victoria state premier, Daniel Andrews, said four people remained missing after a massive blaze ripped through Gippsland, a rural region about 310 miles (500km) east of Melbourne., Mick Roberts from East Gippsland had been unaccounted for since Monday and was found dead in his home on Wednesday. “He’s not missing any more … sorry but his body has been found in his house,” his niece, Leah Parsons, said on social media., At Malua Bay, on the NSW south coast, survivors spoke of how 1,000 people spent the night on the beach. “Everyone was on the beach, just covered in ash and smoke,” Al Baxter, a retired rugby union international, told Guardian Australia., “There was a strange calmness. People were as close to the water’s edge as they could be. People were literally just lying on the beach trying to keep out of the smoke and ash.”, Criticism of the Morrison government’s climate stance has intensified as the fires have raged. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas, but the prime minister, who won a surprise election victory in May, last month rejected calls to downsize Australia’s lucrative coal industry., His government has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2030, a modest figure compared with the centre-left opposition Labor party’s pledge of 45%. The leader of the minor Australian Greens party, Richard Di Natale, demanded a royal commission, the nation’s highest form of inquiry, on the crisis., “If he (Morrison) refuses to do so, we will be moving for a parliamentary commission of inquiry with royal commission-like powers as soon as parliament returns,” Di Natale said in a statement., Australia’s armed forces, including helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and naval vessels, were being deployed to help fight the fires, bring water, food and fuel to towns where supplies were depleted and roads cut off, as well as evacuate residents., Victoria’s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said the 176-metre HMAS Choules, due to arrive by Friday, may be used to evacuate many of those stranded in Mallacoota, although its capacity of 1,000 people would not be enough on its own to handle everyone who needed to get out., “It doesn’t have the current capacity for everyone at Mallacoota,” Crisp said. “We are exploring all our options … and certainly to look at evacuating some people from Mallacoota by sea is an option we’re seriously considering.”, Besides the deployment of HMAS Choules, Australia’s defence force said it had been providing support to bushfire efforts in all states except Tasmania since 8 November and was dispatching Taipan, Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters plus two Spartan aircraft to Victoria, where they would help with firefighting efforts and provide humanitarian assistance to isolated communities.australia bushfires defence forces sent to help battle huge blazes", "label": 0}, "train-1": {"text": "Three more deaths confirmed in Australian blazes and hundreds of homes destroyed – as it happened, East Gippsland fires claim homes, and 176 properties lost in New South Wales. This live blog is now closed., \nHelen Davidson (now), \nAmy Remeikis and \nLuke Henriques-Gomes (earlier), \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 03.11 EST\n\n\n\nFirst published on Tue 31 Dec 2019 15.59 EST\n\n\n, \n\n3.07am EST\n03:07\n\n, We are ending this blog for today. , While fires continued to burn today they were not as catastrophic as Tuesday. Instead, we learned a lot about the absolute devastation wrought along the NSW south coast and Victoria’s East Gippsland region., Updated\nat 3.11am EST\n, \n\n3.01am EST\n03:01\n\n, Yep - locals on the ground told @abccanberra Drive this evening that about 50 of 60 homes in North Rosedale are gone. About a third of the homes in South Rosedale. Unconfirmed, but solid local sources. One of the prettiest, loveliest places on earth. So very, very horrible. https://t.co/fL5qn0dKFV, \n\n2.38am EST\n02:38\n\n, There is an active emergency level fire in Western Australia. The warning was issued for parts of Orelia in the city of Kwinana. Homes on Colchester Avenue were under threat from a fire in Sandringham Park which started near the intersection of Colchester Avenue and Dunrobin Avenue and was moving north east., Updated\nat 2.48am EST\n, \n\n2.33am EST\n02:33\n\n, FitzSimmons says the Dunn Road fire is going be upgraded again to an emergency fire as the fire behaviour was increasing and spreading., These fires are in some of NSW’s “most beautiful yet most rugged and difficult-to-access terrain.”, “We’ve seen the enormity of damage and destruction which unfolded yesterday and unfortunately Saturday is likely to be worse.”, \n\n2.31am EST\n02:31\n\n, From the premier, Gladys Berejiklian:, “Just because you can’t see flames doesn’t mean the road is safe to use. Having seen the number of trees burnt out, having seen the bring alongside these roads, I completely understand why the emergency authorities need to make sure they are safe before people can use them. , “Having said that, we are grateful for milder weather conditions over the next few days and where roads can be accessed, we will be encouraging tourists especially to move out of those areas while it’s safe to do so, because we are concerned what the weather might bring us on Saturday, given what has been forecast and given what we’ve experienced over the last few days.”, Updated\nat 2.39am EST\n, \n\n2.30am EST\n02:30\n\n, There is an evening update with the NSW premier and senior fire and police chiefs at the NSW RFS headquarters., “We are getting indications with the forecast for Saturday that it is going to present a broader geographic area worse than what we saw yesterday when it comes to fire danger, with a fairly widespread area of extreme conditions which will dominate the south eastern corner of the state, through the southern slopes, southern ranges, parts of the high country and through to places like the Illawarra and Shoalhaven,” Shane FitzSimmons says., “Unfortunately that also correlates with where we’ve got some of the worst and most damaging and destructive of fires burning in New South Wales at the moment.”, Firefighters are keeping a close eye on the Green wattle Creek fire where it has flared up in the north-east corner. Firefighters are addressing it ahead of the worsening conditions later this week., Access from Batemans Bay north will be open to some very restricted access from this afternoon, says NSW police deputy commissioner Worboys., “Towards south of Batemans Bay, we will also work with some local roads down the coast that will bring people down in through Bega, and across Brown Mountain, into Coomera, Canberra, and they can make their way up towards Goulburn, up the Hume towards Sydney and out further west.”, He says there’s “a long way to go” but they are working to restore power, with some back on in places like Ulladulla and near Batemans Bay. He says everyone has been very patient and he’s grateful., “In our evacuation centres that are full, it is trying times, and people have heeded the warnings, they’ve cooperated well, and we just ask them again to continue in that spirit through tonight, into tomorrow, and we look forward to some further power restoration, some more road openings, and of course increased communications up and down the south coast.”, Updated\nat 2.36am EST\n, \n\n2.16am EST\n02:16\n\n, Two bushfires have merged on South Australia’s Kangaroo Island and are expected to burn for weeks, as firefighters prepare for a dangerous wind change, AAP reports., The fires started about five kilometres apart in the inaccessible Ravine Des Casoars Wilderness Protection Area and have burnt through more than 7500 hectares of native vegetation, timber plantations and private property., On Wednesday afternoon the combined fire was uncontrolled and burning in a northerly direction towards Snug Cove., Firefighters and water-bombing aircraft are focused on protecting assets, but the Country Fire Service said efforts might be hampered by changing weather conditions and poor visibility., If the blaze remains uncontained, northerly winds forecast for Friday could push it towards the Flinders Chase National Park., For the safety of tourists and the community, the CFS and SA National Parks and Wildlife Service have closed the park from midnight Wednesday until further notice. Extensive road closures are also in place on the western end of the island., The CFS has confirmed the Cudlee Creek fire, which broke out on December 20 and destroyed at least 70 homes, has been contained., \n\n2.05am EST\n02:05\n\n, The Dunns Road fire has been downgraded to a watch and act, which means there are currently no emergency level fires or warnings in NSW or Victoria. Having said that, the ABC has just reported the Currowan fire has jumped the Shoalhaven river in spots, which is not great news for people around Wingello, Penrose and Bundanoon., The RFS last provided an update on that fire a few hours ago, so I’ll bring more info when we have it., Updated\nat 2.10am EST\n, \n\n1.59am EST\n01:59\n\n, Shane Kelly has sent in these photos, taken somewhere east of Canberra., I work for an airline and have been flying in and around this smoke for a while now, it’s absolutely devastating to have this overview of these fires. You feel helpless. The enormity of the fires really impresses on you when you can see the extent of the fires from the air flying up and down the east coast of Australia., Guardian Australia would like to hear from you about your encounter with the fires in this summer’s unprecedented fire season. If you would like to get in contact with us, details are here., Updated\nat 2.03am EST\n, \n\n1.49am EST\n01:49\n\n, Further details from NSW police about the seven confirmed deaths in the southern NSW fires., Since Monday, emergency services have responded to the following fatal incidents:, A 72-year-old man at Belowra and a 70-year-old woman at Conjola Park are still both unaccounted for., Updated\nat 1.56am EST\n, \n\n1.40am EST\n01:40\n\n, This particularly grim video shows the level of destruction to a line of shops in Mogo, on the NSW south coast., \n\n1.31am EST\n01:31\n\n, Good afternoon. This is Helen Davidson here to take you through the rest of the day’s live coverage of the continuing Australian bushfire crisis., In NSW there is one emergency-level fire in the Snowy Valleys. The Dunns Road fire has burned more than 100,000 hectares. Conditions are easing but it is burning south of the Snowy Mountains Highway in the Ellerslie Range, and the south-westerly change is pushing the fire towards the areas of Kunama, Wondalga and surrounds. People there are urged to leave now towards Tumut if they aren’t prepared., There are six watch and act fires in the state, all in the south., In Tasmania there is one emergency warning for a fire in the north-east at Fingal through to Mathinna. The alert was issued about two hours ago and warned of high risk to the area, with the fire difficult to control. People north of Moonameeta were urged to evacuate to Mathinna. There are six other watch and act alerts, mainly in the north-east but also one north-west of Hobart., In Victoria there are currently no emergency warnings, as the Sunbury fire has been downgraded. There are 11 watch and act warnings issued. , There is one watch and act fire in South Australia, on Kangaroo Island., Updated\nat 1.51am EST\n, \n\n1.11am EST\n01:11\n\n, And there are months to go., Today we had both NSW and Victoria’s emergency chiefs tell us they could not get around these fires. That 10,000 firefighters on the ground would not be enough to stop the blazes., All that is going to help is a change in conditions, but instead we are facing Saturday being worse than what we saw on Tuesday., And there are months to go in this season. MONTHS., On that dour note, I am going to hand you over to Helen Davidson for the evening coverage., Stay safe and pay attention to the warnings in your area.

They warned the death toll was likely to continue to rise., At Malua Bay, on the NSW south coast, survivors spoke of how 1,000 people spent the night on the beach in a bid to seek shelter from the flames. “Everyone was on the beach, just covered in ash and smoke,” Al Baxter, the former Wallaby, told Guardian Australia. “There was a strange calmness. People were as close to the water’s edge as they could be. People were literally just lying on the beach trying to keep out of the smoke and ash., In Victoria, Mick Roberts from Buchan in the East Gippsland region had been unaccounted for since Monday. He was found dead in his home on Wednesday., “He’s not missing any more ... sorry but his body has been found in his house,” Roberts’s niece Leah Parsons said on social media. “Very sad day for us to (start) the year but we’re a bloody tight family and we will never forget our mate and my beautiful Uncle Mick,” she wrote., In NSW, police have now confirmed deaths at Lake Conjola, Yatte Yattah, Sussex Inlet and Coolagolite. Authorities been unable to reach a property at Belowra in NSW where a 72-year-old man is presumed dead., As relatively calm conditions set in on Wednesday, the sheer scale of the fire emergency was laid bare. People returned to find their homes damaged or destroyed. Thick smoke was visible more than 2,000km away, on the south island of New Zealand., In Christchurch... the smoke from NSW and Victoria has made its way here. I just wish it would rain across the whole of Australia and put them all out! That was the sun at 3pm!! #AustraliaFires #bushfirecrisis pic.twitter.com/BGJDkapk35, Authorities confirmed 176 homes have been lost on the NSW south coast; 89 in Conjola Park, 40 at Malua Bay and 15 in Rosedale. Another 50 properties have been destroyed in Victoria since Sunday. It is expected the final figures may be much higher., Here it is. Our family home. Burnt to the ground. Photos taken by our neighbour. We are devastated. Just one of the many, many homes lost in Batemans Bay and Mogo. #NSWfires pic.twitter.com/ob5Ub3YZMr, The small inland communities of Cobargo, Quaama and Mogo in NSW were severely affected by the fires., Absolute devastation in Cobargo. Many thought their homes would be ok. @10NewsFirstSyd pic.twitter.com/EuryrloyK8, While most of the destruction occurred on Tuesday, the ferocity of the fires meant many people were unable to find out basic information until New Year’s Day. Electricity and communications lines were cut for extended periods in many areas. Roads in and out of towns remain closed., The disaster has brought out stories of community and efforts to battle on in the face of unprecedented adversity in Victoria and NSW. In Bairnsdale, donations flooded in for those who had lost everything, who even then were reluctant to accept help., “We had a couple with three kids here, and he the father started crying,” said helper Wendy McPhan. “I said, ‘here’s a $300 voucher for Woolies,’ and he said ‘no, I can’t take that, there’s people worse off.’, “I said: ‘Mate, you have lost everything. You have lost your house. There is no one worse off.’”, Many people are now concerned they might not be able to escape affected areas for days; a fear compounded by forecasts that the calm weather on Wednesday is but a brief reprieve. , Forecasters predict very hot and windy conditions for South Australia on Friday and dangerous bushfire conditions for eastern Victoria and New South Wales on Saturday, with temperatures again set to reach into the mid-40s., “We are assuming that on Saturday weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday,” the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said. “That is something all of us have to brace ourselves for.”, The likelihood of extreme conditions returning has added to the urgency to assist people who remain hemmed in by closed roads and uncontrolled firegrounds., The Australian Defence Force has been deployed to attempt to evacuate residents from isolated communities by air or sea, and drop off supplies. A ship with supplies for two weeks – 1.6 tonnes of water, food, and 30,000 litres of fuel – has already left Melbourne., Victorian premier Daniel Andrews, on a visit to Bairnsdale on Wednesday, said: “I don’t know that we’ve ever done this before … we’ve got choppers taking 90 firefighters out of the Mallacoota area, they can’t be removed any other way – we’re essentially doing a shift change by the air.”, The three major fires in Victoria’s East Gippsland region now cover about 500,000 hectares and have “essentially combined into one”, state emergency services commissioner Andrew Crisp said. A 100,000ha fire at Corryong, on the northern side of the Great Dividing Range, and another fire of a similar size in NSW, are also at risk of combining., Crisp said it would not be possible to put out those fires before the weather worsened. “It was nature which started the fires and it will be nature that stops these fires,” he said., On Wednesday afternoon two fires burning on Kangaroo Island in South Australia merged, and firefighters have warned it could burn for weeks. Forecast northerly winds could push the fire towards the Flinders Chase national park., Since the start of July, 15 people have been killed by the bushfires and more than 1,000 homes lost., Firefighter Sam McPaul, 28, died when his fire truck was overturned by extreme winds east of Albury on Monday., Father and son, Robert and Patrick Salway, were found dead inside their house in Cobargo on Tuesday., The nature and scale of this bushfire season in Australia is unprecedented. Scientists have cited the lack of moisture in the landscape – following years of drought – as a key reason the fires have been so severe. Intense heat, dry conditions and strong winds have created conditions where the fire risk is considered extreme or catastrophic., The prime minister, Scott Morrison, at a reception for the Australian and New Zealand cricket sides at Kirribilli House, acknowledged the fires were “a time of great challenge for Australia”. Morrison reiterated comments from a New Year comment piece that focused on the resilience of communities and deflected debate about the underlying cause of the fires., “Whether they’re started by lightning storms or whatever the cause may be, our firefighters and all of those who have come behind them to support them, whether they’re volunteering in the front line or behind the scenes in a great volunteer effort, it is something that will happen against the backdrop of this Test match., “But at the same time, Australians will be gathering, whether it’s at the SCG Sydney cricket ground or around television sets all around the country, and they’ll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think they’ll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians and the way that people have gone about remembering the terrible things that other Australians are dealing with at the moment.”australia fires nine dead and hundreds of properties destroyed with worse to come", "label": 0}, "train-3": {"text": "\nNew year's disaster: full horror of Australia's bushfires begins to emerge – in pictures\n, New year's disaster: full horror of Australia's bushfires begins to emerge – in pictures, Australia’s south-east devastated by fires that have left nine people dead and hundreds of homes destroyed since Christmas, • Australia’s bushfire towns battle on, despite what they have lost: supplies, power, houses, ‘the lot’, , \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 02.44 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Jan 2020 16.58 EST\n\n, Photograph: Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty Images, Photograph: Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian, Photograph: Sean Davey/AAP, Photograph: Emergency services fight the fires in East Gippsland, 31 December 2019., Photograph: Emergency services fight the fires in East Gippsland, 31 December 2019., Photograph: Jason Edwards/Pool/News Corp Australia, Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian, Photograph: Jason Edwards/Pool/News Corp Australianew years disaster full horror of australias bushfires begins to emerge in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-4": {"text": "\nAustralia's bushfire towns battle on, despite what they have lost: supplies, power, houses, 'the lot'\n, Evacuees and residents in Victoria band together to help one another, while cut-off NSW communities struggle to reconnect to the world outside , \nCalla Wahlquist, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 01.37 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 20.08 EST\n\n, Donations began arriving at Lucknow Memorial Hall, on the outskirts of Bairnsdale, at 1pm on Tuesday. Within 24 hours a second donation point had been set up at Lucknow primary school, because the hall was full., Clothes are stacked on three trestle tables in the centre of the hall, blankets are lined up on the floor, and food – staples such as cereal and long-life milk – are against one long wall., “This is all social media,” Wendy McPhan says. She made a Facebook post on Tuesday inquiring if there was anything she could do locally to help victims of the devastating bushfires, that have destroyed more than 200 homes and are still burning out of control in East Gippsland and southern NSW. Suddenly she had donations arriving from Melbourne, 280km away., On the heels of the donations came those who had lost everything, but were reluctant to say they needed help. People are proud in Gippsland, McPhan says., “We had a couple with three kids here, and he the father started crying,” she says. “I said, ‘here’s a $300 voucher for Woolies,’ and he said ‘no, I can’t take that, there’s people worse off.’, “I said: ‘Mate, you have lost everything. You have lost your house. There is no one worse off.’”, The vouchers and cash donations go into McPhan’s handbag, to be distributed to those worst affected. While we speak, a woman walks over and hands her a $50 supermarket voucher, with another to be given directly to a woman who is gently weeping on the shoulder of one of the volunteers., “I might be back on Saturday to get it back,” the woman with the voucher says. “I am at Sarsfield – we might lose the lot.”, The Barmouth Spur fire is only 10km north of the hall, at Mount Taylor and Sarsfield. Nineteen structures, including about a dozen houses, have been confirmed destroyed at Sarsfield., With hot conditions and a northerly wind forecast again for Saturday, the donation centre may have to move., Many of those who have lost everything are single men who are reluctant to accept the assistance they desperately need., A man whose house burned down at Buchan South arrived at the hall and quietly told a volunteer that no one had come looking for him. He accepted a hug and some food while helping to carry boxes: for those reluctant to seek help, it is easier to be able to give help at the same time., Volunteers are gently ensuring that everyone who accesses the donated goods also registers with emergency services. Local MP Tim Bull has promised to organise a truck to send donations 230km east to Mallacoota as soon as the Princes Highway is opened., That is expected to take days. The Australian Defence Force has been deployed to attempt to evacuate residents from isolated communities by air or sea, and drop off supplies. A ship with supplies for two weeks – 1.6 tonnes of water, food, and 30,000 litres of fuel – has already left Melbourne., Further up the east coast, in New South Wales, locals and tourists are queuing for the supermarket to get basic supplies, and queuing for a payphone that, before the mobile phone towers ran out of both power and batteries, many would have considered obsolete., At Moruya, the IGA had to be barricaded to prevent people from looting., The supermarket in Narooma has been able to open thanks to a generator loaned from the fish shop.

Many who wish to leave do not have enough in the tank to reach the next petrol station, and to drive in an area with active bushfires without a full tank is to risk getting stuck in an inferno., At Batemans Bay, petrol stations on the Princes Highway are either closed, or only accepting cash, because EFTPOS machines are down. But some ATMs are also down, making it impossible to get cash., People in some parts of the South Coast so completely cut off. No power, no internet, no phone service, no shops open. Massive diesel shortage, other fuel is scarce. Smoke cloaking the landscape. Fire reached the sand dunes here in Broulee. pic.twitter.com/xzIWnyMX7n, Power remains cut to much of East Gippland and the far south coast of NSW. Gippsland Water were working on Tuesday to restore generator power to ensure the water would come back on, but the work is slow and made slower by the constant use of sprinklers by those still under direct fire threat., At Cann River, 50km west of Mallacoota, about 100 people are sheltering in the school and awaiting the arrival of a fire burning towards them from Goongerah. Local businesses are providing food for everyone, a Cann River local told the ABC, and they are all sharing water, but both electricity and mobile phone signal are patchy. They are cut off, as is the town of Buchan., A fire that started east of Cann River burned through Mallacoota on Tuesday night, destroying dozens of houses and leaving that town cut off as well., At Lake Tyers, an Aboriginal community about 25 minutes drive east of Lakes Entrance, the water ran out at 11am., Charmaine Sellings, who is both a paramedic and fire chief for the Gunai/Kurnai community, says she will have to fill the slip-on fire fighting unit from her daughter’s pool before the northerly wind and high temperatures return on Saturday., That small firefighting tank, which sits on the back of her ute, is the only appliance to protect a community of more than 40 people, many of whom are elderly and have respiratory problems., “At the moment there’s a few houses out there without electricity, and as you can see we have just run out of water in the tanks,” Sellings says. “I am getting no information – the last visitor we had with fire information was on Sunday.”, Outside the community health centre, which has become the evacuation centre, a trailer full of canoes stands ready should the fire, which reached Nowa Nowa, 12km due north through thick and “very dry” forest, reach the edge of the oval on Saturday., “We have got the boats out because we can accommodate at least 20 people, with 20 life jackets, if we have to get to the water,” community member Kerry Tregonning says.australia bushfire towns supplies power houses the lot", "label": 0}, "train-5": {"text": "Australian navy ship prepares to evacuate residents from bushfire-hit Victoria coast, HMAS Choules leaves Sydney Harbour headed to the devastated coastal town of Mallacoota, The Australian Defence Force will deploy a massive navy supply ship designed to deal with humanitarian crises to eastern Victoria and the NSW south coast as authorities struggle with the devastating bushfires in both states., Emergency services officials in Victoria said they may use that vessel, the 176-metre-long HMAS Choules, to evacuate residents who have been left stranded at the coastal town of Mallacoota after a large blaze forced 4,000 people to take shelter on the foreshore. It is due to arrive by Friday., Residents and visitors in Mallacoota, an inlet close to the NSW border, awoke to a scene of devastation on Wednesday, and some have reportedly been forced to sleep in their cars or public buildings. They have reported running low on food and water., At a media conference on Wednesday, Victoria’s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said authorities were considering an evacuation by sea and would prioritise those in most need., “It doesn’t have the current capacity for everyone at Mallacoota,” he said. “My understanding it has a capacity of 1,000 people. If we were to do that, we would be prioritising those., “We are exploring all our options … and certainly to look at evacuating some people from Mallacoota by sea is an option we’re seriously considering.”, On Tuesday the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, revealed the state had requested assistance from the military and on Wednesday the defence force outlined its plans.

Although not dropping water on fires at night, that will give us a great intelligence capability overnight.”, Fire crews remained concerned that a blaze at Corryong in north-east Victoria would merge with other fires on the NSW border., More than 7,000 homes across East Gippsland and 1,800 in the north-east of the state were without power and many were without phone coverage on Wednesday afternoon. It may take days to restore electricity to these communities., Residents in Mallacoota were told to boil their water to reduce public health risks., In NSW, the deputy police commissioner, Gary Worboys, said on Wednesday defence had been assisting state authorities for some time, including by providing military aircraft when local equipment was required., “It’s a simple process of crews putting an application in to myself,” he said. “I haven’t knocked back one yet.”, Victorian police have been using boats to ferry water, food and other supplies to those isolated in Mallacoota., Andrews said on Wednesday the state had also taken the unprecedented step of using its own fleet of helicopters to transport fire crews in and out of the isolated areas., “We’ve got choppers taking 90 firefighters out of the Mallacoota area, they can’t be removed any other way – we’re essentially doing a shift change by the air,” he said.australian navy ship prepares to evacuate residents from bushfire hit victoria coast", "label": 0}, "train-6": {"text": "\nMalua Bay fire: survivors tell how 1,000 people lived through a night of flames on NSW beach\n, The whole town crowded on to the beach on the NSW south coast ‘trying to keep out of the smoke and ash’ , \nBen Smee, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 20.08 EST\n\n, The beach at Malua Bay is shadowed at both ends by headlands.

Intense heat, dry conditions and strong winds have created conditions where the fire risk is considered extreme or catastrophic., While increasing greenhouse gas emissions do not directly cause bushfires, evidence shows they play a role in increasing average and extreme temperatures, which in turn contribute to the extraordinarily dry conditions.malua bay fire survivors tell how 1000 people lived through a night of flames on nsw beach", "label": 0}, "train-7": {"text": "\nVictorian bushfires: devastation left in the wake of the East Gippsland fire – video\n, Footage taken driving through the burnt properties and bushland around Bairnsdale in Victoria shows the devastating result of a fire that has ripped through more than 200,000 hectares in East Gippsland since Monday• NSW and Victoria fires live: three more deaths confirmed in Australia bushfires and hundreds of homes destroyed, Source: Georgie Moore/AAP, \n\nTue 31 Dec 2019 23.19 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Jan 2020 04.41 EST\n\nvictorian bushfires devastation left in the wake of the east gippsland fire video", "label": 0}, "train-8": {"text": "\nAustralia weather forecast: dangerous bushfire and heatwave conditions to return after brief cool reprieve\n, Temperatures in Victoria expected to reach mid-40s bringing elevated fire conditions in the state and NSW and South Australia, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nTue 31 Dec 2019 21.59 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 31 Dec 2019 22.11 EST\n\n, Firefighters and communities devastated by an unprecedented bushfire season can expect a brief reprieve from severe weather conditions before a return of the heat on Friday, the Bureau of Meteorology has said. , Forecasters predict very hot and windy conditions for South Australia on Friday and dangerous bushfire conditions for eastern Victoria and New South Wales on Saturday, with temperatures again reaching into the mid-40s., “We are assuming that on Saturday weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. “That is something all of us have to brace ourselves for.”, Patchy showers and thunderstorms are expected with a cold front through Western Australia on Saturday, moving across into Victoria and South Australia on Sunday, reaching NSW late on Sunday or early Monday., But Jonathan How, a forecaster at the bureau, told Guardian Australia it was uncertain if any significant rain would reach bushfire areas., He said: “We could see some widespread showers and thunderstorms through the south-east of the country, but it’s going to be patchy and it’s uncertain whether it gets to those fire sites.”, How said Wednesday was much cooler across the south-east after a run of hot days, bringing brief relief for Tasmania, Victoria and NSW., “From tomorrow, we start to see the heat build again from southern parts of WA and South Australia., “Friday is a very hot day across South Australia and Victoria with Adelaide getting up to 42C on Friday.

Morrison had a regular Monday spot on Hadley’s show until April 2017, when the two fell out. But they patched it up in 2018 soon after Morrison got the top job., Guardian Australia requested correspondence between Hadley and federal and NSW ministers under freedom of information laws., The prime minister finally replied to the Guardian’s request on Christmas Eve and produced one letter written in July, in which he pushed back on criticism about the raids on journalists by the Australian Federal Police., Whether this letter was sent to Hadley or Jones is unclear – the recipient was redacted – but it was more likely to be Jones, as he has been a critic on-air of the AFP actions., Indeed, Jones was so incensed he emailed Morrison about it while he was overseas in June . Within half an hour a reply arrived direct from Morrison. These emails were not produced as a result of the Guardian’s freedom of information request, but Jones read most of it on air at the time., It is likely there was more correspondence with both broadcasters, but the prime minister’s office invoked s4 of the Freedom of Information Act, which says only correspondence relating to the minister’s duties must be released., Another of 2GB’s regulars, the New South Wales Nationals leader, John Barilaro, did produce documents in response to the information request, which give an insight into how politics is played in NSW, and the way high-profile broadcasters are roped into campaigns., On 6 August, Barilaro’s media adviser received an email from Hadley headed: “Adam Marshall doing the bidding of the Animal Justice Party.”, “Mate, ask barra what sort of lunacy this is,” Hadley wrote., Copy and pasted into the email were three paragraphs from the Shooters and Fishers complaining about the agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, (also a National), who had asked the chair of a committee – a Shooters party MP – for a parliamentary inquiry into the exhibition of circus animals and dolphins and whales in NSW., This was an unusual request from a National and had a whiff of a deal with the Animal Justice party., Because the NSW government does not have a majority in the upper house, it must win over one of the minor parties to get legislation passed. It must deal either with the Shooters or Animal Justice. Shrewdly it cultivates both. But it’s not always easy., Emma Hurst of Animal Justice explained that the party had been seeking an investment from the government in a sea enclosure at Coffs Harbour dolphin marine park, the only place that exhibits dolphins in NSW., “We want the government to invest in sea pen facilities for retired animals and they said they would first need an inquiry,” Hurst said. “The wellbeing of circus animals was tacked on.”, The Shooters were horrified by Marshall’s request and forwarded the correspondence to Hadley, who then sent it to Barilaro with a “please explain”., “Ms Hurst one of two Animal Justice party MPs in NSW’s legislative council is the deputy chair of the committee and given the close working relationship your government appears to be trying to cultivate with the Animal Justice party in this parliament, she may be willing to move this inquiry on your behalf, or on behalf of this government, though I would not be in a position to support such an inquiry,” the committee chairman, Mark Banasiak, a Shooter, wrote back to Marshall., “Furthermore this proposal would have a natural and detrimental flow-on effect throughout rural and regional NSW, and will ultimately lead to the banning of rodeos and animal exhibitions at country shows around the state. It would also place at risk the world renowned Sydney Easter show.”, The next day Hadley was on air interviewing Banasiak, while making no bones about what he thought of Marshall., “Of all the people that have been ministers in NSW parliaments since Federation, this bloke is the biggest joke of all time, Adam Marshall,” Hadley said on 2GB. “There have been some dopes in cabinet and ministry. I think he is on the podium as a gold medal winner when it comes to dopes., “This will be the thin end of the wedge and that’s what the Nationals need to understand, once they get in bed with the Animal Justice party they’ll catch some fleas.”, Barilaro then texted Hadley, who read out the message on air, minus colourful adjectives. , There is no love lost between Barilaro and Marshall. The bad blood goes back to when Barilaro was seeking the leadership and Marshall was in another camp., Barilaro’s response to Hadley remains a mystery., Questioned about the missing correspondence, Barilaro’s staff said the minister routinely deleted messages and emails from his phone after reading them., Sadly, the SMS to Hadley was one of the documents Barilaro deleted., From what Hadley read out, Barilaro sought to convince him that the inquiry would be limited and cover only exotic circus animals and dolphin shows., The letters quickly found their way to the Daily Telegraph, which piled on with the mockery of Marshall., But despite Hadley’s criticism, the inquiry has gone ahead and will hold hearings in 2020. It has received several hundred submissions. Whether it leads to changes in the law or the investment in a sea enclosure being sought by the Animal Justice party remains to be seen., Hurst insisted there had been no horse trading on other legislation.what ray hadleys emails reveal about the nsw nationals dolphins and the circus", "label": 0}, "train-11": {"text": "\nAustralian bushfire crisis predicted to cost tourism industry hundreds of millions\n, Almost 4,300 insurance claims totalling $297m have been lodged since main fires began, but the bill is set to climb, \nBen Butler and \nCalla Wahlquist, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Jan 2020 19.54 EST\n\n,  The deadly bushfires engulfing Australia’s eastern coast will cost the tourism industry hundreds of millions of dollars, operators say., Images of fire and smoke making front pages around the world risked further damaging the industry by scaring away international visitors, the Australian Tourism Industry Council said., Almost 4,300 insurance claims totalling $297m have been lodged since the main fires began on 8 November, but the bill is set to climb as the full extent of damage is uncovered and more country burns over what is expected to be a dangerously hot weekend., The fires have devastated some of Australia’s key tourism areas, including East Gippsland in Victoria and the New South Wales south coast., On Sunday, Victoria’s Country Fire Authority ordered the evacuation of East Gippsland, which is visited by tens of thousands of tourists every summer. On Thursday the naval vessel HMAS Choules was off the coast of Victoria waiting to evacuate some of the 4,000 people trapped in Mallacoota, unable to leave because roads from the town have been cut off., In NSW, the fires have devastated tourist towns including Batemans Bay and Mogo, destroying hundreds of houses and businesses., On Wednesday, Fire and Rescue NSW also ordered people to evacuate the Kosciuszko national park, including the Thredbo resort, which operator Event Hospitality &amp; Entertainment said would be “closed until further notice”., The tourism council executive director, Simon Westaway, said the first priority of tourism operators was to help their local communities, but there was “an unquestionable mounting impact on tourism from these fires”., “The summer school holiday period is the high peak season for many of our regional and rural tourism hotspots,” he said. “It is still too early to fully know and assess the commercial impact but it will clearly run into hundreds of millions of dollars over the near term.”, He said the bushfires were getting heavy coverage overseas and he was concerned visitors might be scared off., “Atic is calling on our government tourism authorities to remain vigilant and be nimble and coordinated to any perceived or real impact to future travel or a decision to defer visiting our country for fear of not being open and accessible, or what these fires may be doing to our pristine nature,” he said., “Our industry is terribly resilient but the severity and scale of these fires and their literal strong global reporting and physical impact can’t be ignored over the ensuing period.”, Some tourists whose holidays were cut short due to bushfires in East Gippsland have pledged to return., Nick Wright and his family have been travelling from their home in Greensborough in Melbourne to spend Christmas at Lake Tyers beach for 22 years. They spent the night with 550 other tourists in a relief centre at nearby Lakes Entrance on Monday, when fire burned south toward the coast, but returned to Lake Tyers for four more days. They planned to leave on Friday, but Wright said they would be back., “We want to support the area by coming back,” Wright said., On Thursday, the Insurance Council of Australia said that since 8 November it had declared a catastrophe in 236 postcodes across four states, including areas on the east coast stretching from East Gippsland to the Gold Coast., The insurance catastrophe declared postcodes across Australia right now. #nswfires #vicfires pic.twitter.com/3REJVazjHt, The ICA said 4,299 claims worth about $297m had been lodged, with 1,485 properties destroyed, but “these loss numbers are expected to increase as further assessments are undertaken”., Economist Saul Eslake said bushfire damage would not be properly reflected in economic statistics, which “can give a distorted impression of the impact of natural disasters”., “The losses – houses burned to the ground – don’t show up, the rebuilding does,” he said. “Disasters can, perversely enough, provide a small boost to growth.”, But he said the statistics would capture the damage to industries including tourism and agriculture., “The loss of productivity of that will show up as a negative in national accounts,” he said. “If livestock is destroyed, that’s beef production that won’t have occurred, or that’s sheep production that won’t have occurred.”, He said the impact on the whole of Australia’s economy was likely to be “quite small”, pointing out that the long-running drought has cut just 0.2% from the country’s gross domestic product., The scale of the disaster is also likely to have a drastic effect on insurance premiums., The operator of the Reef casino in Cairns said disaster insurance had already become more expensive., Reef Casino Trust told the stock exchange its insurer reduced its coverage against cyclones, floods and tidal waves and increased its annual premium by $487,000, to $1.3m., “Challenging market conditions in the insurance industry have led to reductions in the insurance coverage available on commercially reasonable terms for certain risks and an increase in premium costs,” executive director Allan Tan said.australian bushfire crisis predicted to cost tourism industry hundreds of millions", "label": 0}, "train-12": {"text": "\nDear Michael McCormack: a message from the heart of the bushfires\n, Wagga Wagga councillor Vanessa Keenan posted a letter to the deputy prime minister, her local MP, on Facebook after surviving the NSW bushfires.

David Bowman, director of the Fire Centre at the University of Tasmania, nailed it when he said: “You can’t properly run an economy when you get a third to a half of the population affected by smoke, and the media completely focused on fires” (Yes, Australia has always had bushfires: but 2019 is like nothing we’ve seen before, 25 December)., Nor can you properly run an economy when your infrastructure keeps getting blown down or washed away. Or when you have major cities like Miami permanently underwater. Or when mass starvation roams the globe following continued crop failures. Or when there are hundreds of millions of people on the move, just looking for some fresh water to drink., These are the realities of a global temperature rise of more than 1.5 degrees celsius., The climate problem is an economic problem, caused by our outdated assumption that nature is infinite. If we are to have any chance of retaining a recognisable world we need to start charging people for the environmental damage that they cause. And use that money to create jobs for people to put it right again.Harold ForbesWareham, Dorset, • Reading Jonathan Watts’ article (The environment in 2050: flooded cities, forced migration – and the Amazon turning to savannah, 30 December), while Australia burns, was depressing – but it should not be ignored., I have just read a summary of John Ruskin’s book The Storm Cloud of the Nineteenth Century (1884). He warned of the environmental pollution that threatened nature with black skies, grimy landscapes and eroded glaciers. He thought it was a reflection of a society that placed money over humanity and nature., This was ignored then; perhaps now we will take note.Jane KellyNorth Stoke, Oxfordshire, • After weeks of articles by raging Australians, now the rage of a visiting scientist to our beautiful shores, with no political axe to grind, just utter disbelief (Australia, your country is burning – dangerous climate change is here with you now, 2 January)., I last spoke to my closest friend Susan, who lives on the South Coast between Nowra and Ulladulla, on New Year’s Eve, just before communications went down. In one of her last comments she expressed her belief that Morrison, the only person living in a “bubble”, the only “quiet” Australian, hellbent on believing in his own infallibility as a messiah to our “heathen” land, would be ousted this year., But who then? Dutton, Frydenberg, Cash, Ley, Taylor? The appalling list goes on and on. There’s no Malcolm Turnbull in the wings this time. Even he proved to be a false dawn, deciding to put position and party before country and his own beliefs. Why didn’t he reach across the political divide to rout the factional hard right?, However, the release of government papers reveals that the Liberal party view on climate change, now a climate emergency, is not just that of a few: it runs long and deep in the party. As if to emphasise the point, on 1 January Jessica Rudd tweeted, “Is now the right time to share that when we moved into the Lodge in 2007, the sole remaining disc in the DVD player was The Great Global Warming Swindle?”, I fear, deeply fear, that 18 May 2019 will go down in history as Australia’s “what if?”. On 13 December 2000, more than a month after the US presidential election, in a world bemused by hanging chads and judicial challenges, Al Gore – with more than half the popular vote – conceded defeat to GW Bush. The world gave a collective sigh, and for the past 20 years has wondered “what if?”. I wonder if we’ll still be here in another 20 to find out the answer.Shirley PearsonAshfield, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, • Imagine this – that we can have the good sense to respect and honour the people who have lost their lives and those seriously injured to the recent and current extreme fires Australia-wide. Many have lost their homes and livelihoods, with livestock either killed or euthanised ; there has been extensive devastation of flora and fauna, some in areas that have previously been too wet to burn. We think of all the women and men in our emergency services putting their lives on the line for this unprecedented catastrophe where there has also been tragic loss of lives, and injuries. There are innumerable volunteers and communities who are extending essential and courageous work for those in dire need, who show tireless compassion, sensitivity and ground work in their support., We read, watch and listen as this devastation continues to unfold. Bravo to them, we say, and praise the Aussie goodwill in adversity. That is not enough. Imagine, in our honour, respect and sorrow, that we as a whole nation do something significant. One thing we could do is to stand in solidarity and insist that we do not have fireworks on New Year’s Eve (Sydney New Year’s Eve fireworks will go ahead despite deputy premier’s call to cancel event, 30 December). This is the time of the year when heatwaves affect us all, when the threat of fires is prominent. Emergency services are already stretched – why waste their time and resources making sure the crowds gathered to watch fireworks are safe, or having to extinguish fires caused by the fireworks (as happened in Adelaide this year)., There are numerous global issues we are asked to and must pay attention to. This is about one night in the year. Instead of seeking worldwide accolades for our famous fireworks, let the world see we are, by this one act, in solidarity during these critical events., Imagine…Maggie KitselaarBelair, Adelaide, South Australia, • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com, • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters, • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

You’re an idiot.”, “Go on, piss off.”, “You’re not welcome.”, One woman, leading a goat, said Mr Morrison controlled the funding and her community had been forgotten., “This is not fair. We are totally forgotten down here,” she said,, “Every single time this area gets a flood or a fire we get nothing., “If we lived in Sydney or on the North Coast we would be flooded with donations and emergency relief.”, Further footage showed the prime minister approaching a firefighter and offering his hand, which is not accepted., “I don’t really want to shake your hand,” the firefighter says.

The numbers fleeing the bushfire crisis remain unclear, but are expected to compare to the 60,000 people who were flown out of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy in 1974., Visitors told to flee a vast evacuation area along the NSW south coast reported sitting in gridlock for up to 10 hours after responding to the order to evacuate, as further outbreaks of fire and sheer weight of traffic blocked escape routes north of Ulladulla and near Cooma in the Snowy Mountains., The prime minister, Scott Morrison, urged people to be patient, as he again deflected criticism about his government’s policies to address the causes of climate change., “I know you can have kids in the car and there is anxiety and there is stress and the traffic is not moving quickly but the best thing to do – the best thing that helps those out there volunteering, out there trying to restore some order to these situations, is for everyone to be patient,” Morrison said., On Thursday afternoon an angry protester told Morrison he should be “ashamed of himself” and that he had “left the country to burn” during a tour of the burnt out town of Cobargo., Authorities in Victoria hold grave fears for 17 people missing across the state, and advised anyone who could do so to leave fire-affected places in the East Gippsland region., The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. , The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk., Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. , Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past., The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970., Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists., NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work., At the Victorian coastal inlet of Mallacoota, which is among 20 towns that have been isolated by the fires since Tuesday, between 3,000 and 4,000 people were facing an impending food and water shortage as they waited to be evacuated by sea., On Thursday afternoon, Australian defence force officials said they expected to relocate 800 people using the naval ship HMAS Choules, while others will be airlifted out., Evacuation plans for #Mallacoota are underway, as #YourADF works with emergency services to prepare transferring people to HMAS Choules tomorrow AM. Commanding Officer of Choules, CMDR Houlihan, led the ADF team onshore today to provide timely and relevant support. pic.twitter.com/ecphjfLg9f, New South Wales has declared a seven-day state of emergency before extreme conditions, including temperatures exceeding 40C, return to the south coast, Snowy Mountains and the outskirts of Sydney on Friday and Saturday., Evacuation orders were issued to holidaymakers from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border and people were advised that two highway escape routes were opened – north to Sydney along the Princes Highway, and south, via the Monaro Highway, hooking back to Canberra through Cooma. But on Thursday evening both routes were at a standstill as the fire threat lingered, with tailbacks of up to 25km reported., The northern route was blocked from about midday by a bushfire that closed the Princes Highway. Motorists heading north were advised to delay their trip or take shelter at Ulladulla. The road remained closed about 6pm. Motorists were reported abandoning their cars or heading to the south., Gridlock all the way through Ulladulla, similar scenes in Milton, Nowra and Batemans Bay.

The declaration was valid for seven days. A second state of emergency was called for a week beginning on 19 December, with the premier’s office citing “the most devastating bushfire season in living memory”. On 2 January, the premier called yet another state of emergency – the third for this fire season – to begin on Friday., So what governs the decision to call a state of emergency, and what powers does the state premier assume in calling one?, State emergency legislation varies from state to state. In NSW, a state of emergency is declared under the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act of 1989 and can be done so when the premier believes there is “a significant and widespread danger to life or property in New South Wales”., The declaration triggers a broad range of measures. On Thursday, Berejiklian drew attention to the powers that the declaration gives emergency services to close and open roads at will, and forcibly evacuate members of the public, citing extreme high temperatures forecast for Saturday and the high volume of traffic due to tourist movement., A state of emergency declaration also allows the Rural Fire Service commissioner to exercise powers usually unavailable to them. In December, the premier’s office said these powers would enable RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons to:, direct any government agency to conduct or refrain from conducting its functions;, control and coordinate the allocation of government resources;, evacuate people from property within the declared area;, close roads and thoroughfares to traffic;, pull down or shore up infrastructure at risk of collapse;, order the shutdown of essential utilities in the declared area including electricity, gas, oil, water;, enter or take possession of property in the course of the emergency response., It is an offence to obstruct emergency personnel., In announcing the third state of emergency, Berejiklian said: “We don’t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we’re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday.”, Officially declared “disasters” can include bushfires, floods, cyclones and the like, as well as influenza outbreaks and terrorist acts., Other states of emergency called since 2006 include the Queensland floods and the NSW floods in 2012. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria did not result in a state of emergency being called., When the state of emergency was called in response to the bushfires in NSW in October 2013, Prof Jim McLennan, an expert in emergency management and decision making at La Trobe University, told Guardian Australia that both the severity of the disaster and the length of time it was expected to last were both factors taken into consideration when making the call., “Most emergency response facilities are set up for a 24- to 48-hour sort of situation,” he said. “Extraordinary powers are judged to be needed, for road closures, restriction of areas to members of the public – those kinds of things which over an extended period of time have to be managed rather than left to the judgment of citizens.”nsw state of emergency what does it mean for the bushfires crisis", "label": 0}, "train-24": {"text": "\nAustralian bushfire crisis: global figures and media react to 'climate emergency'\n, Hillary Clinton, Greta Thunberg and Bernie Sanders among those responding to Australia’s unprecedented fires, \nEleanor Ainge Roy, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 01.21 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Jan 2020 06.53 EST\n\n, Politicians and climate change activists around the globe have expressed horror at the unfolding Australian bushfire crisis, saying the devastation is an urgent reminder of the climate emergency., Former US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said the fires – which began during Australia’s hottest ever year – left no room to question the effects of climate change., “With Australia on fire and the Arctic in meltdown, it’s clear we’re in a climate emergency,” Clinton said, going on to detail her support for the Earthshot prize, described by Sir David Attenborough as “the most prestigious environment prize in history”., Bernie Sanders, in the race to become the Democrats’ US presidential nominee, said the scenes in Australia would become “increasingly common around the world” and issued a call to action., “What is happening in Australia today will become increasingly common around the world if we do not aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. The future of the planet is at stake. We must act.”, Author Naomi Wolf shared a message from an Australian father who had been trapped by the bushfires to the prime minister, Scott Morrison., The message read: “Hey @ScottMorrisonMP, my family and I got out of Mallacoota just before the road closed and spent four days stranded in NSW by the #climatefires. I can assure you the cricket being on provided zero solace. I hope you’re good at other things because you’re a useless Prime Minister.”, Morrison has been heavily criticised for deflecting any talk of climate change policy during the bushfire crisis. On Thursday, he accepted a link between reducing emissions and protecting the environment but said the government’s climate policies were adequate., Greta Thunberg, Time magazine’s 2019 person of the year, has shared coverage of the mass evacuations taking place and video of the devastation under the hashtag #Thisisfine., The fires have been covered extensively by media around the world, from the Wall Street Journal (“‘We Were Freaking Out.’ Terrifying Fire Season Takes a Bad Turn in Australia”) to the Times (“Thousands trapped on Australian beaches by ‘apocalyptic’ fires”) and the New York Times (“Thousands Flee to Shore as Australia Fires Turn Skies Blood Red”). The Australian fires were the top story on the BBC website, as well as CNN., CNN’s headline read “Australia’s deadly wildfires are showing no signs of stopping”, while the BBC focused on the mass evacuations: “Race to flee ‘leave zone’ as bushfire threat looms”., In New Zealand, where glaciers turned brown and skies red due to smoke blown over from Australia, many criticised Morrison, with Greenpeace comparing his leadership to that of Jacinda Ardern, who has been widely praised for leading New Zealand through two mass-casualty events in 2019., Former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark said the bushfires were affecting New Zealand’s pristine alpine region. “Impact of ash on glaciers is likely to accelerate melting” Clark tweeted. “How one country’s tragedy has spillover effects.”, Netflix documentary filmmaker David Farrier, also a Kiwi, tweeted Matthew Abbott’s picture of a kangaroo escaping the flames, along with the words: “2020. you fucking idiots in charge who don’t get this: global warming is real.”, 2020.you fucking idiots in charge who don’t get this: global warming is real pic.twitter.com/73m8ftEvcBaustralian bushfire crisis global figures and media react to climate emergency", "label": 0}, "train-25": {"text": "\nWA fires: toilet paper flown in to remote roadhouse as main road closed\n, Caiguna, Cocklebiddy and Madura roadhouses to receive fresh produce as Nullarbor’s Eyre Highway to be closed for at least five more days , \nCalla Wahlquist, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 00.49 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Jan 2020 00.55 EST\n\n, The main road into Western Australia from the eastern states has been cut since Christmas Day, with seven bushfires burning in the south-west of the state expected to worsen under catastrophic conditions on Thursday., The Caiguna Roadhouse, which is 1,000km east of Perth, is the last stop before the roadblock on the eastern side of the Eyre Highway. The western edge of the highway is cut off 320km away at Norseman, and a further 200km of the road to Perth is cut between Norseman and Esperance., The roadhouse had run out of toilet paper on Wednesday and is supporting more than 120 people on a limited supply of desalinated water, with temperatures forecast to reach 48C on Thursday., Roadhouse manager Maureen O’Halloran said another 22 trucks and 50 other vehicles were parked out the front of the roadhouse, on top of the 120 people who had registered and were staying under the shade out the back, and said the crowd was putting stress on the roadhouse’s supplies., Authorities said on Thursday that the road would be closed for at least another five days., @dfes_wa has flown in emergency supplies to Caiguna on the Nullarbor where about 250 people have been stranded by bushfires.

We don’t have rain here so we actually make our water here, so that desalination plant is really really getting smashed at the moment.”, The town of Norseman in the midst of the Great Western Woodlands, which is the largest remaining temperate woodlands in the world, has been cut off on four sides since Christmas Day., “There’s four roads in and out and there’s four closed roads,” Dundas shire president Laurene Bonza said., But she stressed that they were not as badly impacted as communities in the eastern states. Towns in East Gippsland and the New South Wales south coast are being evacuated by air and sea, after surviving the bushfire by fleeing to the beach., “The whole country is on fire,” she said. “It’s a disaster of epic proportions.”, Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system. , Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change., Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding. , Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America., When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California. , Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage., Global heating does not influence all extreme weather – natural variability still exists. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather., Bonza said Norseman itself was well-stocked with supplies, but urged anyone planning to travel along the Eyre Highway to defer their travel or turn back., “They think that there are towns along that road, and there aren’t,” she said. “All of those names along that road are just roadhouses, there are no towns., “The main message that we are trying to get out is people just can’t travel on the Eyre Highway, because they are going to get stuck.”, The Ngadju Indigenous rangers are the firefighting force in Norseman, and they have been supported by volunteers from bush fire brigades from around WA. All accommodation in Norseman is filled with firefighters, Bonza said., The dryness index in Norseman is at 170 – meaning the town will need at least 170mm of rain to reach its saturation point., They had 19mm on Christmas night, which was just enough for give firefighters a break on Boxing Day. They had a barbecue and a swim in the pool., Crews have been conducting extensive backburns but Bonza said the fires remained uncontrolled., “Every time they think they have got it the wind changes and it runs off in another direction.”, The fire danger rating for both the Goldfields and Eucla regions on Thursday was catastrophic.wa fires toilet paper flown in to remote roadhouse as main road closed", "label": 0}, "train-26": {"text": "\nPM Scott Morrison defends climate policies and asks Australians to be 'patient' over fires\n, Labor leader Anthony Albanese says national emergency is ‘enormous’ and there is a need for leadership on bushfire crisis, \nAmy Remeikis, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 23.35 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Jan 2020 09.24 EST\n\n, Scott Morrison has again stressed there is no need for panic, while urging evacuating Australians to remain patient, with the bushfire emergency showing no signs of abating., But the prime minister said the national security committee of cabinet had been called for an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the on-going response to the bushfires., The prime minister made a point of acknowledging the link between reducing emissions and protecting environments against worsening bushfire seasons, but despite mounting criticism maintained his government’s current policies struck the right balance., “Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets, emissions reduction under our government is 50m tonnes more than the previous government and we want to see them continue for this country and continue to better the achievements we have already made, with measures that achieve that,” he said., The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. , The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk., Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. , Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past., The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970., Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists., NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work., “Let me be clear to the Australian people, our emissions reductions policies will both protect our environment and seek to reduce the risk and hazard we are seeing today. At the same time, it will seek to make sure the viability of people’s jobs and livelihoods, all around the country., “What we will do is make sure our policies remain sensible, that they don’t move towards either extreme, and stay focused on what Australians need for a vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment.”, After originally deflecting any talk of climate change policy during the bushfire crisis when it began in October last year, a move which was backed by the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, who accused those of making the link of being “inner city raving lunatics”, Morrison sought to reassure the public he was acting., “Getting the balance right is what Australia has always been able to achieve,” he said. “Right now, the focus as I said at the outset, is to fight these fires, and get people to safety., “That is what we are focused on, that is what state agencies are focused on, that is what the commonwealth is doing through defence forces and other agencies to lend everything that can be done to get that operational response in place, to get help to where it is needed, get people to places of safety and sustain the firefighting effort.”, Morrison also referred to the government’s plans to review “all contributing factors” to the prolonged fire season, which included the inquiry into land clearing, which was set up in early December, to review policies across the states., “Other issues of how you manage hazard reduction are important because, as you say, the impact, more broadly, of climate change on these issues has a pronounced effect on the length of the fire season,” he said., “That, equally then has a need to address issues around hazard reduction for national parks, dealing with land-clearing laws, zoning laws and planning walls around people’s properties and where they can be built in countries like Australia, up and down the coast. That being the case with the climatic effects of what we are seeing, there are many restrictions around those effects that have to be reviewed on the basis on the broader climatic effect we are seeing in this country.”, Thursday was Morrison’s first press conference since Sunday 29 December. Until then, the prime minister had not taken questions from journalists since 24 December., The prime minister spent the morning attending the first of three funerals for Rural Fire Service volunteers killed while defending against the growing New South Wales fire front., Across NSW, Victoria, and South Australia, 17 people have been confirmed dead in bushfires since October, while at least 17 people remain unaccounted for after the East Gippsland fires earlier this week., Morrison said he could understand people’s frustrations but urged them to remain calm., “I would continue to ask people to be patient,” he said. “I know you can have kids in the car and there is anxiety and there is stress and the traffic is not moving quickly but the best thing to do – the best thing that helps those out there volunteering, out there trying to restore some order to these situations is for everyone to be patient., “That help will arrive. There are parts of both Victoria and NSW which have been completely devastated, with a loss of power and communications., “Every absolute effort is in train to ensure that those things can be stood up as soon as possible.”, The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, who has repeatedly highlighted the “constructive” role he has “tried to play here”, said he would leave judgment about Morrison’s response during the bushfire crisis “to others” but added Australia would be paying the cost for years to come., “What we’re seeing, though, I think, is the need for leadership on these issues,” he said. “And, you know, I mean it’s quite right that there have been bushfires in Australia before., “But what we are seeing is greater intensity, the season being longer, and, unfortunately, this could be the new norm and the devastation, and when we talk about economic cost, the economic cost of this crisis, this national emergency is enormous.”pm scott morrison defends climate policies and asks australians to be patient over fires", "label": 0}, "train-27": {"text": "\nNSW Young Liberals' climate push puts them at odds with Morrison government\n, President says the party’s young membership understands the risk if no climate change action is taken, \nAmy Remeikis, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 21.49 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Jan 2020 22.43 EST\n\n, The New South Wales division of the Young Liberals’ push for a change in the government’s climate policy was spurred on by a membership which understands the risk it faces if no action is taken, its president has said., The NSW branch passed a motion at the Young Liberal council in early December calling for a “practical, market-based means” for Australia to cut emissions by 30% of Kyoto levels by 2030, and provide energy market certainty., The motion puts them at odds with the Morrison government, which has stubbornly insisted no change is needed to Australia’s emissions reduction strategy, even as the nation struggles through an unprecedented and deadly bushfire crisis, but is in line with the views of the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, who has demanded more action., The NSW Young Liberal president, Chaneg Torres, said his branch was just doing its job., “The Young Liberals exist within the party to reflect the views of young people, to our MPs, to our wider party, and I think from our point of view, climate change is a particularly important issue for our generation because it concerns the actions of today affecting the lives and quality of life of my generation, but also generations to come,” he said., “And we certainly understand that it is a risk that we will particularly face, my generation, if nothing is done in the present.”, Torres did not go so far as to criticise the Morrison government, which he said had its “heart in the right place”., “And the prime minister has said very clearly that his government and the Liberal party generally accepts the reality of climate change and accepts the need for action,” he said., “But this is an area of policy that has been fraught for many years. I think that, in many ways, the policy well has been poisoned and it has been a very divisive issue in our community., “And I think that in many ways the government has to deal with that fact., “From our point of view, as a young liberal movement, we are reflecting the views of our generation and providing encouragement to the government to take the issue seriously and do what they can to ensure they is a stable and certain policy environment where investment can be made in renewable energy.”, Part of the plan endorsed by the division includes taxation write-offs for green assets, a nationwide solar scheme, and repealing the state and federal ban on nuclear energy so it can be considered for baseload power, as well as increased investment in hydro., The Queensland Young LNP also passed motions calling for nuclear energy to be explored as part of a push to lower emissions at its last conference, but did not go as far as the NSW branch in calling for an emissions reduction blueprint., The NSW branch will send a brief to its state and federal MPs, which are in power at both levels. But Torres said he understood the difficulties, with MPs such as Craig Kelly – an influential backbencher in the party room – still denying the need for any action., “Well, as you know, the Liberal party is a very broad church, but I would say that the youth wing of the party, the vast majority of us believe in the need to take action on climate change and actually I’d say the majority of our membership generally in the Liberal party believe that things need to be done to address climate change,” he said., “I think the vast majority of Liberals would agree with what the prime minister said that we don’t need to choose between a strong economy and action on climate change., “Now we can have a debate about what particular measures we need to take, but I think that the vast majority would agree that climate change is real and the action needs to be taken.”, The NSW division, like the state environment minister, Matt Kean, who made similar comments, has received some pushback from within the party and its supporters for its stance, which Torres would not comment on., But it did receive support from other Young Liberals who said things needed to change., “NSW are being proactive about what real Young Liberals stand for and the other states need to grow a spine,” one senior member said., “Federally, the Young Libs have a policy vacuum and we haven’t got anything to move away from the previous president’s controversial positions on the ABC, gay marriage and Muslim immigration.”nsw young liberals climate push puts them at odds with morrison government", "label": 0}, "train-28": {"text": "\n2019 was Australia's hottest year on record – 1.5C above average temperature\n, Bureau of Meteorology data shows average temperature record across the country beat previous high of 2013 , \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 20.17 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Jan 2020 16.00 EST\n\n, The year 2019 was the hottest on record for Australia with the temperature reaching 1.52C above the long-term average, data from the Bureau of Meteorology confirms., The year that delivered crippling drought, heatwaves, temperature records and devastating bushfires was 0.19C hotter than 2013, the previous record holder., Climate scientists told Guardian Australia that climate change pushed what would have been a hot year into record territory, driving heat extremes and the risk of deadly bushfires., The Bureau of Meteorology data shows the average temperature across the country was 1.52C above the long-term average taken between 1961 and 1990. The second hottest year was 2013, followed by 2005, 2018 and 2017., The data, from the bureau’s long-term ACORN-SAT data, will be used as part of the bureau’s annual climate statement due for release on 9 January., Prof Mark Howden, the director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, said the continued rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused mainly by burning fossil fuels, was the underlying driver of the heat., He said: “It’s very clear that greenhouse gas emissions are changing the radiation balance of the Earth. Other contributors are minor in comparison.”, He said two other climate systems had also played a role in delivering the record hot year., The Indian Ocean Dipole system had drawn moisture away from the centre of the continent, causing extra heat to build there. Another system known as the Southern Annular Mode had also contributed to the heat., The data also shows that 2019 was the hottest year on record for New South Wales, with temperatures 1.95C above the long-term average, beating the previous record year, 2018, by 0.27C., Western Australia also had its hottest year, with temperatures 1.67C above average, beating the previous 2013 heat record by 0.58C., The Northern Territory and South Australia both had their second hottest years, with 2019 coming in fifth hottest for Victoria and sixth hottest for Queensland, according to the data. Tasmania had a relatively cool year, but was still 0.41C above the long-term average., The previous summer of 2018-19 was the hottest on record. The spring of 2019 also delivered the worst bushfire weather since at least 1950, when the Forest Fire Danger Index data began., On Wednesday 18 December, Australia experienced its hottest day on record with an average maximum temperature of 41.9C (107.4F), beating the previous record by 1C that had been set only 24 hours earlier., Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales specialising in extreme events, said 2019 had started hot, with the previous summer being the hottest on record., She said: “The extremes have been seen in lots of heatwaves and, of course, the bushfires, that are a consequence of the very hot and dry conditions.”, She said while natural climate cycles had pushed temperatures higher, “climate change has given them a boost”., “2019 would not have been pleasant anyway, but climate change has made it worse. We are focusing now on the bushfires, but the underlying heat has been driving these conditions for much of the year., “Climate change isn’t the outright cause, but it’s an undeniable contributor to this extreme year on all accounts.”, A bureau spokesperson said it would provide official comment on the 2019 temperatures in its annual climate statement on January 9 that would include a “comprehensive analysis of the year’s weather events and climate context, including any records of note”.2019 australia hottest year record temperature 15c above average temperature", "label": 0}, "train-29": {"text": "\nBushfire-ravaged communities return to ruins – in pictures\n, Bushfire-ravaged communities return to ruins – in pictures, WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Homes turned to rubble, dead livestock and burnt-out primary schools confront locals returning home after massive blazes swept through parts of New South Wales and Victoria , • Latest updates: NSW state of emergency declared as 17 missing in Victoria bushfires, \nMike Bowers, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 20.16 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 20.08 EST\n\n, Photograph: Sean Davey/AAP, Photograph: Sean Davey/AAP, Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian, Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian, Photograph: Sean Davey/AAP, Photograph: Sean Davey/AAP, Photograph: Sean Davey/AAP, Photograph: Sean Davey/AAP, Photograph: Joe Armao/Pool/The Age News, Photograph: Joe Armao/Pool/The Age News, Photograph: Mark Baker/AP, Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardianconjola park fire residents assess remains after bushfire rages through in pictures", "label": 0}, "train-30": {"text": "\nNSW police refer Angus Taylor doctored documents investigation to AFP\n, Australian federal police given referral to investigate whether a crime was committed when energy minister’s office used false figures to attack Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore, \nAmy Remeikis, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 19.55 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Jan 2020 03.07 EST\n\n, The New South Wales police investigation into energy minister Angus Taylor over the use of doctored documents to attack Sydney’s lord mayor has been referred to the Australian federal police., The minister greeted the news by claiming NSW police had confirmed to his solicitors they had “concluded their investigation”., “The minister welcomes that fact,” his spokeswoman said. “This supports his repeated previous statements that neither he, nor any member of his office, altered the document in question., “Of course minister Taylor will cooperate with the AFP and any enquiries they wish to make, although he fully expects they will conclude that this matter is baseless.”, The matter was referred to the federal police on December 20, but has only just been made public., A statement from the NSW police confirmed the matter had been handed over in a two line press release., “Following an investigation by the State Crime Command’s Financial Crimes Squad, the matter has been referred to the Australian Federal Police. “No further comment is available.”, Sky News reported the NSW police have handed over the investigation because of jurisdictional issues, arguing any crime, if there was one, occurred in Canberra, not Sydney., Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore, declares a climate emergency, which is endorsed by the council., 29 September: The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, writes to Clover Moore, claiming the council’s annual report “shows your council spent $1.7m on international travel and $14.2m on domestic travel” in 2017-18., The Daily Telegraph publishes a story on page three and online accusing Moore of hypocrisy over the council’s emissions. The story quotes a letter from Taylor which says the council spent more than $15m on domestic and international travel., Moore disputes the Telegraph story and asks the reporter to provide evidence of this claim., The reporter provides a page from the council’s annual report. The page contains two figures purporting to show the council spent “$14.2” in expenses on interstate travel and “$1.7” on overseas visits. , Moore checks the annual report: on page 14 it shows councillors spent $4,206.32 on interstate travel and $1,727.77 on overseas visits. Moore angrily disputes the story with Taylor via Twitter., Moore writes to Taylor asking him to “ correct a stark error in your letter” saying the $15m figure was grossly inaccurate., Moore lodges complaint with the Press Council., The AFP confirmed the investigation had been referred., “The AFP can confirm it received a referral from New South Wales Police on December 20, 2019, in relation to the alleged doctoring of a document,” it said in a statement., “While this matter is being evaluated, it would be inappropriate to comment any further.”, The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the opposition would continue to pursue the matter when parliament resumed in February., “One of the reports indicates that the AFP have been investigating for some time that it hasn’t been announced today,” he told the ABC., “We need to know exactly what the circumstances are. And we’ll continue to scrutinise that. And scrutinise as well the level of cooperation that is there with any inquiry to make sure that happens. This is pretty clear. There’s a document, it came from somewhere. The evidence will be there, in terms of computer trails of where it came from.”, The NSW police launched an investigation into the origins of an altered document which was used to politically attack the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, after Labor contacted the police to ask if an investigation was warranted., A strike force investigation into the issue was launched, leading Scott Morrison to personally contact NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller, by phone, leading to allegations, which were strongly denied, he had influenced the investigation., At the time, Fuller said he believed the matter would be wrapped up in a week., “To be honest with you, I actually don’t feel as though the allegations themselves are serious, in terms of the things that I would normally stand up and talk about the types of crimes,” he said., “But at the end of the day they’re public figures, and at the end of the day I’m assuming that the public and the media would expect that we take all matters seriously against public figures.”, Exclusive: Angus Taylor investigation referred by NSW cops to Australian Federal police with NSW cops arguing that if an offence occurred, it occurred in Canberra, in the AFP's jurisdictionnsw police refer angus taylor doctored documents investigation to afp", "label": 0}, "train-31": {"text": "\nBushfire tornado tears through Kangaroo Island in South Australia – video\n, A fire twister takes shape on Kangaroo Island, near Adelaide, in footage obtained on Friday.

By the afternoon, she says, the flames appeared to have been taken care of, and so her brother left to have dinner with friends while her partner checked in on family. This left her alone when the fire returned later that evening., “I was in the bedroom when I heard several sirens all race down the road and I immediately started smelling smoke,” she said. “I already had my things packed from earlier so I grabbed all my stuff and ran to the front door. The wind and smoke were insane. I could see a red glow about two houses down., “It was terrifying. I had no way of leaving because all the cars were gone. I called my brother and my partner to tell them what was going on and they both immediately left to get back to me but found the roads were blocked. When they were able to get through I was extremely relieved.”, In Dargan, Susan Alexander and her husband, Nic, who is also captain of the local volunteer fire service, lost their home to the fires on 22 December. She said the insurance assessor told them their street was the worst affected he had seen., “My husband was just exhausted and shattered,” she said. “The fire was so intense. They could not fight it on the ground and 16 homes were destroyed. Our local volunteers have worked so hard and it is devastating for them to see what has happened. Six brigade members have lost their homes, three of whom were actively fighting the beast., “Talking to my husband and many other firies and locals, the lack of resources is why we lost our home. No water-bombing was done, and if it had it would have cooled the fire enough so they could defend it on the ground level.”, Ashleigh Douglas told the Guardian that the blaze in Hillville earlier in November destroyed her family home of 35 years. Her father had built their house himself, and was in the process of renovating with the inheritance from Ashleigh’s grandfather, who lived nearby., “After fighting off the encroaching fire front for three days, my dad had no choice but watch the home he built go up in flames,” she said. “He evacuated and returned two days later, after yet another wind shift, to discover the machinery shed and my grandfather’s house already well alight., “In a matter of three days, my dad’s life’s work was destroyed,” she added., Anna Mould travelled from Sydney with a group of friends to ring in the new year at a boat shed in Narooma, where firestorms rained down fine black drops of ashy water throughout the day., “We woke to an eerie yellow brown light that quickly darkened as the pyrocumulonimbus cloud thickened above the area,” she said. “It was a relatively subdued New Year’s celebration after we progressively lost power, phone reception and finally the ABC radio signal.”,  Mould said that they eventually returned home to Sydney via Cooma and Canberra on 2 January., “It was after a couple of nervous days spent poring over paper maps and comparing information about road closures gleaned from the radio and from the heavily populated evacuation centre in the middle of town,” she said., Linda Heald is based out of nearby North Narooma, where she says the gathering together of smaller fires to the west may see the flames sweep toward her in the next few days. She is suffering from stage-four terminal cancer and worries about losing the precious mementos she wishes to pass on if the fires should destroy her home., “It’s just the waiting,” she said. “On Tuesday I woke to a bright orange sky unlike anything I’d ever seen. The smoke was murky and as the day progressed the sky got darker, three in the afternoon was like night. Ash was dropping and has continued and so everything is still covered in black dust and burnt leaves., “I’m sorting photographs to pack in the car and all the time the thoughts are ‘If I have nothing after Saturday, will this photo be important to me?’ If I walk out of the house and never see any of the personal things, the sentimental things, the useful things again, what will that be like? How can I start again? Not at this stage. I have to have something for the other side of this. And so I keep on packing … and we wait.”, The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has received widespread criticism not only for his handling of the crisis, during which he “deeply regrets” taking a holiday to Hawaii, but also for a lack of funding for the region’s Rural Fire Service (RFS). On Thursday he was heckled and told to “piss off” while visiting residents in Cobargo, where on Monday a father and son were killed by the fires., Alexander said: “I hold the PM and state government directly responsible for the loss of my family home. We didn’t need to lose it.”, After Australia’s hottest-ever decade, comments from those affected by the disaster also reflect a broader concern about the efficacy of the Coalition government’s policy on climate change., Toohey called for the government to “declare a state of climate emergency and act now to prevent further warming and proliferation of more fires”, while Nigel Featherstone from Goulburn, NSW, said: “The ecological impacts will no doubt be devastating – will these systems be able to recover? There are still two months of summer to go.”, Meanwhile, readers from as far away as Queenstown, New Zealand, submitted photographs of the smoke from the fires carried over the sea by the wind.i had no way of leaving readers share their encounters with the australian bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-33": {"text": "\nDeath of the salesman? How Scott Morrison's PR nous deserted him in the bushfires\n, A number of disastrous missteps – a holiday in Hawaii and a forceful handshake – have played into a view that the prime minister is out of touch, \nBen Smee, \n\nFri 3 Jan 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Jan 2020 16.50 EST\n\n, “You are watching the destruction of a political leader,” the former Hawke government press secretary, Barrie Cassidy, said after watching the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in the bushfire devastated NSW town of Cobargo., Leaders are often heckled. In the partisan business of politics, plenty of handshakes have been refused., To experts in public relations, Morrison’s dramatic visit to the bushfire-ravaged village of Cobargo felt like something else – the political death of a salesman, a snowballing of anger at the way Morrison has dodged, dismissed and downplayed the unprecedented natural disaster., “Those images would be devastating for a leader of any political persuasion,” says David Marshall, the former head of Canberra Tourism and Events and a communications strategist who wrote a PhD thesis on the Howard government’s media management., “The prime minister has really got to re-look at the rhetoric and the messages, particularly his New Year’s message when he downplayed the fire situation. People don’t like that. This is devastation, and that messaging from him has been completely off-putting., “That has characterised the snowballing of this issue.”, Time and again, for better and worse, crises have defined political leaders. After the September 11 attacks, George W Bush registered approval ratings of 92%, the highest ever recorded by pollster Gallup. After Hurricane Katrina in 2006, Bush’s approval ratings plummeted after a photograph of him surveying the devastation from the window of Air Force One contributed to a belief he was disconnected from the reality of the unfolding humanitarian crisis., Marshall said John Howard’s reputation was defined by his response to the Port Arthur massacre, which marked him as a strong national leader in a way that transcended party politics., “The Port Arthur massacre and the initiative he took in the gun buyback certainly were the foundations of Howard’s prime ministership. It happened so early after he was elected., “Scott Morrison has unfortunately through his policies on climate change, his refusal to meet with the former fire chiefs ... and then him going to Hawaii, the combination of those events have put him on the back foot in relation to how people would assume a leader should react and act in a situation of crisis.”, Morrison’s unannounced holiday to Hawaii itself became a public relations disaster, partly because of denials issued by the prime minister’s office when rumours began to circulate., On his way home, slightly earlier than expected, Morrison gave a radio interview and said: “I know Australians understand this and they’ll be pleased I’m coming back, I’m sure, but they know I don’t hold a hose, I don’t sit in a control room.”, Morrison, a former head of Tourism Australia had been lampooned on social media as “Scotty from Marketing” for his spin-heavy turn of phrase. Most notable of those expressions are the notion of the “Canberra bubble” and the implicit message that he is better connected to real people, the “Quiet Australians”., Marshall said Morrison’s decision to hold a garden party at Kirribilli House for the Australian and New Zealand cricket teams highlighted “the remoteness of that experience to what tens of thousands of Australians were experiencing, the devastation of the bushfires”., The visit to Cobargo on Thursday evening would have been an attempt to reconnect with citizens, but it backfired., Cassidy remarked on Twitter that Morrison had been unravelled “not by his own party but by his own hand”., You are watching the destruction of a political leader and this time not by his own party but by his own hand. At least you @vanOnselenP saw it coming before most. https://t.co/3uXOaqifbx, Marshall said the images, which have now been broadcast around the world, could be difficult for Morrison to shake. Much of the reaction has focused on the way he forced two unwilling people – a young woman and a volunteer firefighter, who both lost their homes – to shake his hand., “The shouting and abuse that went on surrounding those visits. Rather than sitting down and facing the situation that he turned and walked towards his car and drove off. If you’re a leader you need to lead,” Marshall says., “He’s certainly now trying to reverse that impression. He’s been out there trying to talk to lots of people and trying to take the initiative. That’s to be commended, because he needs to do that as prime minister. But the damage has already been done., “If you look at how Daniel Andrews has handled the situation in Victoria, and Gladys Berejiklian in New South Wales, they’ve been very proactive at a state level, people have been watching them and that’s leadership.”, The footage of such focused rage in regional Australia will also dispel a narrative that anger towards Morrison is a social media phenomenon, not one that existed in the real world. Criticism, such as from NSW minister Andrew Constance, a fellow Liberal, has crossed the political divide., The situation has unmade Morrison’s two most successful marketing phrases. The Canberra bubble has become the Kirribilli bubble, with the prime minister firmly inside. The quiet Australians credited for Morrison’s election win have found their voice.death of the salesman how scott morrisons pr nous deserted him in the bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-34": {"text": "\nDoctors warn people may die as public health impact from Australian fire pollution bites\n, Doctors say there will be unpredictable and lasting consequences, especially for children, the elderly and asthmatics, \nAlyx Gorman, \n\nFri 3 Jan 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Jan 2020 02.38 EST\n\n, As unprecedented bushfires continue to burn along Australia’s east coast, medical professionals are warning of unpredictable and lasting consequences for public health.“I think for the population, what they feel, and the concern they have about this, is probably reasonable,” said Chris Moy, chair of the Australian Medical Association’s ethics and medico-legal committee. Moy said the lasting impact of the bushfires and “the concern with respect to the air quality” was founded. He said “there are people who are going to probably die from these conditions”, particularly those “right at the edge of lung capacity”., He said at this point, the best thing the public could do was follow “common sense” advice such as staying indoors and heeding warnings. However, as the season dragged on, there were “psychological aspects of being stuck inside”., David Caldicott, a consultant emergency physician at Calvary hospital in Canberra, had seen this first-hand over the past few days, as the Canberra region suffered its highest pollution day on record. He said there had “definitely been an uptick in people”. While he noted an increase in elderly patients, asthmatics and those with other respiratory issues, he said the “psychiatric element associated with the potential threat of fire is something that’s often forgotten when people are focusing on respiratory diseases”., “I don’t think you can underestimate the psychological impact of not just the smoke but the existential threat of fire,” he said. “Canberra’s memories are long ... There are people who are anxious and who are vulnerable at times of anxiety who are presenting, looking for reassurance.”, Nigel Cooper, senior manager of programs at Asthma Australia, said: “One of the key things for us is that I don’t think we’ve actually ever seen anything like this before.”, Asthma Australia is conducting a survey on the impacts of bushfire smoke on asthmatics., Cooper said that while increases in presentations to emergency departments would be captured, “the data that will be quite hidden will be how many people lost time from work, how many people increased their medication usage, how many people didn’t exercise or stayed home”. The survey aimed to address those hidden burdens., Cooper was also concerned about the lasting impact on those whose asthma symptoms had been exacerbated., “You’re experiencing increased usage now of your puffers, well how long is that going to last for? How long are you going to be like this? We don’t really know that. It’s a real concern.”, Caldicott warned that parents should be particularly mindful of the impact smoke exposure can have on children., “The usual hazards of childhood are quite different to this sort of chronic exposure,” he said. “People can stay inside but it’s terribly difficult for parents of small kids. I have small kids myself and I don’t want to stash them in front of the telly, but that may be what we have to do for the next few days or as long as this persists.”, In Canberra, Caldicott said: “The only thing that we can do now is try to reduce the harm that the smog is causing”., However, he is a firm believer in the saying “prevention is better than cure”., “This is a significant medical event that tracks directly back to the issues of climate change,” he said. “You remember those photos that they used to put out. ‘This is what happens to your face if you use meth?’ The before and after. Well Australia is the ‘after’ photograph of what climate change does.”, In September 2019, the AMA formally declared climate change a health emergency. Moy said the AMA’s motion passed because climate change has direct health effects., “This is a health effect,” he said. “Let’s just call it, and Blind Freddy can see this. And it is having effects on people at the moment.”, Allison Hempenstall, registrar committee chair of the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, said: “We have to be a united strong voice for the health of our patients and our community and our nation.”, She said: “We need to push for governmental change, prioritising climate change policy which is something that the government isn’t doing at present … The health implications of climate change are only going to be fixed by addressing climate change itself. We need to be moving away from fossil fuels and moving into sustainable and renewable energy sources.”, Caldicott believes this crisis might be a turning point for Australia., “Climate change is an issue like high cholesterol or high blood pressure,” he said. “It’s one of these things that sneaks up on you and you don’t know that you’re suffering from it until you actually have a heart attack or a stroke., “We don’t actually have to be on fire to realise the truth. You just have to smell the fire and it’s a shame that parliament isn’t sitting at the moment. Because this would definitely be a salient reminder to the people that the rest of Australia sends us, about what actually happens when you do things wrong.”doctors warn people may die as public health impact from australian fire pollution bites", "label": 0}, "train-35": {"text": "\nAustralian bushfire crisis: authorities plead for last-ditch evacuation, with terrible conditions ahead\n, Firefighters warn they may have to abandon homes, and even whole towns, as bushfire crisis threatens to overwhelm resources in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, \nBen Smee, \n\nFri 3 Jan 2020 04.47 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Fri 3 Jan 2020 03.03 EST\n\n, Australian authorities have made a final plea for people to flee bushfire-affected areas in three states before the onset of extreme conditions so dangerous that firefighters may be unable to defend entire towns., On Friday, authorities in New South Wales urged people still in a 14,000 square kilometre area of the state’s south coast, and in other high risk areas in the Snowy Valley, to leave overnight., In Victoria – where there are grave fears for 28 people still missing in the East Gippsland region – authorities have sent 250,000 text messages to people in affected shires and urged them to evacuate., Late on Friday, authorities said 3.5% of the Victorian landmass had been affected by fire., Both NSW and Victoria have enacted emergency measures that give firefighting authorities the power to forcibly relocate people if necessary., In South Australia, warnings have been issued for two fires on Kangaroo Island, which firefighters have said they cannot prevent from spreading. SA country fire service chief officer Mark Jones said he would be “astonished” if homes were not already lost., Forecasters have predicted temperatures in the mid-40Cs on Saturday for some parts of south-east Australia. The fire danger will be increased by strong winds., On Friday, the military continued evacuations of the Victorian inlet of Mallacoota, where about 4,000 people were trapped by a fire that reached the edge of the township and blocked their exit. Most were being taken on a 17-hour voyage by ship to the HMAS Cerberus naval base at Western Port., The defence forces have also been dropping supplies to communities isolated by active firegrounds., The prime minister, Scott Morrison, toured an evacuation centre in Victoria on Friday as he faced heavy criticism for his response to the escalating and unprecedented bushfire crisis., On Thursday night, Morrison was given a hostile reception in the NSW town of Cobargo, where he was heckled by people who had lost their homes., On Friday, the former NSW fire commissioner Greg Mullins compared the prime minister’s response to the bushfires to Donald Trump’s response to mass shootings., “People are angry, and ... if people want to direct that at me, that is up to them,” Morrison said. “It’s not something that will distract me. It is something that I will empathise with. It is something that I understand. It’s not something for me to take personally., “This is not about any one individual, not me or anyone else. We all have to a job do.”, NSW authorities have warned some towns, including the apple-growing hub of Batlow, may be “undefendable” in the extreme conditions and that in those circumstances firefighters may allow properties to burn rather than risk attempting to contain the fire., “We are unfortunately very likely to lose homes tomorrow but we will be very happy and call it a success if there are no lives lost,” the NSW rural fire service deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, said., “That is a single focus tomorrow and we need the community to have the focus as well.”, RFS briefing in #Narooma also advising ppl who choose to stay &amp; defend to put their yellow-lidded recycling bins out (weighted down) so fire crews know where people are. 🟡🗑🔥#nswfires @abcnews, The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, held a press conference on Friday afternoon to tell people on the south coast and in other affected areas that by Saturday morning it would be too late to leave., “There is a window until tonight, for people to get out and we encourage them to do so, please do not stay in the area unless you absolutely have to,” she said., People on the south coast continued to report heavy delays in leaving the area, and long queues to buy petrol and other supplies., There are additional concerns for mountainous areas in NSW and Victoria, where people in the Kosciuszko national park and the Victorian alpine region have been told to evacuate., Fires continued to burn uncontrolled and bushfire smoke continues to shroud a massive area. Air quality in Canberra again ranked among the poorest in the world on Friday, thanks to smoke from the bushfires., The national fire season has claimed at least 19 lives and destroyed more than 1,500 homes.

Tomorrow promises to be a very difficult day, and we want to see you all at the other side of it., Updated\nat 4.15am EST\n, \n\n3.46am EST\n03:46\n\n, This is the full quote that Scott Morrison says is being taken out of context, helpfully put in context by Amy Remeikis., Scott Morrison says comments saying he said people would be inspired by the cricket were “taken out of context” . Questions of his leadership/other issues “are for others to Twitter about” pic.twitter.com/i9e4xH0N7t, \n\n3.43am EST\n03:43\n\n, Asked if he thought, in retrospect, that it was odd that he picked up people’s hands to shake them, Scott Morrison said he tried in “good faith” to offer comfort., He said that some people were more standoffish than others and “I understand that, it’s a. very emotional time., You seek to try and in good faith, and in good will. , He said his comment that Australians during these “terrible events” would be “inspired by the great feats of our cricketers” had been “taken a bit out of context.”, Asked if he wished he had responded differently to the bushfires, Morrison said it is “not about me,” it was about people on the ground., That’s what I’m focused on. Not on the other issues. That’s for others to Twitter about. That’s for others to Twitter about., He said comments from former fire chiefs that they had not been listened to were “not true.” Those fire chiefs said the Coalition ignored their advice because it concerned the climate emergency., Morrison said he was listening to the fire chiefs “that are in their jobs now.”, Then came this abrupt exchange., Leila McKinnon: Have you been working the phones trying to get more resources from overseas?, Morrison: Of course., McKinnon: Can we expect any more planes?, Morrison: Yes., McKinnon asked when those planes would arrive. Morrison didn’t really answer. , And then the interview was over., Updated\nat 4.40am EST\n, \n\n3.31am EST\n03:31\n\n, Scott Morrison is giving an interview with A Current Affair right now and repeating the line that his response to the bushfire crisis is “not about me.”, The first question, from host Leila McKinnon, does not pull any punches., McKinnon: , People didn’t even want to shake your hand out there, do you feel that you have lost the respect of Australians?, Morrison says that people are “really hurting” in fire zones, and he has visited many fire zones and attempted to offer comfort. That offer of comfort has received “different receptions wherever you go”, he says., He says the people of Cobargo were feeling “very raw” and he tries not to “take any of that personally”., Jenny and I went to offer comfort and some didn’t want to. Some did., McKinnon asks if Morrison regrets walking away from 20-year-old Zoey Salucci-McDermott, who said she would only shake his hand if he increased funding to the RFS., Morrison repeated a claim he made earlier today, which we put to Salucci-McDermott and she disputed., Said Morrison:, Zoey and I did speak, actually, of her concerns about and she did raise the issue the level of support for the RFS., Morrison said he told her he would pass her concerns on., Updated\nat 3.42am EST\n, \n\n3.16am EST\n03:16\n\n, There are community meetings up and down the east coast tonight, ahead of extreme bushfire conditions tomorrow., Huge turnout at Mt Beauty for community briefing on fires. Residents told “we’re expecting a very bad day tomorrow” @9NewsMelb @9NewsBorderNE pic.twitter.com/js3GnD3kJX, evening briefing in dear narooma. they are expecting saturday to be as bad as it gets but this place is well set up and will be fiercely defended. if you're still in bushland around here and don't like the look of that map, come to the evac centre now. don't wait. pic.twitter.com/zMDAMK8qV2, \n\n3.05am EST\n03:05\n\n, While we wait for that interview, a reminder that this happened today., Pity the poor #Australians, their country ablaze, and their rotten @ScottMorrisonMP saying, “This is not the time to talk about Climate Change. We have to grow our economy.” What an idiot. What good is an economy in an uninhabitable country? Lead, you fuckwit!!, \n\n3.02am EST\n03:02\n\n, Political reporter Amy Remeikis has written a day-by-day account of prime minister Scott Morrison’s activities in the past eight days, tracking his diary — which included engagements like the New Year’s Day Cricket Australia-McGrath Foundation reception at Kirribilli house — alongside bushfire developments., Morrison is giving an interview to A Current Affair in a few moments. We’ll bring that to you as it happens. , \n\n2.52am EST\n02:52\n\n, A woman who lives in Cobargo has driven a 100km round trip to Bega today to upload a video to social media demanding that prime minister Scott Morrison show leadership and offer immediate assistance to Cobargo and other towns in the bushfire crisis., Ronnie Ayliffe is the sister of Mark Ayliffe, the Cobargo RFS captain. She says Mark was concerned that the criticism of Morrison by locals in Cobargo during his whistle-stop tour yesterday meant that he had lost his opportunity to ask — and receive — federal assistance in fighting the fires., “My brother is a shell of a human being, he is hanging on by a thread,” Ayliffe said. “He holds the burden of everything that is lost on his own shoulders, and yet he has done a job that generals couldn’t do. He has been extraordinary and I want you, the world, to know that., She continues:, Yesterday, Mr Scott Morrison, prime minister of our nation came to visit Mark., And Mark thought this will be a lovely time that I can ask for help. Please help us. Help us to fight this again, help us to rebuild, help us with generators and fuel and... help us, help us. , But then this happened. And Ayliffe said her brother was concerned that his only opportunity to ask for help had passed. , But I don’t think asking nicely is going to get us anywhere... the only way we are going to get anything is if you, the world, demand it. , Tell Mr Morrison to help us. And not just Cobargo — but especially Cobargo — but everyone impacted by these fires. Help us in the immediate sense with things that will help us to survive this. Good god, we’ve got no power, we’ve got no telecommunications, we have got nothing but death and destruction...., Demand it. Tell him to be a leader. Tell him he has to help all of the people affected by fires. The time for being nice and asking nicely is over. I want you, the world, to demand it. Don’t forget us. , Ayliffe lives at Sams Creek, which is just outside Cobargo. She said she has spent the past few days shoring up protections around her house, but did not believe she would be able to save it., Tomorrow the fire is going to come with a ferocity that’s going to take your face off, so I don’t think I’m going to have a house. , \n\n2.27am EST\n02:27\n\n, There is a community meeting and bushfire briefing in Narooma on the NSW south coast tonight. ABC reporter Melissa Clarke is there, and shared this practical, yet chilling, advice., RFS briefing in #Narooma also advising ppl who choose to stay &amp; defend to put their yellow-lidded recycling bins out (weighted down) so fire crews know where people are. 🟡🗑🔥#nswfires @abcnews, \n\n2.11am EST\n02:11\n\n, At 6pm there are 138 fires burning across NSW, with 74 uncontained. Tomorrow will bring dangerous fire conditions for much of the state, particularly in the south. The NSW RFS advises people to leave a number of areas before tomorrow: https://t.co/xqhIbgjhvA #nswrfs #nswfires pic.twitter.com/FyK63ETntO, \n\n2.08am EST\n02:08\n\n, There has been a lot of discussion over the past week about hazard reduction burns. Specifically, whether more hazard reduction burns could have prevented the current bushfire crisis, and whether hazard reduction burns have been prevented by “green tape.”, I thought I would draw attention to this thread from environmental scientist Cormac Farrell, who works in bushfire prevention and is also the Australian Parliament’s head beekeeper., He says, basically, that community safety trumps environmental concerns when it comes to hazard reduction burns. So if burns are happening less often it’s because it is not safe to do so, not because greenies are blocking them., I keep hearing people talk about how the RFS cannot do hazard reduction burns because of all the paperwork. I have done some of this paperwork in the past. It is overwhelmingly about safety. Our window to safely burn is rapidly diminishing. Yes, this is climate change., This is a beautiful Hyacinth orchid growing in an Asset Protection Zone I was assessing recently. Did I sign the death warrant for this delightful forest friend? You bet your ass I did - there are houses 30 metres away, and this an existing APZ. pic.twitter.com/DtllWp4rRW, I’ve also seen some discussion about fuel reduction burn targets being abandoned. I’ve spoken to fire authorities in Victoria and Tasmania about this before, and the consensus wisdom is that the targets do not work because the easiest way to meet a target is to lob blazeballs out of a helicopter and burn a big bit of bush in the middle of a state forest or national park., That will hit the five or 10% fuel reduction target, but will not necessarily be the kind of targeted hazard protection that actually makes the community safer. , \n\n1.59am EST\n01:59\n\n, Conditions appear to be worsening in East Gippsland. , The town of Bruthen, east of Bairnsdale, has just been ordered to evacuate., EMERGENCY WARNING - BUSHFIREIncident Location: Upper Snowy Area - Goongerah NurranMore details at https://t.co/bzOGtWS4lL pic.twitter.com/Iy5XTWExCM, And there’s a new emergency warning for the northern parts of East Gippsland, near Goongerah., EMERGENCY WARNING - BUSHFIREIncident Location: Upper Snowy Area - Goongerah NurranMore details at https://t.co/bzOGtWS4lL pic.twitter.com/Iy5XTWExCM, \n\n1.48am EST\n01:48\n\n, This is what residents are being told on the south coast of NSW. Tourists have been strongly advised for two days to get out — they should already have left., Advice from #Narooma police:- those in sml communities, leave &amp; go to major centre- don’t believe ‘scare-mongering’ rumours online- prepare to lose power &amp; comms- there are ‘reasonable’ resources, but “the whole idea of tomorrow is to save lives” over property.#NSWfires, Updated\nat 1.50am EST\n, \n\n1.41am EST\n01:41\n\n, Speaking of sport, the fire alarms at Melbourne’s AAMI Park seem to have been set off by the bushfire smoke that has settled over the city. Earlier, Victorian authorities said the air quality in the city was “very poor” to “hazardous”., ...That’s new. pic.twitter.com/GtCHYLNneU, The A-League match between Melbourne City and Western United is due to start at 7.30pm., And now it seems like the fire/evac alarms are being triggered by the smoke. Perhaps those in charge should treat that as a sign that the game shouldn't go ahead https://t.co/IJOsoV4qop, Updated\nat 1.43am EST\n, \n\n1.34am EST\n01:34\n\n, Let’s do a round-up of sports-bodies and persons raising money for bushfire relief., Tennis Australia has announced it will host an exhibition match at Rod Laver Arena on 15 January to raise money for the Red Cross bushfire appeal. It’s also donating the profits from a Jessica Mauboy concert, scheduled for 19 January, and pledged $1m to help rebuild tennis facilities in bushfire affected communities., The idea of a charity exhibition match was raised by Nick Krygios, who has encouraged a flood of donations and offers of support from other athletes., The AFL has also said it will raise funds for bushfire relief. CEO Gillion McLauchlan said in a statement today that the organisation was working on a coordinated response to support fundraising efforts. , CEO Gillon McLachlan has released this statement today on the bushfire crisis. pic.twitter.com/AK4mjKU9wP, Nathan Buckley has also said... this:, Leadership is hard. Put your hand up and accept what could have been done better, by you and by others. Then accept the vitriol, the hurt and the pain. Listen, understand and empathize. Then take action. Firstly for today and then for tomorrow., Updated\nat 4.00am EST\n, \n\n1.24am EST\n01:24\n\n, This is the map of predicted fire spread in NSW that deputy commissioner Rob Rogers was speaking about earlier. The red zones are areas where the fire is expected to grow, the crosshatched areas are areas of potential ember attack., Fire Spread Prediction for Sat 4 Jan 2020Dangerous fires in Shoalhaven, South Coast, Snowy Mountains &amp; areas surrounding Greater Sydney. You should not be in potential spread areas or potential ember attack areas on Saturday. #nswrfs #nswfires pic.twitter.com/Ry14FXgPR2, But, as noted earlier, this only covers existing fires. New fires — and with extreme to catastrophic conditions throughout southeast NSW, you can bet on new fires starting — could occur outside of these highlighted areas. , Updated\nat 1.27am EST\n, \n\n1.20am EST\n01:20\n\n, Here is the video of that interview with Zoey Salucci-McDermott, the pregnant 20-year-old woman at Cobargo who refused to shake prime minister Scott Morrison’s hand., EXCLUSIVE: We spoke to 20-year-old Cobargo resident Zoe Salucci-McDermott, who attracted attention yesterday when she refused to shake Scott Morrison's hand.Tune in to 10 News First at 5pm to watch @tegangeorge's full story. #australiabushfires #NSWbushfires #australiaisburning pic.twitter.com/Tym8XH64fo, There has been a bit of inconsistency with the spelling of Zoey’s name, but it is with a -y.

At its peak flies a 22kg Australian flag, which, at the same size as a double-decker bus, takes three people to change., For the past week, it’s been all but invisible. The flag has flown at half-mast, honouring volunteer firefighters who died attempting to protect their communities from unprecedented blazes which have scorched an area the size of Belgium. But for much of this week, it has been unseen, hidden by a smoke haze, that has left Canberra, affectionately known as Australia’s “bush capital”, claiming the title of having the worst air quality in the world., Canberra is often dismissed as existing within a bubble, home to public servants, politicians, journalists and other wonks, who sit, cocooned, against the trials and tribulations of real Australia., Those people exist within the 420,000 strong population, along with thousands of Scott Morrison’s “quiet Australians”. All have been breathing in hazardous air for days, pushed by winds from the surrounding, unstoppable fire fronts. But for one senator, the politicians who have repeatedly voted against climate action in Australia are not breathing it. They’re only in Canberra when parliament sits and it won’t sit again until February., Canberra—yes, Canberra, pop. 400,000—currently has the world’s most polluted air. https://t.co/QFJcR3MXjG pic.twitter.com/vKjD7eD7bW, Smoke haze has become synonymous with the 2019/2020 Australian summer. Images of Sydney, Australia’s most famous city, smothered in a brown smog, its glittering harbour and landmarks stained as if drenched in old tea, have already been sent around the world., Canberra, about three-and-a-half hours further inland, is usually buffeted against environmental contaminants. Unique as one of Australia’s only “planned” cities, Canberra’s geography and topography usually protect its clean air., On New Year’s Day, it experienced its worst air quality on record, with residents of Australia’s eighth-largest city told to stay indoors, effectively shutting it down. Residents hadn’t seen anything that bad since the deadly 2003 bushfires, which took the region by surprise. Authorities hadn’t seen anything that bad since air quality monitoring records began in Canberra, a decade and a half ago., It’s hard to say happy new year, literally. My lungs sting but my heart breaks for those actually facing &amp; fighting the fires. Thinking of family, friends, students &amp; colleagues at risk. May everyone please be safe as can be &amp; make it through this. And may 2020 be a turning point pic.twitter.com/3OGUuxIUgH, Air quality index readings above 200 are considered hazardous to health. On Wednesday, readings at one Canberra monitoring site peaked at 7,700 at 1am. As the day progressed, they hovered between 3,400 and 5,000, depending where in the city you were., AND THERE IT IS. 5000 plus.

The city felt all but shut down, as health authorities issued warnings to residents to stay inside, shut all doors and windows, and turn off evaporative air conditioners, despite the blistering heat., “We also strongly advise people who are sensitive to smoke, especially those with pre-existing heart and lung conditions, to take extra care during these conditions,” the advice continued. “People who are sensitive to smoke and air pollution can be more vulnerable to heat-related illness as well, so staying hydrated and cool is important., “People who are able to do so, are also encouraged to check on others who they think might need extra help, to see that they are OK.”, Babies were being born into bushfire smoke-filled delivery rooms., Back home after a 3am birth.

I will pass on your feedback about the punctuation used in this message.-Hannah, Air purifiers were sold out across the region, with retailers unable to say when more would arrive, given the transportation issues., P2 masks, usually the domain of home renovations, were sold out just as quickly. As residents attempted to organise their own supplies, including university students arranging for hundreds to be carried in the luggage of students returning from interstate holidays, authorities said they were moving to provide masks to those most vulnerable – but the best protection was just to stay inside., But the smoke was there too. University campuses were shut, as were major tourism attractions, including the zoo, swimming pools and and some banks and civic services. Those who returned from the nearby New South Wales south coast, escaping the flames, found air heavier than the fire-threatened towns they were fleeing. Baseball and tennis tournaments were cancelled, with the games moved somewhere the air was less harmful to the players and spectators., Climate crisis casualty my beautiful friend of 3 decades Lara collapsed in the heat &amp; smoke in Canberra.

People spent 24 hours in their cars in the hope of being allowed to leave with police escorts in groups of 20 to 50., The evacuation had to be stopped for an hour and a half in mid-afternoon on Friday after the fire flared and trees fell across the road., By Friday, Bendalong and Manyana were some of very few coastal towns, along with Sussex Inlet in the Shoalhaven, that still had unburned bush. Loved for their forests stretching down to the beach, the villages were ringed by fire, in some places burning just 200m from houses., No one is confident about what will happen on Saturday. The forecast is for catastrophic fire danger, high temperatures and strong winds., If it reaches the crowns of the towering gums, it will burn all the way to the beach. With 700 people in the caravan park and another 4,000 in houses – all without electricity for four days – the Rural Fire Service made it clear they wanted everyone to leave., Sheridan O’Donnell from Newcastle, and Louie Racht from Sydney had been staying with their families in Bendalong., They were fourth in the line to exit early on Friday afternoon and had been been there for 24 hours. Luckily their house was so close they could sleep there, but had spent hours waiting in the line of nearly 400 vehicles., They had a fallback plan but were hoping to leave., “The beach is really close so we can evacuate there. We might run out of food, because we threw it out because we thought we were leaving,” O’Donnell said., “We might need to make damper in the barbecue if we have to stay another night,” said Leah, 10., O’Donnell had nothing but praise for Peter Jackson from the Austinmer Rural Fire Service, who took charge of the evacuation plan, providing the daily briefings and managing the flow of cars., “He was just here on holidays like us. Now he’s our kids’ new hero,” she said. “He’s the sort of leader we need. Peter Jackson for PM.”, Verity Magdalino, her husband Tim and her two children, Luke, seven, and Finn, 11, had been holidaying at North Bendalong, an even more isolated hamlet., “We came here for the first time to discover the south coast,” Magdalino said. “With the kindness of strangers we have been very well looked after. We only had enough food for a week, but when we ran out our neighbours invited us round and brought us food. There is always some good that comes out of interesting situations.”, Petra Holmes, from Wollongong, was staying in the caravan park with Chanel, seven, and Talia, 12, and two children of friends. They were also waiting with their car packed to go., Holmes’s husband was meant to come down on New Year’s Eve and swap with her so she could go back to work, but he was unable to get through., “We have had the van here since I was a kid – it was my parents’ – so I have been through bushfires before,” Holmes said. “A couple of times we slept on the beach. I can remember one time when I was five or six., “But this feels a bit different: not having power and trying to get this volume of people out.”, They packed up on Thursday with plans to leave the following day. But only a few got out before the road was declared too dangerous., “So we’ve been waiting since this morning … It’s really the kids. They are a bit over it and all the talk that tomorrow Saturday is going to be really horrendous.”, Holmes knows lots of the permanent van owners and the community looked out for her, she said., “We are OK, and everyone has been so lovely,” she said., By late afternoon on Friday only a few people remained, determined to defend their homes and prepared to seek shelter on the beach or even, with lifejackets at the ready, in the water.one road out the nervous wait to evacuate a nsw town ringed by bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-40": {"text": "\nAustralia fires weather forecast: worse to come as hot, dry, windy Saturday set to fan bushfires\n, Bureau of Meteorology expects conditions in NSW, ACT and Victoria to be as hazardous if not worse than those on New Year’s Eve, \nStephanie Convery, \n\nFri 3 Jan 2020 01.42 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 20.08 EST\n\n, Dangerous fire conditions are expected through much of south-eastern Australia this weekend, where temperatures rising into the mid 40Cs will add to already hazardous conditions and fuel out of control bushfires that continue to burn., Heat and winds that developed over Western Australia on Thursday and pushed through South Australia on Friday are expected to reach Victoria and New South Wales on Saturday., The expected extreme conditions prompted the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to declare a week-long state of emergency on Thursday., “We don’t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we’re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday,” she said., The Bureau of Meteorology expects conditions in NSW, ACT and Victoria to be as hazardous if not worse than those on New Year’s Eve, when hundreds of fires burned across the country, destroying huge swathes of bushland and hundreds of properties, and forcing thousands of people to flee., “We are seeing very dangerous fire danger conditions developing over the next few days, with a real concern on Saturday through eastern parts of Victoria and southern NSW,” said Jonathan How, forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology., Dangerous conditions were observed in South Australia on Friday, where many places recorded highs of over 40C. Hot winds pushed ahead of a cold front, bringing thunderstorms with some heavy rain, although not in the southern part of the state where fires were burning, including at Kangaroo Island., Temperatures were in the high 30s around much of Victoria on Friday. Those temperatures are expected to rise into the low to mid-40s on Saturday, accompanied by a hot and strong northerly wind, that will tend north-westerly in NSW and north-easterly along the coast., Dry conditions are expected to continue for NSW and the ACT on Saturday, with daytime temperatures again reaching into the mid 40s. Thunderstorms are possible over the south, central west and northern ranges, but not expected to bring much in the way of rain., The bureau is expecting severe fire danger for parts of the Mallee, Northern Country and East Gippsland, reaching extreme for the north-eastern Victoria and across the border into NSW. They expect fires to flare with the hot wind., “We will see extreme fire danger for many communities that have seen these very ferocious fires pass through on New Year’s Eve, so that does include places such as the Shoalhaven-Illawarra area, southern ranges and south coast, and also the ACT,” How said., Pockets of bushfire smoke are expected in the east and over the western slopes of NSW, along with possible dust. Dust is also expected over Victoria’s north-west, with areas of smoke haze in the east., Smoke haze is expected to continue in Canberra, where the air quality has been at extremely hazardous levels since Wednesday.

Temperatures in northern NSW will remain above average but the south should see some relief., The bureau has warned that the cool change will hit affected regions later than it did on New Year’s Eve, expected to arrive Gippsland in the afternoon, and moving up the coast into the evening. Sydney, where temperatures are expected to peak at around 34C near the coast and 45C in the western suburbs, will feel the change closer to midnight., Isolated showers are forecast to develop over south-western Victoria later in the weekend but are only expected to bring daily totals of about 5mm-10mm., “The main difference for many communities is that it will be a lot cooler than what we will see on Saturday,” How said. “However, it’s going to be quite dry, and with those winds it could be quite smoky as well.

The dams are virtually empty … We’ve still got a long summer ahead of us now.”australian dairy farmers shore up supplies as they prepare for bushfire flashpoint", "label": 0}, "train-42": {"text": "\nWhere the bloody hell was he?

The prime minister’s office declined to fill in any of the blanks for this article, other than to note that Morrison has remained in constant contact with premiers, defence force chiefs and fire authorities, as well as his own cabinet ministers, to stay abreast of the situation., The prime minister is spotted going for a swim at Sydney’s Bronte beach with his mother and children by the Daily Mail., More than 30 fires are considered out of control, although the slightly easier conditions are used by firefighters to carry out more backburning operations in a bid to prepare for worse days ahead., National party MP Darren Chester calls for volunteer firefighters to be paid, breaking ranks with the government position., Morrison is not seen but releases a statement announcing ADF liaison officers will be placed in every fire control centre., The NSW emergency minister, David Elliott, announces he will be going overseas on leave, but will return if needed., Scores of fires remain out of control, with almost 1,500 volunteer firefighters deployed in an attempt to bolster containment lines., The environment minister, Sussan Ley, announces up to 30% of NSW’s mid-north coast koala population may have been killed in the blazes., Warnings of the New Year’s Eve heatwave and catastrophic fire conditions begin to circulate., Firefighters continue attempts to set up containment lines, while battling up to 70 blazes., Morrison is not seen publicly., Morrison announces NSW RFS volunteers will be paid $300 a day, up to $6,000, in federal government funds, to be administered by the NSW government, with other states eligible to apply for the same funds., He holds his first press conference since Christmas Eve, calling media to the NSW RFS headquarters., Despite having said volunteer firefighters “want to be there” when asked about payment in early December, and calling it a distraction when asked on Christmas Eve, Morrison says the government has been working on the payments “for some time”., Victorian authorities order the evacuation of a vast area of East Gippsland., Everyone in East Gippsland must leave the area today due to the fire danger forecast for tomorrow.

That number would double by 2 January., Morrison is not seen in public but hosts the annual New Year’s Day Cricket Australia-McGrath Foundation reception with the Australian and New Zealand teams at Kirribilli., He does not take questions but releases his address to the teams, where he says the forthcoming Sydney Test will be “played out against terrible events” but that “at the same time Australians will be gathered whether it’s at the SCG or around television sets all around the country and they’ll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think they’ll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians”., The navy deploys HMAS Choules to Mallacoota to help evacuate residents and tourists stranded on the beach., Both the Victorian and NSW fire authorities say they believe the fires will burn for months. Victoria’s emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, says “only nature” can stop the blazes, while the NSW RFS deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, says: “You could have 10,000 fire fighters on each fire we would not be able to get around these fires.”, The prime minister attends the funeral of Geoffrey Keaton, one of two NSW RFS volunteers killed last week., He holds a press conference later in the day to announce his cabinet’s national security committee will be meeting on Monday, while urging Australians to “be patient” and remain calm., He also highlights some of the challenges, beyond the evacuations:,  “Down in Cobargo and places like that, where we know, where dairies have been milking and they simply have to pour the milk down the hill because of the lack of power to those areas at this time., “That is the tragedy of what is occurring as a result of these disasters.”, And he defends his response to date:, “In the midst of the disaster, I understand the anxiety and I understand the fear that is there for many and I understand the frustration but this is a natural disaster. Natural disasters are best dealt with through the methodical, well-coordinated response that we are seeing today.”, He reiterates he has no plans to change Australia’s emissions reduction policy.,  “What we will do is ensure that our policies remain sensible, that they don’t move towards either extreme and stay focused on what Australians need for a vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment. Getting the balance right is what Australia, I think, has always been able to achieve.”, Morrison spends the afternoon touring some of the communities which have been all but destroyed by fire, with his wife, Jenny. He receives a frosty reception in the NSW town of Cobargo, which has been heavily affected with three deaths and much of the main street destroyed.

Other locals heckled the PM, saying they had been ignored., Speaking to reporters in Bairnsdale, Morrison said he did not turn his back on Zoey but “stood there with the same lady you’re referring to” and talked to her – contradicting both Zoey’s account and what is shown in footage of the interaction., “We talked about what she was asking there, which was greater support for the firefighting effort in that part of New South Wales,” Morrison said. “So we talked about that.”, The reaction of Cobargo locals was “totally understandable”, says former Cobargo publican Roz Jessop., Jessop’s voice shook as she listed the towns that had burned on the NSW south coast., “In Cobargo the whole village is gone. Mogo is gone, a lot of Batemans Bay is gone,” she said. “We were good friends with Robert and Patrick Salway, who died defending their family property near Cobargo, we have known them most of our lives.”, Jessop and her husband ran the Cobargo Hotel for years, before selling in 2001 and moving to Bournda, about 80km south towards Merimbula., “I am absolutely gutted,” she said. “I don’t want to drive out there, I don’t want to see it – the only thing standing is the butchers, the chemist and the hotel. The school is gone. The church is gone – my god, my mum is buried out there. It’s just gone.”, Locals in that region have been asking for additional firefighting capacity and hazard reduction burns for years, Jessop said. Fire authorities across Australia say the extended fire season has narrowed the window during which hazard reduction burns can safely take place., “They asked for people to listen, and they did not listen,” Jessop said. “It the hostile reception to Morrison’s visit is understandable.”, Bournda has not been blocked out in red in the RFS’s map of the predicted fire spread for Saturday, but it remains within the south coast evacuation area., Fire Spread Prediction for Sat 4 Jan 2020Dangerous fires in Shoalhaven, South Coast, Snowy Mountains &amp; areas surrounding Greater Sydney.

A number of people who were part of the original 17 missing people were located yesterday.”, It comes after Andrews declared a state of disaster for East Gippsland on Thursday night. The declaration entails powers introduced in the aftermath of devastating 2009 Black Saturday blazes which have never been used before, including compelling people to evacuate., Residents in north-eastern communities including Biggara, Tintaldra, Towong, Towong Upper, Walwa, Nariel Valley, Lucyvale, Berringama,Koetong, Shelley and Burrowye were ordered to get out., “If you can leave, you must leave.

There are issues I need to resolve formally when working through issues of that nature. That is my inclination on that issue. We’ll make a further announcement and arrangement on that accordingly.”, Morrison was due to travel to India on 13 January, before heading on to Japan during the five-day trip. Speaking to Melbourne radio 3AW on Friday morning, Morrison said it was an “important meeting”, and that the plan to attend was “still in place.”, “But, you know, when you are dealing with these issues, you need to consider the relative merits of the choices,” he said., The prime minister announced he had accepted Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s invitation to visit back in October, where he was also due to deliver the inaugural Raisina Dialogue address, which aims to discuss the biggest challenges to the global economy., For Australia, one of those challenges is its fractious relationship with China, with coal exports seen as one of the flashpoints., Australia has increasingly looked to India as a potential buttress against any economic fallout with China, with Morrison making strengthening his relationship with Modi one of his priorities since becoming prime minister., The Coalition has also been an unwavering supporter of the Adani Carmichael mine in central Queensland, with minister for resources and northern Australia Matt Canavan a vocal supporter. Canavan attended a lunch with Adani executives  during an official visit to Calcutta in August last year., The government has often pointed to the 1.3% of global carbon emissions Australia is responsible for, when answering criticisms over its climate policies. A report by the Australian Conservation Foundation, released mid last year, found Australia was responsible for at least 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, if the pollution from the nation’s fossil fuel exports was included., Once the pollution from proposed projects was factored in, which included the Adani mine, that number had the potential to jump to 17% by 2030., Morrison has held firm to his view the government had its climate policy settings right, despite admitting the link between climate change and worsening bushfire seasons., “Let me be clear to the Australian people: our emissions reductions policies will both protect our environment and seek to reduce the risks and hazards that we are seeing today and at the same time, it will seek to ensure the viability of people’s jobs and their livelihoods all around the country,” he said on Thursday., “What we will do is ensure that our policies remain sensible, that they don’t move towards either extreme and stay focused on what Australians need for a vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment. Getting the balance right is what Australia, I think, has always been able to achieve.”, The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, who has also been supportive of Australia’s coal industry, said the decision of whether to go to India or not was one for the prime minister., “The prime minister will have to weigh up whether it’s appropriate for him to go or not,” he said., Albanese said he believed people were now seeing the warnings scientists had issued about the worsening impacts climate change would wreak against Australia, and wanted action., “One of the reasons why we have seen, I think, some frustration expressed by people on the ground, they don’t want to be told it’s a natural disaster,” he said., “Yes, Australia’s had natural disasters in the past. We haven’t, in my lifetime, had people on beaches waiting to be evacuated in life jackets, sending boats out to sea like it’s a peacetime version of something that we have seen during wartime.

The interview was broadcast on New Year’s Eve in a special show reviewing key international issues of the decade., Abbott said: “While we still seem to be in the grip of a climate cult, the climate cult is going to produce policy outcomes that will cause people to wake up to themselves.”, After claiming, incorrectly, that a focus on emissions reduction in Australia had caused blackouts and rising power prices, Abbott said: “Sooner or later, in the end, people get hit over the head by reality.”, The host of the show, Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation foreign editor Eran Mor-Cicurel, interjected part-way through the interview, pointing out Australia had been hit by fires and disasters “happening again and again”., The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. , The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk., Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. , Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past., The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970., Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists., NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work., Mor-Cicurel asked Abbott if he was “denying that fact we are in the process of global warming and global change”., Abbott responded that while there was “no doubt that climate has changed”, previous warming events had happened before the industrial revolution., Abbott’s points are contradicted by every major science academy in the world, as well as the expertise of government science agencies in his own country., His anti-science views on climate change are well known in Australia and have been corrected many times by leading climate scientists but Mor-Cicurel was not aware of his views before the interview., Mor-Cicurel told Guardian Australia the radio network had been reporting regularly on Australia’s bushfire crisis and was not aware of Abbott’s views before the interview., He said: “Personally I was surprised by Abbott’s views on climate change. I did not expect a former prime minister of Australia to be so blunt about environmental issues in the middle of an environmental crisis in Australia., “When we put it to air, people were terribly angry at us for airing such extremist views, especially from environmental organisations that were annoyed that we had given the stage to these kinds of views.”, Well, Israel is a small country with big problems. However it has a large and vocal environmental movement. They were outraged. Some have blamed us for spreading lies as they failed to differentiate between the broadcaster and the interviewee., Abbott said changes to climate in the past “makes me think as a matter of simple logic that carbon dioxide emissions, particularly human carbon dioxide, are not the only, or even the main factor here”., He said that “all things being equal of course we should try and reduce our carbon dioxide emissions”., But, he said: “The last thing we should do is drive our industries offshore and be putting pressure on household budgets and risk third world-style blackouts all in the name of climate change. We have got to be sensible and balanced and proportionate about these things and I don’t think other policy makers are right now.”, Australia’s bushfire season began in August, much earlier than usual, and has claimed at least 19 lives, destroyed more than 1,600 homes and burned at least 4.6m hectares of land – an area more than double the size of Israel., Earlier in the interview, Abbott named three key themes for the globe over the past decade: the “challenge of China”, the “climate cult” and the “ongoing Islamist challenge”., He said: “I think the western world has continued to suffer from serious self-doubt over the last decade and it’s exacerbated by the rise of what are effectively new religions like the climate cult and there is an ongoing Islamist challenge … and it’s been obvious since September 2001.”, Abbott was prime minister from September 2013 to 2015.

I don’t take these things personally, why would I?, “I know that people are hurting, I know that they are raw, and I know what our job is and it is to work closely with the states to support them and everything that they need and to preempt their requests and ensure that our defence forces and other agencies are ready to go.”, The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, declined to criticise the prime minister’s leadership, but said a more national response was required., “My only concern here is that there seems to be an approach which is that people have to ask for support rather than a proactive sitting down, which would be what would happen with Coag, around the table and say what is needed,” he said., “Certainly I think defence assets, every one of them, at this time should be available. “This is the scale of what is occurring here, of a mass evacuation. Not from a town, from a region that is bigger than most countries in Europe.”, Asked if he was “confident” he had done everything he could, Morrison said: “Well, of course., “I mean, this is a massive fire, that has been running across four states – arguably now five, because Tasmania has been affected more recently as well … ” he said., “So it is our role to support and give every assistance we can, and I appreciate what premier Andrews has been saying about that.”, The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, defended Morrison and said cooperation between the state and the commonwealth had saved lives., “I think emotions are high, these are very tense times when people have lost everything and I can understand that people, you know, it’s very difficult, very, very difficult circumstances,” Andrews said., “As the premier of Victoria, I can only say thank you to the prime minister for the partnership we have … The partnership between our emergency services, led by Victoria police and the ADF, is unprecedented and I’m very grateful for the partnership and open dialogue and the constant communication I’ve had with the PM., “That’s keeping Victorians safe.”, The prime minister’s forced attempt to shake a woman’s hand was shown around the country, an image which was repeated when he was snubbed by an exhausted firefighter who also rejected a handshake. Morrison later said to the incident controller he was sure the man was just tired, to which he was told he had lost his home., Gosh this is so awkward.

Glad’s going to come back, but this is the feeling that people are going through.”, Morrison said he had not heard those comments., The prime minister received a warmer reception at the evacuation centre he visited on the outskirts of Bairnsdale, Victoria, on Friday morning.scott morrison brushes off angry bushfire reception personally", "label": 0}, "train-50": {"text": "\nFalling ash, skies of blood – and now Australia’s anger smoulders\n, The past week has been marked by the refusal of public officials, including PM Scott Morrison, to recognise the scale of the crisis, \nRoyce Kurmelovs, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 13.20 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Jan 2020 16.00 EST\n\n, The sky over Cobargo in New South Wales was still tainted yellow on Thursday afternoon when Australia’s prime minister arrived. For the past month, the country had been ablaze, and the village 240 miles south of Sydney and home to 776 people, had been hit hard., Standing in the crowd, Zoey Salucci McDermott, 20, eyed Scott Morrison coolly. She and her young daughter had lost her home in the fires, so when he extended his hand in greeting, she did not reciprocate. “I’ll only shake your hand if you give more funding to the RFS Rural Fire Service,” McDermott said, holding back tears. “So many people here have lost their homes. We need more help.” The prime minister turned away., Days before, two separate firefronts had swept across much of southern NSW and eastern Victoria with unprecedented ferocity, wiping entire towns from the map. When the flames arrived in Cobargo, they tore through the main street, roaring like the ocean, incinerating lives and livelihoods., Robert Salway, 63, and his son Patrick, 29, died when they stayed behind to defend their property. Patrick’s wife, Renee, who is pregnant with the couple’s second child, found their bodies., As the flames retreated, a white hot anger smouldered. “You’re not welcome, you fuckwit,” a man yelled after Morrison as he retreated under a barrage of insults. Referring to the affluent Sydney suburb where the prime minister has an official residence, he said: “I don’t see Kirribilli burning after the fireworks.”, The scene, caught on video, has become symbolic of a nation at odds with its leadership as it has endured a week of horror in a rolling, months-long national emergency that has yet to reach its climax., The scale of the destruction is hard to overstate. When the Amazon rainforest caught fire last January, 906,000 hectares burned. And last July, 2.6 million hectares were turned to ash across the Siberian steppe., Since the first fires began in Australia in August, more than 5 million hectares have been set aflame, fanned by unusual weather patterns and lower-than-usual humidity that has allowed firefronts to spread rapidly across a bone-dry landscape. The country’s volunteer firefighting forces are exhausted, outgunned and overwhelmed., The fires are behaving in unpredictable ways, spreading at night and even returning to areas that have already burned. Conditions on the ground have seen walls of flame, spot fires coalescing into fire tornados and some firefronts burning so hot they have formed their own weather systems. The ensuing lightning strikes have gone on to ignite yet more fires., The direct death toll stands at 23, with more expected. Some species have been pushed to extinction, and more than half a billion animals are estimated to have been killed. Farmers have reported running out of bullets as they work to end the suffering of half-dead livestock., Of all the states, New South Wales has been hardest-hit, with 3.41 million hectares scorched over the past few months and Sydney, at one point, finding itself encircled by active firezones. Around the same time, fire ripped through the Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island in the central state of South Australia. In the Adelaide Hills in South Australia, flames swallowed 25,000 hectares of prime agricultural land, leaving a third of the wine industry in the area “smashed”., The state of Victoria in the southeast, meanwhile, greeted the first week of the new decade in horror as it watched new firefronts bloom in East Gippsland before quickly building into an inferno which blackened 700,000 hectares in days., Wherever the fires rise, their approach has been foreshadowed by falling ash and the dimming of light as blue skies turn either nicotine yellow, glowing orange or, in some cases, blood red. That was the scene in Mallacoota, a tourist town 260 miles east of Melbourne in the middle of a Unesco biosphere. As the rest of the world readied to bid goodbye to 2019, locals spent their New Year’s Eve watching the flames approach., Residents woke to find skies blackened by ash and temperatures rising to 49C at 8am. As daybreak turned to night, the sky grew red as the flames drew near., With the only road out of town soon cut off by fire, 4,000 people were forced to flee towards the beach. When traffic backed up, people abandoned their cars. Soon after, the emergency services ordered people to wade into the sea to escape the blaze., Over the next two days, as images of the destruction began to emerge on social media, an evacuation order was given for some 14,000 sq kms between Nowra in New South Wales and the border of Victoria., Across the state lines, Victorian state premier Daniel Andrews declared an official state of disaster in Gippsland on Thursday night, enacting sweeping powers that have never been used., Weeks after an advertising campaign began in the UK to attract tourists to Australia, tens of thousands of holidaymakers were evacuated from coastal NSW and Victoria, the largest peacetime evacuation in the country’s history, with the navy deploying to rescue those trapped in Mallacoota., Authorities in those states which have so far escaped the devastation have been left to watch on nervously. Peak fire season typically hits with the height of summer, leaving those states so far unaffected to wait their turn – with far fewer resources., With bushfires flaring so early in the year, volunteers have been sequestered from across the country to assist on the east coast. Their absence means states like Western Australia are reliant on ex-volunteers in the event of emergency.Even regions relatively unaffected by the fires have been unable to escape the consequences. Smoke drift has stained glaciers as far away as New Zealand. In Canberra, the nation’s capital, air quality has been so bad that the postal service has stopped delivering mail., Liz Bashford from Doctors for the Environment Australia said the smoke has probably already caused deaths. Preliminary statistics show mortality rates, ambulance callouts and hospital admissions all increasing since the smoke settled over Sydney, but the precise impact won’t be known ubntil at least the end of this month., “Bushfire smoke will increase the incidence of death, but to say it was responsible for a particular death is much harder,” Bashford said. “It’s a bit like smoking cigarettes. If someone dies of respiratory problems and they’re a smoker we can clearly say it contributed to their death, but it’s very hard to put the finger on the only thing that caused their death.”, “All this has been predicted for decades by scientists but it’s happening in a far quicker and in more dramatic way this fire season than we expected.”, Morrison has shrugged off criticism of his government’s climate change policies. Speaking at the UN in New York last September he insisted Australia would meet its emissions reductions targets “in a canter”. That same month, his government was being warned about the catastrophic fire risk presented by climate change., Former New South Wales fire chief Greg Mullins and 22 other former emergency services chiefs wrote to Morrison outlining the potential crisis and asking for more specialised equipment to deal with hotter and longer bushfire periods., They were ignored. Emergency services have been asking for resources since 2016, when the National Aerial Firefighting Centre asked for a “national large air-tanker fleet” to support firefighting operations but were rebuffed., The consistent refusal to stump up the cash or even engage with a chorus of experts warning about a crisis has defined the conservative government’s policy since it took power under Tony Abbott in 2013., Now, as the country faces one of the worst natural disasters in its history, a short-term, transactional austerity politics has collided with the long arc of climate change in a way that is clearly visible on the ground., Firefighters in some areas have been forced to crowdfund for basic equipment while until recently the federal government remained steadfast in its refusal to back-pay volunteers for their time, even as the prime minister praised their “spirit”. It took sustained public pressure to drag the government to compensate volunteers, with Morrison announcing last Saturday that they would receive up to $6,000., The denial of reality was seemingly reinforced on New Year’s Day, when Morrison held a reception for a professional cricket team at Kirribilli House, the official residence.In a throwback to an earlier scandal when Morrison was photographed on holiday in Hawaii as the first homes were lost in New South Wales,, As the country burned, the prime minister was pictured playing backyard cricket.“Whether they’re started by lightning storms or whatever the cause may be, our firefighters and all of those have come behind them to support them, whether they’re volunteering on the front line or behind the scenes in a great volunteer effort, it is something that will happen against the backdrop of this test match,” Morrison said., These words might have been of little comfort to locals huddled together on a beach in Mallacoota against the approaching inferno on Tuesday morning and who were, on Saturday afternoon, again bracing for “another round”., Brendan, a Mallacoota local who asked that his last name not be printed, told the Observer how three branches of his extended family were now living under one roof as the fires had destroyed the homes of friends and family., “We chose to live here. We love this part of the world, and we’re really quite devastated at the destruction that’s taken place,” Brendan said. “We had a fire plan, we went over it at Christmas, all together. We still didn’t know how big the burn would be.”, While they weren’t in any imminent danger, Brendan said the firefront had remained active around the town as of noon and an expected change in weather conditions threatened to make the situation unpredictable., A few hours later Brendan posted to social media another image showing the eerie sky over Mallacoota. It carried the ominous caption: “I don’t think we’re getting light back today. We’re relaxed enough that we’re going to make some dinner. I believe the risk that today’s weather posed has passed, for us at least.”australia bushfires week of anger scott morrison", "label": 0}, "train-51": {"text": "Australian blazes rage as PM calls up ADF reserve – as it happened, This blog is now closed. , \nChristopher Knaus, \nKatharine Murphy and \nLuke Henriques-Gomes, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 08.42 EST\n\n\n\nFirst published on Fri 3 Jan 2020 15.25 EST\n\n\n, \n\n7.09am EST\n07:09\n\n, As we near 11.30pm (AEDT), the situation remains fluid and dangerous across parts of NSW and Victoria. , Here’s what we know so far:, We will return to our live coverage early tomorrow morning, when the scale of the damage from this evening’s fires will be made clear. , Updated\nat 7.15am EST\n, \n\n6.50am EST\n06:50\n\n, An emergency warning has been issued for the area north of the Shoalhaven River.

The state’s transport minister, Andrew Constance, defending his own home against ember attack, told ABC radio “this isn’t a bushfire, it’s an atomic bomb”., The bodies of the two people, identified as Dick Lang, 78, a bush pilot and safari operator, and his son Clayton, 43, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, were found after fire burned through more than half of Kangaroo Island. The bodies were found inside a burned-out car on a highway. The fast-moving fire front appeared to have overrun the vehicle while the occupants were fleeing., “It has been absolutely devastating,” the Kangaroo Island mayor, Michael Pengilly, told the ABC. “The north coast looks like it has been hit by a nuclear bomb. You can’t stop this thing at the moment, it’s bloody impossible.”, Australia’s two most populous states, NSW and Victoria, have had their east coasts devastated by massive out-of-control fires that have destroyed more than 1,500 homes and claimed 23 lives so far. That number is predicted to rise., Six people remain missing but this figure is down from 28. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes., The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said on Saturday that 148 fires were burning across the state, 12 of which were at emergency warning alert level., Victoria’s Emergency Management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said there were 53 fires across the state, with the vast majority of those in the eastern half of the state. Thirteen fires were at “emergency warning” level., There were also current fire warnings in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia., A sense of anxiety gripped NSW on Saturday, as the gruelling long-running catastrophe of the bushfire season rolled on., “Right here, we are the meat in the sandwich,” the RFS divisional commander, Mark Coombes, began a shift briefing of new volunteer firefighters at Nowra, on the NSW south coast, “so thanks for coming down”., The southerly is going to hit ... What it’s going to do I have no fucking idea., Ringed by fire to the north and south – with flames 40 metres high, running through forest that hadn’t burned in decades – the crews of volunteer and professional firefighters prepared for the fourth, and in forecast most serious, of the extreme days the state had faced already this summer., “The southerly is going to hit around 9pm, 9.30pm and unfortunately you’re the ones that have to deal with it,” Coombes said. “What it’s going to do I have no fucking idea.”, His info was off by about 90 minutes, and the southerly roared through the base with reported gusts up to 101 km/h, whipping up dirt and dust and ash, and filling the briefing room with smoke., On the outskirts of Adaminaby, a village of about 300 people in the Snowy Mountains in southern NSW, an acrid smoke turned the sky black by mid-afternoon and mud, dirt and ash rained from the sky while a small crew of volunteer firefighters fought two blazes approaching the town from the north and west., The Adaminaby Complex fire – which split into two sections – was one of five fires burning at an emergency warning level in the Snowy Mountains region and which cut electricity to large parts of the state., Glen Squire, the captain of the local Rural Fire Service brigade, told the Guardian his small crew of volunteers had been working for weeks to protect the town. But properties further into a dense forest of mountain ash trees were “undefendable”., “We’ve been trying to get people out there to leave for a while but some of them have stayed, I wouldn’t want to be there,” he said., Morrison said on Saturday that fire authorities were “well-prepared, well-organised and well-resourced” but governments, fire crews and communities needed to be realistic and understand that some blazes would not be able to be stopped., “These fire conditions are unprecedented and the challenge is formidable,” he said. “If fierce conditions prevail, today could be a dark day for our country.”, Morrison warned that, with no substantial rain forecast, the fires could burn for weeks, beyond the capability of fire crews to control or extinguish., “This length of season is, of course, in many senses, unprecedented, but the ferocity and the absence of dousing rains that would normally bring a season like this under greater control is nowhere in sight and so that means a much longer season is planned for.”, The compulsory call-up of army reserve troops to help bushfire-hit towns across the country survive the ongoing bushfire crisis and recover from its impacts is the first in Australia’s history., Soldiers will provide “civil aid, humanitarian assistance, medical or civil emergency or disaster relief”, the defence minister said in her order to troops., The governor general formally called up the defence force reservists for an open-ended commitment from Saturday “until revoked”., The Australian Defence Force will also provide accommodation to families who have lost their homes on defence force bases., National capital Canberra and the outer western Sydney suburb of Penrith both broke temperature records on Saturday that had stood for 80 years., The temperature reached 48.9C in Penrith and 44C in Canberra on Saturday afternoon, the hottest temperatures recorded in those areas.australia fires death toll rises and six people missing as pm calls in military", "label": 0}, "train-53": {"text": "\nMorrison's government on the bushfires: from attacking climate 'lunatics' to calling in the troops\n, From May 2018 to January 2020, the Coalition government has had an evolving stance on the fire crisis, \nStephanie Convery, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 04.13 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Jan 2020 04.26 EST\n\n, From describing bushfire warnings as the concerns of “inner-city raving lunatics” to calling in the defence forces, the following is a timeline of Scott Morrison’s government’s evolving stance on the fire crisis., The National Aerial Firefighting Centre sends the commonwealth government a business case requesting a permanent increase of $11m to its annual budget. Payments are made on a top-up basis only., The Emergency Leaders for Climate Change, a group of 22 former emergency services leaders led by former commissioner of NSW Fire and Rescue Greg Mullins, writes to the federal government alerting them to the threat of “increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events and calling on both major parties to recognise the need for “national firefighting assets”, including large aircraft, to deal with the scale of the threat., The Emergency Leaders for Climate Change write again to Morrison asking why the government has not yet given them a meeting, despite being told on 4 July that Angus Taylor’s office would be in touch to arrange one., “It appears that Minister Taylor, or perhaps his office, fails to grasp the urgency of this matter,” Mullins writes. “I must assume from this response and the months of delay in Mr Taylor making contact, that the minister appears at best disinterested in what the Emergency Leaders might have to say.”, Australian defence force liaison officers start working with Emergency Management Australia., Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, raises the link between climate crisis, drought and bushfire activity after the town faces down an inferno that killed two of its residents. “We are so impacted by drought and the lack of rain,” she says. “It’s climate change, there’s no doubt about it. The whole of the country is going to be affected. We need to take a serious look at our future.”, The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, tells Radio National that it is “pure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies” and “inner-city raving lunatics” like Richard Di Natale and Adam Bandt from the Australian Greens that are “trying to get a political point score” for raising the link between climate crisis, drought and the devastating bushfires., David Littleproud, the minister for emergency management, says that Taylor’s office has received no formal request for a meeting from Mullins or the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action but that his office will reach out to them., Australia is rated the worst-performing country on climate change policy out of 57 countries in a report prepared by international thinktanks. The report also criticises the Morrison government for being a “regressive force” internationally., Morrison attempts to reassure voters that he understands bushfires are a natural emergency and that he accepts the link between climate change and an extended fire season, while dismissing international censure of his government’s climate policies as “not credible”., Reports circulate that the prime minister has gone on holidays to Hawaii, as Sydney battles extreme smoke pollution as out-of-control bushfires burn through the Blue Mountains. The prime minister’s office says his whereabouts are “not a story” and that claims he is on holiday in Hawaii are “wrong”., Littleproud says he met with Mullins and told the delegation they “should take great comfort and great pride in the current cohort of fire chiefs around the country who have planned meticulously for these fires”., Littleproud says fighting bushfires is “obviously … the responsibility of states but the federal government kicks the tin. We don’t walk away from this.”, The Emergency Leaders for Climate Action say they will hold a summit after the current bushfire season because of their “huge disappointment in the lack of national leadership during a bushfire crisis”., It comes as fires raged across New South Wales and Western Australia on Monday and as Australia was named as one of a handful of countries responsible for thwarting a global deal on the rulebook of the Paris climate agreement., Two volunteer firefighters, Geoffrey Keaton, 32, and Andrew O’Dwyer, 36, die fighting fires south-west of Sydney when a tree hits their tanker., Morrison says he will return from holidays. “I deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,” he says in a statement. “Given the most recent tragic events, I will be returning to Sydney as soon as can be arranged.”, Morrison returns to work and signals the Australian government will not increase its efforts to combat climate change despite the bushfire crisis and record-breaking heatwave. He says drawing attention to climate crisis and emissions reduction policies during the bushfire season is an attempt to “score political points” during a disaster., He says the government is considering calls to pay volunteer firefighters but notes that is “in the first instance” a matter for state governments., Morrison says calls to reduce carbon emissions are “reckless” and that Australia doesn’t need to do more on tackling climate crisis. He rejects calls from the opposition to bring forward a meeting with state governments to address the bushfire crisis., Morrison agrees to compensation payments made to NSW volunteer firefighters who have lost income due to fighting bushfires, but he sees no further role for the commonwealth. “We’re there to help the states and territories as they address these crises. The states are the ones, as premier knows all too well, who are directly responsible for the funding of their fire services and all the other things that are done.”, A third NSW RFS volunteer, Samuel McPaul, is killed when his truck rolls during extreme conditions at a fire near Jingellic, on the NSW/Victoria border., Morrison releases a statement through social media offering condolences to McPaul’s relatives and emphasising the leading role of the state and territory firefighting authorities in the bushfire crisis. He says the commonwealth will continue in its role of providing “support” to those efforts., Morrison shares his new year message urging Australians to celebrate living “in the most amazing country on earth” and remember “there’s no better place to raise kids anywhere on the planet”. He does not make any connection between the bushfires and global heating, suggesting that Australians had faced similarly terrible ordeals throughout history., Later that day, Morrison hosts the annual New Year’s Day Cricket Australia-McGrath Foundation reception with the Australian and New Zealand teams at Kirribilli in Sydney. In his address to the teams, he says forthcoming Sydney Test match will be “played out against terrible events” but that “at the same time Australians will be gathered whether it’s at the SCG or around television sets all around the country and they’ll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think they’ll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians”., At a press conference, Morrison says he’s “always acknowledged the link … between the broader issues of global climate change and what that means for the world’s weather and the dryness of conditions in many places” but that “no response by any one government anywhere in the world can be linked to any one fire event”., Morrison reiterates he has no plans to change Australia’s emissions reduction policy. He defends his government’s response to the fires by saying he doesn’t want state and federal governments “to be tripping over each other in order to somehow outbid each other in the response”., Navy ships and army aircraft are dispatched to help fight bushfires in Victoria., While initially saying it was “still the plan” to go to India later in January for trade and defence talks, at which Australia’s coal exports were expected to feature heavily, Morrison says only hours later that he is “inclined not to proceed” with the visit, which has now been postponed., The army reserve is called in to assist with firefighting efforts., Morrison says the federal government will agree to a request made 18 months ago to permanently increase funding to Australia’s aerial firefighting capacity., The prime minister’s office releases an ad spruiking its firefighting efforts, backed by a jaunty jingle., We’re putting more Defence Force boots on the ground, more planes in the sky, more ships to sea, and more trucks to roll in to support the bushfire fighting effort and recovery as part of our co-ordinated response to these terrible #bushfires pic.twitter.com/UiOeYB2jnvmorrisons government on the bushfires from attacking climate lunatics to calling in the troops", "label": 0}, "train-54": {"text": "\nFrom Tina Arena to Elizabeth Warren: the big names weighing in on Australia's bushfire crisis\n, Scott Morrison’s favourite singer took to Instagram to condemn Australia’s climate inaction, \nBen Doherty, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 02.59 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Fri 3 Jan 2020 22.26 EST\n\n, Australia’s bushfire crisis has dominated international news, leading newspapers worldwide, influencing US presidential primary campaigns and attracting celebrity concern from across the globe., In the US, with the 2020 election’s first Democratic caucus in Iowa just under a month away, the Australian bushfires have been cited as evidence of a global climate crisis, and the need for urgent action., Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said the world’s future depended on collective action to address climate change – a Rooseveltian Green “new deal” – and said climate denialists needed only look at Australia’s experience for evidence of the dangers of delaying action., I say to those who are delaying action on climate change: Look at the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires.

The smoke was too thick., Days after Ritar, his partner, Kirsten Bradley, and their son, Ashar, hunkered down in a home as fires raged on the Victorian coastal town of Mallacoota, the Tasmanian family were among those rescued by the Australian navy., Speaking to Guardian Australia a few hours before the ship docked at Hastings, east of Melbourne, Ritar was still stunned by the scale of the crisis., “You look down upon these giant shipping containers on the main deck with red kangaroos on the side of them and big words emblazoned on them, Australian Aid,” he said., One adult would stay in the safest room with a group of children. It was under a concrete slab and had no windows, “Australia’s had bushfires forever, but we’ve never had to call in the navy to evacuate 1,000 people from a coastal town. That doesn’t happen. It’s hard to wrap your head around.”, Mallacoota, now only accessible by air and sea, has become a symbol of the unprecedented nature of the bushfire crisis., About 4,000 people, mostly holidaymakers, were forced to the foreshore as fires moved quickly towards the town. If the heat got too close, they were told, they would have to get in the water., On Saturday a red haze hung over the town once again, signifying that the fires terrorising other parts of the state might yet return to Mallacoota., 2:25pm at Mallacoota. The south westerly winds have hit. @9NewsAUS pic.twitter.com/5nGYQksDHQ, In the lead-up to New Year’s Eve, the fire threat had crept up on the holiday town, though it was not among those listed in a mass evacuation throughout eastern Victoria., As it became clear that the threat was increasing, Ritar’s family moved from his in-laws’ place to a family friend’s house around the corner. At all times, Ritar said, one adult would stay in the safest room with a group of children. It was under a concrete slab and had no windows., The others set up a generator and watched for updates on their mobile phones. They also went out into the street to see which homes were still occupied, sealing properties that had been abandoned in a hurry., In between, they would pop back to the house for a coffee., “It’s kind of this strange mix of panic and boredom, waiting for the fires to come or the winds to change,” Ritar said., By the morning of New Year’s Eve, sirens rang out across the town. The sky turned black, then bright red. In the distance there was the sound of popping: gas bottles or cars exploding., “That’s a scary sound when you can hear it getting closer and closer,” Ritar said., They ventured out again. “This is when we could see the really big plumes of smoke coming towards us,” he said., We walked a couple of kilometres along the beach before it just got too heartbreaking, A house with cars parked around it caught fire less than 100 metres away. “It went off like a bomb. That was the probably the scariest moment.”, Country Fire Authority crews came in a truck and had almost extinguished the blaze when they ran out of water. They couldn’t come back. “They had to go,” said Ritar. “They obviously had bigger problems.”, Mallacoota did too. A wind change pushed the worst of the blazes west of the centre of the town but dozens of homes were destroyed in the fires. With all nearby roads closed, the town was completely isolated. Helicopters and police boats ferried in food and other supplies but reports of shortages emerged., Across several kilometres of beach at Bastion Point, dead birds sat in lines along the sand. Ritar listed those he saw: a kookaburra, then a magpie, then a barn owl, then a king parrot, then a New Holland honeyeater., “They would have been swept out into the clouds and then deposited in the ocean,” he said. “Then they’d washed up on the shore as bits of charcoal and burnt leaves. One after the other, just asphyxiated by the fire. We must have walked a couple of kilometres along it before it just got too heartbreaking.”, On Wednesday the Victorian government confirmed it had called in the defence force, and the navy would send HMAS Choules and a number of smaller vessels to evacuate hundreds of people by sea. By Friday, Ritar and his family were gliding along the water towards the safety of a navy vessel normally deployed to assist in overseas humanitarian disasters., “Normally, I think he would be pretty excited to see such a thing,” Ritar said of Ashar, 10., On board, the mood reflected the varied experiences of those on board. “There’s people here who have lost their homes, they’ve evacuated because they literally no longer had a home,” Ritar said., “There’s other people who are backpackers from around the world. They’re doing what young people do, meeting each other, playing cards and laughing and joking.”, The evacuees were transported to a disaster relief centre at the Melbourne convention centre on Saturday afternoon.mallacoota burns panic on the ground as the australian navy called in", "label": 0}, "train-58": {"text": "Australian heatwave: Canberra and Penrith smash temperature records that stood for 80 years, Mercury hits 43.6C in Canberra and 48.9C in Penrith, making it one of the hottest places in the world, Canberra and the outer western Sydney suburb of Penrith have broken temperature records that have stood for 80 years., The mercury climbed to 48.9C in Penrith and 43.6C in Canberra on Saturday afternoon, the hottest temperatures recorded in those areas.

But the Country Fire Service chief officer, Mark Jones, said it was expected the fire would continue to burn for several days., Marshall said the government had appointed a community recovery officer and would look at what additional support islanders would need in the coming days., “It’s clear that South Australia has had an extraordinarily difficult time with extensive damage right across our state,” he said. “Our focus at the moment is doing everything that we possibly can to contain the fire on Kangaroo Island.

People began responding with similar offers, so Riley started a database of volunteers and began matching them with those seeking help., In four days Riley’s impromptu organisation, FindABed, has received offers of accommodation from more than 3,000 people. They have so far helped some 50 people from fire-affected areas – many with pets, who would otherwise find it difficult to secure accommodation., “It can be anything from just somewhere to have a cup of tea and wait, to somewhere to stay more long term,” Riley told Guardian Australia. “We even had someone who just wanted a shower.”, Just repeating for anyone evacuating with animals: we have empty fenced paddocks available and we can house horses, etc indefinitely.

They evacuated on 30 December to Tathra, only to find themselves evacuating again when a warning of approaching fire came through at 3.30am., Six adults, six children and three dogs – her family as well as her friends’ families – then made their way to Bega, where they got stuck. Concerned about protecting their children from embers falling, they started to erect a camp in the underground car park of the local Safeway, when the trolley attendant, a Sudanese refugee named Ibrahim, stopped them and offered his home for the night – a tiny flat above the shops., “He found us all beds and his girlfriend cooked us all a big meal,” Mikkelsen wrote on Facebook. “We sheltered there the night and played music with the only instruments we had, a recorder, a ukulele, some spoons and two flashlights for the light show. The couple told us it was the best New Year’s Eve they had ever had.”, She told Guardian Australia: “It was just such a beautiful gesture.” , Stories of resilience are emerging from inside bushfire-affected communities too, such as that of a Malua Bay pharmacist, Raj Gupta, who has kept his pharmacy open despite the area having no power or mobile phone service – and despite the fact that his own home burnt down in the fires this week., “I’ve had my patients come in and say they’ve not only lost their house and their belongings but also their medication,” he told SBS., The loss of power means he cannot take payment for the medications. “People will come back and pay,” he says. “They are very honourable people.”, Many evacuation centres are taking in domestic animals and even livestock, setting aside space for them alongside their owners., These puppers have all been evacuated from the East Gippsland bushfires.

The Afghan community group the Kateb Hazara Association made a $18,252 donation to the Rural Fire Service., In December a group of four men from Sydney’s Muslim community in Auburn took a ute loaded with sausages, water and a barbecue, and drove six hours north to Willawarrin to cook for the community after fire tore through the small town in November., “We can’t fight fires but we can put a barbecue on,” one of the men, Jawad Nabouche, told the ABC. “It’s the least we can do, to try help the community and help everybody up here and put a smile on everybody’s faces.”, CFA volunteer Bob calls into the ABC Gippsland to say the Islamic community has come to Lakes entrance with 4-5 trucks carrying food and supplies. \"First round of snags are already cooked and they just need customers,\" he says. \"Everything is free.\" #vicfires, Some communities have been banding together to prepare for potentially dangerous conditions ahead. Karen-Burmese refugees in the town of Nhill, in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, have produced in-language bushfire safety videos with the help of the Country Fire Authority for newcomers to their community. The region regularly faces hot, dry summers, with temperatures in the high 30s expected in the coming week., Celebrities and public figures have also been contributing to the bushfire relief campaign., The comedian Celeste Barber raised an estimated $5.5m in donations in 24 hours for firefighting services after posting an appeal to Instagram, accompanied by images of the eerie yellow light that could be seen from inside her mother-in-law’s house.,  This is my mother in laws house.

The gig raised $44,500 from sales of tickets, merchandise and direct donations, with the band rounding up the total donated figure themselves., The Melbourne pop singer G Flip raised an estimated $10,000 in donations from her Falls replacement gig on Monday night.

Half asleep, I wondered if there had been a volcanic eruption. At 9am our son came running in to wake us, saying there was something weird and wrong outside. Outside, in our caravan park near Narooma, it was still dark. The sky was low and a strange orange colour. All around us people were leaving, or hosing down their caravans. The power was gone. Ash was falling and the air was thick with smoke. At the campsite reception, where we tried to find out what was going on, we were told fires were closing in; if we left we couldn’t return. If we stayed and were trapped we would need to go to the beach to escape the blaze., I called my dad at his new place in Cobargo but he wasn’t answering. I called his partner, Sally, who answered in tears and told me the town was gone, fire was everywhere, everything was burned. It had swept through about 5.30 – around the time of the thunderclap. My dad had gone out into the flames and disappeared and Sally didn’t know where he was., Dad came on the phone, croaky and exhausted. He’d saved their house but everything around them had burned. He said at one point there was fire 360 degrees around them. He’d walked into town and stood across the road as he watched Sally’s shop – with all her artwork – burn to the ground, along with his temporary office beside it. All their work was gone., The previous evening we’d visited Dad and Sally to see their newly built place and share a housewarming bottle of champagne. There were burnt leaves falling from the sky – but that was happening everywhere we’d been, and locals were hoping that a southerly wind would push the fire back. We nearly left the kids with them for the night but made plans to go back to stay for New Year’s Eve., We evacuated from the caravan park to Narooma town, packing up using our phone torches as the sky got darker and redder. We were shown into the Narooma Police Citizens Youth Club, given a gym mat and settled in. Generators powered a light inside. People were coughing in the smoke, wearing masks. Volunteers were handing out tea and coffee and biscuits, more volunteers were cooking food donated by locals. The prawn seller across the road was handing out prawns – he was about to lose $3,000 worth of them through the lack of refrigeration., A Rural Fire Service worker told us Narooma was cut off, without power or internet coverage, that everything was chaos as RFS crews were broken up along the coast amid road closures. My phone coverage was gone. My wife, Gwenno, still had some. But the kids and most people around us were positive and patient, helping one another out, handing around food. I watched one family come in and sit on the floor, both parents haunted, tears running down their cheeks, their teenage boys standing over them looking lost. After a while they left., As day started to turn to night, we were told the road to Moruya had been temporarily opened. My friend Felicity, who I’d worked with a bit, had a house up there – she was there with her husband and son and another family. They had no power and no running water but if we could get north to Moruya we would have beds. We made the decision to drive. It was the most terrifying drive of my life – through dark red haze, trees smoking around us, dead wildlife along the sides of the roads. I didn’t know whether to go fast to get through quicker or slow to avoid danger if it turned up on the road. I did both intermittently, as the kids breezily suggested chips and listening to the Beatles. We reached the house to cheers from the two families there. They were workmates I was very fond of – but we’d never even been for dinner together and I’d barely met their spouses. They welcomed us in and the kids presumed to treat them like family. They had been evacuated that morning at 6am but allowed to return home. We were all feeling a bit rattled, and smashed a few glasses of wine in the candlelit darkness. At midnight we whispered happy new year and hugged. The next morning was Felicity’s son’s birthday. I was hungover, feeling as though I’d smoked several packs of cigarettes. We ate dry cereal and homemade bread cooked on the barbecue. I walked down to the tank away from the house to refill our water supplies., Later we went down to the beach, walking the sand with the birthday boy, getting to know him and like him, the kids asking every inappropriate kid question to discover his life story. We were the only people on the beach, enveloped in smoke haze. Helicopters flew overhead – a Blackhawk, several rescue helicopters – one carrying water for the fires. Our son waved up at them and they sounded sirens in greeting, hands waving down at us. That night we celebrated the birthday boy with a candlelit dinner of bream and salmon we caught off the beach and salad from the garden and wines just under room temperature from having been kept in the fast-thawing freezer. And then the power came back on! We screamed and laughed. The birthday boy had been given a bunch of seven-inch records as presents, mostly 80s classics, and he put them on loud as people got up to dance., The next morning authorities were telling everyone to leave if they could. Many people couldn’t because, with the power out, there was no fuel to be had. And if you could get fuel you could only pay for it with cash, but ATMs weren’t working. And then the fuel ran out. But again we were lucky; we had cash and fuel. We packed up to go as fast as we could, helping to fireproof the house a bit. I wished I could have stayed and helped more. But all agreed if the roads were opened my family should get out. I fell in love with everyone in that house, so grateful and relieved was I to have been given somewhere safe and warm and fun to shelter while the world fell apart up and down the coast., For 90 minutes we did less than 20km/h but the sensation of actually moving on a highway was wonderful, We set out north. From Moruya we took a back road up by the beaches past burnt trees, burnt villages, burnt animals. What would normally have been an hour-long drive to Ulladulla took five hours. The highway was choked with people trying to escape. And then it was announced that the highway north had been closed again due to a fire and fallen trees across the road. Thousands of cars were backed up, with the radio saying a night sleeping in the car was a possibility. There were conflicting messages coming from officialdom, most of what anyone could find out was from people calling in to ABC radio. We went into the Ulladulla Woolies, getting what we could from the fast-emptying shelves. All the fresh fruit and most of the vegies were gone. And nearly all the water. As we idled in the car on the Ulladulla high street, Gwenno cut rolls out the window to make lunch for us., Someone came running over. It was an old work colleague from her previous job, a German guy, who happened to be walking by. Gwenno had no idea he was in the area. He was stuck, like us, with his young family. He told us another ex-work colleague of Gwenno’s had a family holiday house in Mollymook and he’d managed to track down a key. If we needed, both families could stay there the night., Google Maps and Live Traffic indicated an alternative route home to Sydney – but it was over the mountains towards Braidwood, where catastrophic fires had been burning for weeks, and would turn a three-hour drive into an eight-hour journey. But it was 2pm and we just wanted to get home so we decided to try it. The alternative route took us across the intersection at Milton – the last point where the highway had been closed – and we realised we’d now ended up at the front of the queue. If the highway was going to open, even temporarily, we’d have a chance of getting through. Gwenno called the traffic hotline, which warned us not to take the alternative route under any circumstances. It was largely dirt roads and the fire situation was unknown. So we sat tight, listening to radio updates and lying on our picnic blanket reading, watching the 18-month-old boy in the car behind us toddle around, followed by his patient young parents., They dropped by our car and we traded information. She had a brother-in-law who worked in sanitation for Eurobodalla shire – he’d warned the council that if the power were cut the drinking water supply could be compromised and disease could break out. They’d brought in some generators from Newcastle but they hadn’t worked. A local woman came by handing out water for everyone trapped in the line. Later, as it got on towards 7pm, she brought homemade sausage rolls and tomato sauce for everyone for dinner. Another couple brought pieces of zucchini fritter. Another woman and her son brought tea. Another young woman walked her pony around so the kids could pat it. I told her about what had happened to my dad and Sally in Cobargo and she said she’d seen a picture of them in a news story. Her father-in-law had a similar story – he was renovating a new country home, with everything he owned stored in two shipping containers in a paddock. Both containers had burned, destroying everything., The radio told us the police were going to start escorting cars up the burnt highway, 100 at a time. There was a flurry of movement, we edged forward 20 metres then stopped. Nothing happened for half an hour. Then the bloke towing a boat in front of me came back to say he was in communication via two-way radio with a mate who was working on the roads up the highway – the fire had got away from them, the decision had been made, they were calling it. The road would be shut for hours more. It was 10pm., Gwenno’s old workmate came by; he had the key to the place in Mollymook. We headed down there and shared a warm beer as he and Gwenno caught up on what was happening in the business she’d left. I woke at 5am, looking out over the stunning view of Mollymook beach I hadn’t realised was there when we’d arrived in the dark. We got the sleepy kids out of bed, packed them into the car and drove. For 90 minutes we did less than 20km/h but the sensation of actually moving on a highway was wonderful., And now I’m home. I feel great personal sadness for everything my dad and Sally have lost. But they still have their home and their lives. I feel a broader sadness for everyone down the south coast who has lost so much more. And I fear what is still to come for the area. I’m angry and frustrated and a bit hopeless at the lack of leadership and refusal to come to grips with what’s driving this catastrophe, and that with the onslaught of worsening climate change this is going to become a kind of new normal. I’m in tears. But I’ve also been overwhelmed by the love and generosity and goodwill and plain fucking human decency I’ve seen and experienced during this crisis., • Timothy Lee is a writer based in Sydneytrapped by bushfires on the nsw south coast my young family saw the very best of humanity", "label": 0}, "train-62": {"text": "\nAustralian PM Scott Morrison agrees to permanently increase aerial firefighting funding\n, Prime minister says up to $20m to be made available to lease four extra planes with additional funding for National Aerial Firefighting Centre, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nFri 3 Jan 2020 22.46 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Jan 2020 22.58 EST\n\n, The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the federal government will agree to a request made 18 months ago to permanently increase funding to boost Australia’s aerial firefighting capacity., As Australia’s unprecedented bushfire crisis continues, the availability of large air tankers to supplement smaller aircraft has come under the spotlight., On Saturday afternoon, Morrison announced that up to $20m would be made available to lease four extra planes – two long-range fixed-wing DC-10s with 30,000 litres capacity and two medium-range large air tankers with an 11,000 litre capacity., Morrison also confirmed that $11m payments to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre – made to top up the centre in 2018 and 2019 – would “go into this year’s budget on an ongoing basis”., In May 2018, the NAFC sent the government a business case requesting a permanent increase of $11m to its annual budget., Guardian Australia has seen a copy of the summary of the business case, which is currently with David Littleproud, the minister responsible for emergency management., The business case shows the annual costs of leasing aircraft and coordinating that NAFC have been rising due to inflation, but the contribution from the federal government has remained the same., On Saturday morning, the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said: “We haven’t seen a positive response to that business case.”, The NAFC – which works coordinates aerial firefighting across all states and territories – asked the federal government for an extra $11m a year, on top of the existing $14.8m a year budgeted in the five years to 2017-18., The $11m annual request in funding included:, $1.1m a year to make up for losses from inflation, and a new clause that future cash would be index-linked, $2.2m to make up for losses due to unfavourable foreign exchange rates that affected overseas leasing agreements, $7.5m to support leasing of aircraft that would be matched by other states and territories, $1.6m over three years to develop a risk management model to improve decisions on where aircraft should be deployed, The government had provided two ad hoc payments to the centre of $11m in 2018 and 2019 but had not made the payments permanent., Fitzsimmons said the national sharing arrangements “work very well” but added: “What we need is certainty around the funding going forward so we can secure better economies of scale and certainty around what we’ve got here and how we’re sharing it going into the future.”, The chief executive of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council, Stuart Ellis, told Guardian Australia he did not know why the proposal had been left unresolved for so long. The council is responsible for the NAFC., Ellis said the federal government’s NAFC budget had not been adjusted for inflation and other cost rises since 2004, and part of the proposal was to recoup these losses., He said: “The reason the business case was put forward as an ongoing contribution by the Commonwealth is that we can then get the best possible deal, because you then have a long-term commitment for the large air tankers over three to five years.”, The largest chunk of the extra funding request – the $7.5m to lease aircraft – was mostly to cover the “standing costs” of having the aircraft on the ground and available., He said the daily costs of operating the aircraft were paid for by whichever state was using them at the time., The business case said the proposal would deliver $7.1m in net benefits every year, “through procurement staff and service provider cost savings”., “We want the funds in advance because we can then achieve a lot more with it, rather than getting it in the midst of a fire season”, it said., But Ellis warned that large air tankers were “not a panacea” to the current bushfires., “If we wanted another 10 aircraft, we could get another 10. But it won’t solve the problem. There’s a large promotion of them within the industry, but it won’t stop these fires.”, He said California was able to deploy 30 large aircraft, but that had not stopped the loss of properties in fires there in recent years.australian pm scott morrison agrees to permanently increase aerial firefighting funding", "label": 0}, "train-63": {"text": "\nAustralia bushfires: fire chiefs update dire situation in NSW and Victoria – video\n, The fire chiefs from New South Wales and Victoria have both given briefings amid the day's dire weather predictions.

And then there’s the small matter of the $14.6m Coalition budget cut to manage this year., “We have a budget and what we do is reorganise,” Whelan told Guardian Australia., Having just emerged from bushfire areas, the importance of @abcnews updates on the radio can not be understated. The message to get out is critical but “how” you do it is essential. Sometimes a GPS just doesn’t cut it. #NSWfires, “There’s no way we are going to economise on emergency broadcasting. That is our No 1 priority. And so we do have to make some choices about what we might do or not.”, Despite the overwhelming praise for local radio in regions such as Gippsland and the Illawarra, News Corp papers have continued to publish articles critical of the ABC, a decision which has been jarring for many who are relying on the national broadcaster in a time of crisis., The Australian has run opinion pieces critical of ABC programming and confected news stories blaming the ABC for the performer Tex Perkins giving Scott Morrison the finger during the New Year’s Eve broadcast. Familiar ABC critics, including the former ABC chairman Maurice Newman and the Liberal senator Eric Abetz, were lined up to pour scorn on the ABC, even as its news reporters put in long hours to cover the disaster., The ABC is currently helping save lives and properties. Just don’t. https://t.co/b9N9cYJTQf, One of the hosts of those emergency broadcasts, the 702 drive presenter Richard Glover, came back from annual leave on New Year’s Eve when local radio decided to drop its national summer programming for NSW-specific coverage. Glover said ABC emergency radio provided a vital service., Just emerged from days of hell on sth coast, cannot believe attacks on ABC, It is the ONLY reliable source of info, everyone is tuned in, its real time broadcasting is saving lives, property and helping us understand our situation re fire threats, roads, petrol, food etc, “When it’s at emergency level you really need rolling coverage so people can ring up and say ‘the road is closed’ or ‘if you can’t get a mobile phone call through to your mum don’t panic because the lines are down’,” Glover said., “A few people always ask ‘why are you doing this?’ because of course people can just look up the information on the RFS emergency services sites., “The first answer is, as we’ve seen on south coast this week, people lose power and mobile phone coverage and the only thing you’ve got left is a battery-operated transistor radio or a radio in the car., “And the second answer is that people can share information. It’s a really good spot for people to share information which they have very actively been doing.”, Good thread about the importance of local ABC knowledge in times of emergency. https://t.co/lDLPx0PMvq, To my calm, factual and diligent colleagues in ABC radio, news and television you are doing a brilliant job. You were our guide through a smoking labyrinth of burnt and closed roads. ABC emergency broadcasting is a precious national resource. #AustralianFires @abcmelbourne, Glover’s own mud-brick house, which he built by hand decades ago at Wombeyan Caves, was still “very much under threat” as he volunteered to host the afternoon shift again on 702 on Saturday., “Everyone feels it’s a privilege to be able to help in any way they can,” he said., Whelan said Glover was not the only staffer to volunteer to come back to work. The new Q&amp;A host, Hamish Macdonald, has been anchoring the TV news from Bega, and spent New Year’s Eve doing live crosses while on holiday in the region., Whelan said a great deal of planning went into preparing for Saturday’s coverage of the dire conditions, including contingency plans if the transmitters burned down and for the safety of staff covering the disaster., After Cyclone Yasi hit Queensland in 2011, the former ABC managing director Mark Scott created an emergency broadcasting policy, in consultation with the Bureau of Meteorology and Australian fire and emergency authorities, Whelan said. The policy commits the ABC to issue all watch and act and emergency warnings and to undertake recovery broadcasting. There is no specific funding for these roles., Whelan said the emergency broadcasting division used to run for just six months of the year during bushfire season but in the past few years the ABC has had to extend it to the entire year. A small group of staff liaises with the emergency services, sends alerts to the radio stations and advises management of any need to escalate., Macdonald, who has just joined the ABC full time to replace Tony Jones, said he had sprung into action on New Year’s Eve when he woke to text messages from friends saying he should evacuate immediately while on holiday in Tathra. He found himself at the Bega emergency centre and started doing live crosses on ABC radio., “Very quickly the news operation swung into action and I was doing reports for the 7pm news from the showground and I filed a piece for digital,” Macdonald told Guardian Australia. “A lot of people came up and wanted to chat because I am from Jindabyne and a lot of people know my dad.”, Macdonald returned briefly to Sydney and had to coordinate the evacuation of his 80-year-old father on Friday., “Obviously the ABC is the place people turn to in these moments and you want to be able to contribute in any way you can,” Macdonald said., “The local news team here at Bega are just extraordinary. There are two young multiskilled journos, Adriane Reardon and Daniel Doody, and they shoot, they do radio, TV, digital., Cooler and calmer conditions across the Far South Coast got us like👍👍👍 @danieldoody101 #Bega #nswfires pic.twitter.com/53ccbOfZjZ, “Daniel moved down there with his wife, who is expecting.

After Saturday’s atrocious conditions, the NSW south coast town of Eden became the latest locus of the rolling crisis that has torn through great swaths of the east coast. Desperate residents, holidaymakers and refugees from surrounding communities sought refuge on the town’s wharf until authorities said even there was unsafe. “It has to change something, doesn’t it?” Shelley Caban told Guardian Australia on Sunday, unsure of whether her home outside Eden still stood. “I really, really hope it does. The spiral can’t keep going like this.”, Almost 1,500 properties are confirmed to have been destroyed in NSW alone in the past month. The worst-affected areas on Saturday included Batlow, a small village in the foothills of the Snowy Mountains, where a man died of a heart attack while attempting to protect a friend’s property. In the southern highlands, south-west of Sydney, homes were destroyed in Kangaroo Valley and Wingello. In Victoria, where dozens of blazes continue to burn, 18 communities remain cut off, including Mallacoota, where residents had to be evacuated by the navy.

My dad used to say he’d like to sit there one night by the fire, and see who might come from the shadows to join him. That’s how strong their presence is in that quiet place. I want to hope the midden is intact, but unlike the prime minister I don’t believe in miracles.

The spiral can’t keep going like this.”, After communities across the state’s south coast were struck by fierce blazes on New Year’s Eve, authorities had warned that blistering temperatures and strong gusting winds on Saturday could make for even worse conditions., They were right., At least 60 homes have been confirmed destroyed by fires that ripped through NSW on Saturday, though that total is expected to rise once Rural Fire Service crews are able to properly inspect the fire grounds., It brings the total number of properties destroyed in this state since bushfires gripped more than a month ago to 1,400., The worst-affected areas on Saturday included Batlow, a small village in the foothills of the state’s Snowy Mountains, where homes were destroyed and a man died of a heart attack while attempting to protect a friend’s property., In the southern highlands, south-west of Sydney, homes were destroyed in Kangaroo Valley and Wingello after embers from the Currowan fire crossed the Shoalhaven River and sparked fires in the dense bushland on the river’s northern banks., In Victoria, where dozens of blazes continue to burn, 18 communities remain cut off, including Mallacoota, where residents had previously had to be evacuated by the navy after a previous round of fires tore through., The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has promised an aid package for areas ravaged by the crisis and said on Sunday he would consider a royal commission into the deadly blazes, which have burned vast areas on the east coast., Morrison, who has been heavily criticised for taking a holiday in Hawaii during the crisis and was heckled by locals in Cobargo after forcing a handshake on an unwilling woman, also again defended his leadership during the emergency., In the small fishing and logging town of Eden, near the NSW and Victoria border, hundreds of people huddled at the wharf on Saturday night as a large and uncontained fire driven by gusting southerly winds raced towards the town., By Sunday morning, conditions remained dire, and police began pleading with people to flee north to the town of Merimbula or west to Bega., In Merimbula, about 27km north, an evacuation centre has reached capacity and shanty towns have emerged along the water. Among them was Rodney Sargent with his girlfriend, Jaymi Herman., The couple had driven almost 2,500km south from Townsville in Queensland with their dog, Rex, to meet Sargent’s father, Alan, who had come 4,000km across the country from Western Australia to meet for a holiday in Eden., Now they’re stuck., “It wasn’t the holiday we were expecting,” Sargent told the Guardian. “We can’t get any phone service and we’re pretty much out of fuel. We’re just waiting here. You feel pretty lost. I just want to get out of this entire state as quickly as possible.”, Despite the urging of police to leave Eden, many decided they were safer in the town near water., On Saturday night, as the fire approached, Matt Proctor, a fisherman, took his partner and two children on to his dinghy and took shelter in a harbour near the town. In pitch black and surrounded by acrid smoke, they tried to wait it out as relentless gusting winds buffeted them and ash rained from the sky., “It was apocalyptic,” Proctor told the Guardian. “Like end of the world stuff.” Eventually they took shelter in one of two tugboats at the town’s wharf along with dozens of other people who had fled to the water., “It was tense, it was eerie, you know it’s the safest place to be but we didn’t sleep much. It’s been chaos here not just today but for days and days. We thought New Year’s Eve was the worst we’d ever see. Little did we know. It plays with your mind a bit. Eden is such a beautiful place to live and now we’ve lost so much.”, Easing conditions later on Sunday enabled RFS crews to bring the fire under control, and the town itself remains intact. But authorities say places to the south including the Nethercote Valley where Caban and her family live remain under threat., Not long before she spoke to the Guardian on Sunday, she received a call from neighbours who told her the house was under threat from embers., “It’s heartbreaking,” she said. “It was our dream to own a beautiful home like this. I know I will cry a lot if we lose it.”paradise lost locals flee eden as australia bushfires race towards them", "label": 0}, "train-69": {"text": "\n'We realised we can't stop this': locals flee Wingello fires inferno that smashed NSW village\n, Residents of sleepy southern highlands town recall a roaring wind, like a freight train, then seeing red sky and embers raining down , \nHelen Davidson in Wingello and \nChristopher Knaus, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 08.12 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Sun 5 Jan 2020 03.21 EST\n\n, When the sky turned an angry red and the wind roared like a freight train, David Bruggeman knew it was time to flee., Bruggeman’s place was among the first in Wingello, a sleepy village in the southern highlands region of New South Wales, to meet the fire front that tore in from bushland to the south on Saturday night., He and other residents thought they would only face ember attacks from the distant Currowan fire, burning on the opposite side of the Shoalhaven River., They were instead confronted by an inferno., “I thought ‘oh my goodness’. I said ‘we’ve got to go’,” he said., What firefighters had feared for days had come to pass. Once the fire jumped the river, it grabbed hold in the dramatic and dense bushland of Moreton national park., It lit up forests to Wingello’s south, creating a new bushfire that tore northwards, out-of-control, flamed by strong winds., “When the southerly hit, that’s when things really got interesting. It formed pyro clouds. One had formed earlier in the day, but it formed three,” Peter Lockerby, the RFS head of the Bundanoon Wingecarribee district, said., “That means only one thing – the fires are moving quickly and burning profusely., “It took a run of about 12km in two hours, which is just ridiculous. We have seen it before this season, up north, but we never thought for a second we’d experience it down here.”, The fire split into two flanks, one to the north hitting Bundanoon and Exeter, and a southern point smashing Wingello, roaring through the state forest with “amazing speed”, catching Forestry firefighters in an overrun which they were able to escape from., “One moment it was darkness, and then it was dark red,” Lockerby said., In town, Bruggeman’s plan to stay and fight quickly became futile., “We heard this huge noise, like a freight train, then the red sky, all these embers raining down ... that’s when we realised ‘we can’t stop this’ and retreated,” he told the Guardian., Bruggeman fled to the general store he has owned and run for 11 years, a building that also serves as Wingello’s post office., Within 20 minutes, the flames caught up. The fire approached the store’s backyard., He piled seven of his kids, his mother and father-in-law, and two friends into a van, and the family again fled, this time leaving town entirely for the relative safety of the Mittagong RSL, where they stayed during the horrors of last night., Around him, Bruggeman watched an apocalyptic scene. Homes were in flames all around him., “We watched all these fires breaking out all across Wingello,” he told the Guardian., “We got the chance to escape, out by the main road, and we looked behind us and thought ‘we’ve lost everything’. We were actually quite happy just to be alive.”, Wingello has known fires before. The town’s name is said to derive from an Indigenous language term meaning to “to burn”. Bushfires destroyed houses and killed residents in 1965, and threatened the town again in 1998., On his way out of town, Bruggeman took a picture of the inferno he was leaving behind and posted to Facebook., “Unless there is some stupendous miracle that defies any reason, we have lost the house and the shop. We fully expect to return to ashes where the house and shop now stand.”, The morning brought with it extraordinary news. His son went into town and reported back that both the store and the home had somehow survived., “He took a photo of the backyard of the shop ... not one blade of grass is blackened. The next door neighbours had a destroyed backyard, and across the road had a destroyed backyard, but our little block there somehow survived,” he said., “So we’re just amazed.”, Scott Maddox, who helps run Wilmotte cottage, a small bed and breakfast in the picturesque village, had left nothing to chance, making sure he was out of the area well in advance. He said information from the town had been limited, but said he’d been assured his place was safe. “Our place is still standing,” he told the Guardian., Many people in Wingello, Bundanoon and Penrose had left much earlier to avoid any risk of being trapped by the fire, and on Sunday the highlands villages were like ghost towns. Smoke hung heavy on the road, obscuring any columns which might indicate a blaze was nearing., But the weather and the quiet were incongruous to the massing of trucks and firefighters at Wingello station., On the corner of the next block a property was laid waste, a smoking reminder of what could come again. Among the charred rubble and cars, blackened vines wrapped around a still standing chimney., At what seemed to be the former front entrance, some bricks were still blonde and statues stayed upright. The red number 75 shone from the blue column next to stairs that now go nowhere., North of tiny Wingello and even tinier Penrose, Klaus Elber was staying on Sunday to defend as the fire continued to burn. It was just him and the bushland property he’s spent so many years building and perfecting., He’s a former RFS volunteer, and had cleared as much as he can. , If that’s not enough, he’s built a bunker. There’s a few around, but his is pretty rudimentary. The old diesel tank buried under two feet of dirt, with a sealable air vent and stairs leading down to the door. It’s not pretty, it’s not comfortable, but come a fire front, it’s liveable, he says., “It’s better than a wombat hole,” he said.we realised we cant stop this locals flee inferno that smashed nsw village of wingello", "label": 0}, "train-70": {"text": "PM announces recovery effort in fire crisis that has 'months to go' – as it happened, This blog is now closed, \nChristopher Knaus and \nAmy Remeikis, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 07.39 EST\n\n\n\nFirst published on Sat 4 Jan 2020 15.03 EST\n\n\n, \n\n3.22am EST\n03:22\n\n, Time for a quick wrap up of what we’ve learned today. , Thanks again for sticking with us.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. , The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk., Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. , Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past., The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970., Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists., NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning.

The National Parks and Wildlife Service senior executive was named the local recovery coordinator to support islanders as they come to grips with their needs over the coming weeks and months., “This is an unprecedented tragedy for the Kangaroo Island community, who are now facing a recovery effort on a scale never seen before on the island,” the SA human services minister, Michelle Lensink, said., “His appointment recognises the unique challenges facing Kangaroo Island as it embarks on the process of recovery, including geographic isolation, losses relative to population, impacts on local economic activity and community wellbeing.”, with Australian Associated Presskangaroo island fires farmers shoot injured sheep after unfightable bushfire ravages sa island", "label": 0}, "train-73": {"text": "\nExplainer: how effective is bushfire hazard reduction on Australia's fires?\n, Claims of a Greens conspiracy to block hazard reduction have been rejected by bushfire experts, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 23.18 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 18.32 EDT\n\n, Australia’s bushfire crisis started much earlier than normal in August 2019, with thousands of fires in Queensland and New South Wales., Despite the evidence a claim persists that a major contributing factor of Australia’s devastating fire season – and the deaths, loss of homes and environmental devastation they have caused – is not climate change but a conspiracy by environmentalists to “lock up” national parks and prevent hazard reduction activities such as prescribed burning and clearing of the forest floor., On Saturday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said after visiting fire grounds: “The most constant issue that has been raised with me has been the issue of managing fuel loads in national parks.”, He claimed that people “who say they are seeking those actions on climate change” could also be the same people who “don’t share the same urgency of dealing with hazard reduction”., Prof David Bowman, the director of the fire centre research hub at the University of Tasmania, said: “It’s ridiculous. To frame this as an issue of hazard reduction in national parks is just lazy political rhetoric.”, On Sunday Morrison said he wanted to know “what the contribution of issues” around hazard reduction were, but repeated that it had been an issue raised often with him., He also said “without the planning, without the preparations” of state agencies, “I fear what has really been a terrible tragedy would have been far worse.”, Hazard reduction is the management of fuel and can be carried out through prescribed burning, also known as controlled burning, and removing trees and vegetation, both dead and alive., Hazard reduction is carried out by fire authorities, national park staff and individual property owners who can apply for permits to clear areas around their buildings. Coordination of activities happens through local bushfire management committees. There are 120 committees in NSW., The claim of a conspiracy by environmentalists to block hazard reduction activities has been roundly rejected by bushfire experts, and experts say it is betrayed by hard data on actual hazard reduction activities in national parks., Prof Ross Bradstock, the director of the centre for environmental risk management of bushfires at the University of Wollongong, has previously told Guardian Australia: “These are very tired and very old conspiracy theories that get a run after most major fires. They’ve been extensively dealt with in many inquiries.”, Former fire chiefs who have been calling strongly for action on climate change, and who have been trying to meet Morrison for months, have also been calling for increased funding for hazard reduction., The Australian Greens say they want “an effective and sustainable strategy for fuel-reduction management that will protect biodiversity and moderate the effects of wildfire for the protection of people and assets, developed in consultation with experts, custodians and land managers”., A federal government factsheet on bushfire management outlines how state agencies and people can carry out a range of hazard reduction activities that have been exempted from national environmental law, even if they “have the potential to have a significant impact on nationally protected matters”., In the last full fire season of 2018 and 2019, the National Parks and Wildlife Service in NSW told Guardian Australia it carried out hazard reduction activities across more than 139,000 hectares, slightly above its target., There are two major restricting factors for carrying out prescribed burning. One is the availability of funds and personnel, and the second is the availability of weather windows., The 2018-19 annual report of the NSW Rural Fire Service says: “The ability of the NSW RFS and partner agencies to complete hazard reduction activities is highly weather dependent, with limited windows of opportunity. Prolonged drought conditions in 2018-19 adversely affected the ability of agencies to complete hazard reduction works.”, The RFS said 113,130 properties had been subject to hazard reduction activities, which was 76% of its target. The 199,248ha covered was 106% of its target., A former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, Greg Mullins, has written that the hotter and drier conditions, and the higher fire danger ratings, were preventing agencies from carrying out prescribed burning., But as well as climate change narrowing the window to carry out prescribed burning, Mullins said some fires have become so intense they have burned through areas that had been subject to hazard reduction., Mullins has been fighting fires in NSW for months. Speaking to the ABC on Friday, he said he witnessed a fire in Grafton in an area that had burned only two weeks previously, but “the burnt leaves were burning again”., He said: “There has been lots of hazard reductions done over the years – more by national parks than previous years – but the fires have burned through those hazard reduction areas.”, Mullins dismissed suggestions that the bushfires were down to “greenies” preventing hazard reduction activities.“This is the blame game. We’ll blame arsonists, we’ll blame greenies,” he said., “When will the penny drop with this government?”, The National Parks Association of NSW’s president, Anne Dickson, has also responded to the attacks on environmentalists., In November 2019, she said: “The increasing intensity and frequency of fire is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity and natural landscapes. It may be politically expedient to pretend that conservationists exercise some mythical power over fire legislation and bushfire management committees, but it is not so., “Such wild and simplistic claims avoid the very real and complex challenges of protecting our communities and the healthy environments that support our quality of life.”, Bowman said that separate to the “lazy political rhetoric” of blaming environmentalists, there should be an examination of the benefits and limitations of hazard reduction., But he said there was also a reality to consider: “A lot of people are thinking that hazard reduction burning stops fire. It doesn’t, but what it does do is to try and change its behaviour., “But let’s say you embarked on the biggest fire reduction program the world has ever seen. What’s the budget for that? Who will pay for it. Of course there is a place for hazard reduction but if you have massive increases, where does the money come from? The reality is that you can’t treat everything.”, The 2019-20 bushfire crisis coincided with Australia’s hottest year on record. On a state level, NSW easily experienced its hottest year, with temperatures 1.95C above the long-term average, beating the previous record year, 2018, by 0.27C., Climate experts have said not all of that heat came from climate change, as two climate systems were also working to push up temperatures and fire danger., Fire authorities are guided on a daily basis on the risk of fires through the Forest Fire Danger Index, a combined measure of temperature, humidity, wind speed and the availability of dry fuel. Spring 2019 had been the worst year on a record going back to 1950 for bushfire risk., A 2017 study of 67 years of FFDI data found a “clear trend toward more dangerous conditions during spring and summer in southern Australia, including increased frequency and magnitude of extremes, as well as indicating an earlier start to the fire season”., A study of Queensland’s historic 2018 bushfire season found the extreme temperatures that coincided with the fires were four time more likely because of human-caused climate., On Sunday Morrison claimed the government had “always made this connection” between climate change and impacts on Australia’s weather., Advice shared with authorities around the country earlier this year from the National Environmental Science Program said: “These trends are very likely to increase into the future, with climate models showing more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires throughout Australia due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.”, There are also fears that large pulses of carbon dioxide emissions from Australia’s bushfires may not be reabsorbed through regrowth of forests as they have in the past., The fire season has seen several reports of bushfire-generated thunderstorms. Guardian Australia has reported that 2019 would likely be a “stand-out” year for storms known as “pyroCBs” that generate their own lightning and influence the atmosphere at heights of up to 15km., A study in 2019 published in the journal Scientific Reports found that adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere would create more dangerous conditions favourable to pyroCB events in the future, particularly for the southern parts of Australia.explainer how effective is bushfire hazard reduction on australias fires", "label": 0}, "train-74": {"text": "\nScott Morrison promises aid package for areas ravaged by Australia bushfires\n, Prime minister says communications breakdown left NSW fire authorities unaware army reservists called up, \nBen Butler, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 22.59 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Jan 2020 23.16 EST\n\n, The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has promised an aid package for areas ravaged by Australia’s continuing bushfire crisis and says he will consider a royal commission into the deadly blazes, which have burned vast areas on the east coast., Speaking during a press conference the prime minister also said there had been a breakdown in communications with New South Wales authorities that left the Rural Fire Service and their Australian Defence Force liaison unaware army reservists had been called up to help with the fire effort., Morrison, who has been heavily criticised for taking a holiday in Hawaii during the crisis and was heckled by locals in Cobargo after forcing a handshake on an unwilling woman, also defended his leadership during the emergency., He said he and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, would announce a financial aid package for farmers, small businesses and “others who engage in the rebuilding effort” on Monday, after it was approved by cabinet, and ruled out a bushfire levy to fund it., “We will be committing everything that is needed and more as it is required,” he said., He said he would consider a royal commission into the fires “in concert with states and territories”., “There are matters referred to about planning and building regulations and where people are allowed to build residences and in what circumstances and the land clearing arrangements, of course hazard reduction has been a constant refrain as I have been on the ground,” he said., “I also acknowledge the drought conditions can make that very difficult on occasion but we also know there have been many occasions where the hazard reduction has been actively resisted and that is something that we will have to learn from as well.”, This was an apparent reference to the idea, which has been described as a conspiracy theory, that green activism has stopped the practice of burning off during the winter., Morrison said he would not be “distracted” by criticism of his leadership during the crisis and the community expected him to concentrate on the needs of communities hurt by the blazes., “That is very much my focus is and that’s where it will continue to be, working closely with the states and territories, working closely with my ministers and the agencies, the defence forces, the recovery agency, to be led by Mr Colvin and ensuring they have the support they need,” he said., However, he said there had been “a breakdown in communications” that meant the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, wasn’t told about the reserves being called out., “And so there has been a subsequent conversation between myself and the premier and the minister of NSW and we have addressed any of those issues that arose from that,” he said., Morrison has previously portrayed the response to the bushfires as primarily a state responsibility, saying as recently as Thursday that he did not want state and federal governments “to be tripping over each other in order to somehow outbid each other in the response”., The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, also admitted to traveling overseas during the crisis, initially telling reporters she had been on holidays over Christmas, without saying where she had been., She said that she “spent time with my family over Christmas but throughout that time I can assure you that I have been regularly on the phone with the prime minister, with emergency management minister Littleproud constantly”., Asked directly if she was in Bali she said: “Yes I was.”, Defence force personnel have played a key supporting role in the firefighting effort, providing transport, logistics and other help to emergency services since early September., Over the weekend, navy ships evacuated more than 1,000 people from Mallacoota, in East Gippsland, and yesterday the federal government called up 3,000 army reservists to bolster the effort., The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. , The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk., Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. , Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past., The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970., Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists., NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work., Morrison claimed there was “no dispute in this country about the issue of climate change, globally, and its effect on global weather patterns, and that includes how that impacts in Australia”., “The government has always made this connection and that has never been in dispute,” he said., However, overnight the government backbencher Craig Kelly told the BBC there was “no link” between climate change and the fires., In November, the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, described people who drew a link between the fires and global heating as “inner-city raving lunatics”.scott morrison promises aid package for areas ravaged by australia bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-75": {"text": "\nScott Morrison says video ad on ADF deployment is not political but 'carries his message to Australians'\n, Australian Defence Association criticises prime minister’s post which uses the defence force as ‘just plain wrong’, \nJosh Taylor, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 22.33 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Jan 2020 22.45 EST\n\n, Scott Morrison has defended using a video on social media outlining the government’s actions in response to the bushfire crisis, saying it was not a Liberal party advertisement and was used only to inform the community., A video posted on the prime minister’s Twitter and Facebook pages on Saturday outlined the actions the Morrison government had taken in bringing in the Australian defence force, navy ships and other actions to help out the state agencies battling fires across the south-east coast of Australia., We’re putting more Defence Force boots on the ground, more planes in the sky, more ships to sea, and more trucks to roll in to support the bushfire fighting effort and recovery as part of our co-ordinated response to these terrible #bushfires pic.twitter.com/UiOeYB2jnv, The end of the ad contained an authorisation from “S. Morrison, Liberal Party, Canberra”., The Liberal National party in Queensland also paid money to advertise a post linked to the press release for the announcement on Facebook, according to Facebook’s page transparency information., The Australian Defence Association criticised the video, stating it was in breach of the non-partisan conventions restricting the use of the ADF in party political advertisements. The head of the ADA, Neil James, said it was “plain wrong”., “It’s simple: you don’t use the defence force for party political advantage,” he told Guardian Australia., “They put out a media release giving people all the information so you have to ask yourself what the purpose of the ad is, and the purpose is clearly party political advantage. And that is just plain wrong.”, On Sunday Morrison defended the use of the ad., “It’s important that I communicate what we are doing with the Australian people,” he said. “As much as we’d all like to only rely on the reporting of the media to get those informations out, I would also seek to carry that message directly to the Australian people to ensure they are aware of what we are doing.”, He claimed that this format of ad had been used for months with no objections., Most recently that format, including the authorisation and use of defence imagery, was used on 12 December, before the most recent flare-up of bushfires across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia., #BREAKING: Aerial firefighting efforts will get another $11m boost from the Federal Government today, to help combat these terrible #bushfires.

The enormous flank of the Currowan fire, and related blazes, was moving east. At its northern end, near Nowra, the fire generated its own thunderstorm., The change wasn’t even there yet., Australia’s bushfire crisis is a gruelling long-running catastrophe which is taking its toll on everyone.

Weinstein was charged with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013, officials said. The New York trial erupted into furious name-calling between lawyers, who decried each other’s behaviour as “abominable”, “degrading” and “humiliating”. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to five counts, of which the most serious is predatory sexual assault, carrying a maximum sentence of life., The massive influx of donations after the bushfires poses a “nice challenge” for the Rural Fire Service, Shane Fitzsimmons says, as questions begin to be asked about the distribution of funds. The NSW fire chief pledged to spend the extraordinary influx of money, now into the tens of millions of dollars, “where it was intended”. But Michael Eburn, an expert in emergency management at the Australian National University, said while donating to the RFS was commendable, the public should be clear that the organisation was a government-funded and run agency. “The RFS is not an organisation run by volunteers and funded by community donations,” he wrote. “The RFS is not a volunteer organisation, it is a government organisation that relies on volunteers.” On Monday Scott Morrison announced that at least $2bn would be spent on bushfire recovery as the government stepped away from its pledge to deliver a budget surplus amid the crisis., The Cobargo post office has been turned into an animal rescue centre, writes Michael McGowan, as local residents are left numb by the devastation wrought on their homes by fires.

Why do we deserve that?”, Moser and Wilson have not been entirely lucky. The couple moved here from Sydney four years ago to start a new life together running the post office. After the weekend’s fire, it has become their home., On Monday they take the Guardian to see what was left of their house in neighbouring Wandella., While they feed the sheep, cows and goats that miraculously survived the blaze amid the rubble of what used to be their home, they explain how they watched in the early hours of New Year’s Eve as the fire approached their town., “It was terrifying,” Moser says. “I never thought I’d be involved in a bushfire – and never again, hopefully. It was just so scary. I just packed the car. Dave did want to fight it in the beginning but we were worried about getting out. There’s only one road in here.”, With their four dogs they headed for the nearby seaside town of Bermagui, which, by 10am, was “pitch black” from smoke. The rumour mill there was in overdrive. They were told the post office had gone, that the whole town was gone., When they returned home a few days later, they found the remains of their house., “I was just numb,” Wilson says. “I think your body just sort of shuts down. I still don’t think we’ve really processed it yet. I’ve literally just found out that we’re covered by insurance and I just feel flat.

A 71-year-old man was found at his property in Nerrigundah, a tiny village about an hour north of Cobargo., What happens to people like Moser and Wilson after the initial crisis has passed? “That was my first thought. My initial thought was, like, what’s next?,” Moser says. “Like, what happens now? I still don’t know.”, It has been a week since a father and son, Robert and Patrick Salway, died fighting the same fire at their home in neighbouring Coolagolite., The blaze destroyed dozens of homes and businesses in Cobargo and the surrounding district, and the village became the subject of international focus after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was heckled during a visit., But after the spotlight moves on to the next town in the fire’s path, life for many here has hit an impasse. The village remains without power and the local showground has become the shelter for a number of people left homeless., It has become a place to find information, get a place to stay, and pick up supplies at a donation stall better stocked than most local general stores., “I don’t even know where most of the donations are coming from any more,” Jess Collins says. “Things show up and are gone again before I know where they came from. Some guys from Jindabyne about 200km west dropped some stuff off before.”, Collins has been here most days since the fire hit. Though she grew up in Cobargo, she now lives about four hours north, in the town of Goulburn., She came home for Christmas to visit her father, and took shelter at the showgrounds when the hills around his home became engulfed by fire. “I’ll have to go home eventually but for now I just want to help,” she says.post office turned into animal rescue centre in charred australian village", "label": 0}, "train-82": {"text": "Another death confirmed as bushfires heap pressure on PM – as it happened, This blog is now closed, \nGraham Readfearn, \nNaaman Zhou and \nAmy Remeikis, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 04.56 EST\n\n\n\nFirst published on Sun 5 Jan 2020 15.57 EST\n\n\n, \n\n4.47am EST\n04:47\n\n, That’s all from our live bushfire blog for today.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. , The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk., Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. , Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past., The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970., Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists., NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work., The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said it was “too early to tell” what the full economic cost of the bushfires would be, but emphasised the government had never seen the surplus as an “end in itself”, despite it being a prominent feature of this year’s budget., Frydenberg said he would be meeting with the Australian Insurance Council, regulators and company chiefs on Tuesday to ensure insurance payments flowed to affected individuals as quickly as possible, with 6,000 payments totalling almost $400m already paid out., The treasurer also said the Australian Taxation Office had agreed to a two-month deferral for the tax obligations of people living in fire-affected areas, and banks were also assisting., “People should not be concerned about their tax affairs at this time,” he said., Earlier, Greg Mullins, who chairs the Emergency Leaders for Climate Change group, welcomed extra resources from the federal government, but said they had been snubbed when a request was first made in April., “It’s great to see things finally moving but I hope in the future this government will learn to listen to people on the front line,” Mullins said., He also criticised the government’s inaction on climate change, saying it was a “load of rubbish” that the Coalition was taking strong action, with its ability to meet the Paris emission reduction targets based on its earlier “weak” Kyoto targets., “I worry for my grandchildren, their grandchildren.

I attended a number of international conferences and countries do look to Australia for direction, for guidance and leadership. And I believe we should be showing leadership on the issue of climate change,” Bishop told Nine’s Today show., Morrison said his focus was on the $2bn package., “The government will continue to work to meet and beat the commitments we have made for emission reductions,” Morrison said, emphasising that Bishop was part of the cabinet that signed off on the Coalition’s policy., The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, supported the funding for the recovery agency, saying Labor had been calling for greater federal assistance., “It’s good that the government is now making a number of announcements that we have argued for, including the need for a national response, including the economic compensation for volunteer firefighters, including the upgrade of our aerial firefighting capacity, and the increased use of the defence force,” Albanese said.coalition pledges 2bn for bushfire recovery as it walks back from budget surplus pledge", "label": 0}, "train-85": {"text": "\nFires crisis: senior NSW Liberals angered by claim state refused offers of navy assistance\n, Gladys Berejiklian and fire service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons both rejected idea they had turned down offers of federal help , \nAnne Davies, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 23.51 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 20.08 EST\n\n, A serious rift has developed between senior New South Wales Liberals and prime minister Scott Morrison, over claims the state government rejected offers of navy ships to help with evacuations from south coast towns ravaged by bushfires., Senior Liberals told Guardian Australia that the premier Gladys Berejiklian was “heartbroken” over a report that she had rejected earlier offers of assistance., The claims were made over the weekend by Daily Telegraph columnist Sharri Markson, who said the premier had rejected the offer of navy ships to assist in last week’s evacuations., “While Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has readily made use of the ADF to help nearly 1000 stranded locals and tourists evacuate from Mallacoota, the NSW Government has knocked back countless offers of naval support from Canberra,” she wrote., Markson did not attribute the claims to any named person and said the prime Minister refused to comment. , In the Australian over the weekend, Morrison was quoted as saying: “There is a major evacuation that is happening in Victoria at the moment with the HMAS Choules,” he said., “There has been no request from NSW of a similar ADF support for an evacuation of that nature on the south coast, given that the roads are open.”, At a press conference on Monday, both Berejiklian and the NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, again unequivocally rejected that they had turned down offers of federal help., Asked if the prime minister was lying, Berejiklian said: “I will say this: in a state of emergency operations decisions are taken by the commissioner. It’s not for politicians to interfere., Fitzsimmons then followed up, saying: “The answer is simply ‘no’. There has been no offer of assistance that I am aware of that hasn’t been accepted,” he said., Senior NSW Liberals said they were “disgusted and embarrassed” that the federal government had chosen to deflect blame on to Berejiklian for the slow response from the federal government to the bushfire crisis., NSW transport minister and member for the south coast electorate of Bega, Andrew Constance, said last week Morrison got “the welcome that he probably deserved” when he was confronted by distraught locals in the fire-ravaged town of Cobargo., “I’d say this to the prime minister today: the nation wants you to open up the cheque books, help people rebuild their lives,” Constance, who was briefly unaccounted for while defending his Bega Valley home from bushfire on New Year’s Eve, said last week., Berejiklian has been on duty throughout the crisis, working closely with Fitzsimmons who is in charge of the disaster response. She has visited affected areas and provided resourcing when requested by the RFS., The RFS worked throughout last week to evacuate towns along the south coast from Eden to Jervis Bay after New Year’s Eve fires wreaked havoc and another heatwave last Saturday threatened a repeat of catastrophic conditions., The biggest challenge was opening roads from small beachside hamlets and the Princes Highway because the intense bushfires had made downed power lines and the threat of falling trees a major hazard., The rift is especially damaging for Morrison who was state director of the NSW Liberals before entering parliament., This article was amended on 6 January 2020. A previous version said Sharri Markson confirmed to the ABC that she had been briefed by the prime minister’s office.fires crisis senior nsw liberals angered by pms claim state refused offers of navy

tackle bushfires and failure to act would be ‘most serious dereliction of duty in our history’, The federal Labor MP Mike Kelly has called for a war-like national mobilisation effort to deal with the existential threat of climate change, warning that a failure to act would be the “most serious dereliction of duty in our history”., The member for the New South Wales electorate of Eden-Monaro, which includes huge areas of the NSW south coast and the Snowy Mountains where destructive bushfires continue to burn, has called for the federal government to establish a civil defence corps (CDC) that would operate as a national disaster response reserve, and said compulsory national service might be necessary., Arguing the capacity of volunteer personnel was already stretched, Kelly pointed to estimates from the Climate Council suggesting that by 2030 Australia will need double the current number of firefighters., “The current model of response will not be adequate or sustainable to deal with this,” Kelly wrote in a lengthy Facebook post., “The reality is that we are facing the kind of existential threat through climate change that demands the same sort of national mobilisation of will as we required in World War II.”, Stressing that his “concept paper” was a personal view and not Labor party policy, Kelly argued the new corps could follow the model of the Australian defence force reserves, and could be funded from a national disaster levy., “This CDC should encompass all existing volunteer organisations and would be a national resource that could be mobilised for any disaster,” he said., Under his proposal, members of the new force would be offered incentives after a set period of service, with Kelly suggesting a card be granted that provided similar perks to a seniors card., “Benefits could include concessional travel, reduced vehicle registrations and personal fire insurance charges, together with limited private medical and life insurance for injuries received during frontline firefighting,”, Incentives could also be offered to employers of CDC members, including potential payroll tax relief and payments made when the reserves were called to service., The commonwealth would pay tax-exempt remuneration to mobilised members., Kelly said that in his recent visits to Rural Fire Service centres in his electorate, he had been struck by the age of the volunteer fire service, saying there was a need to attract young people into service., He said if the CDC was unable to attract sufficient personnel, the government could also consider putting in place a “gap year” scheme or even consider establishing a compulsory non-military national service scheme., “This would require all high school graduates to be absorbed into the CDC on leaving school for perhaps a one-year period, after which they would be required to render service as required and attend refresher training annually up until the age of 40, after which continuing service would be voluntary,” he said., He said some would find the proposal “controversial”, but he wanted to trigger a national discussion that generated new ideas to deal with the climate change threat., “In any event the climate change projections we are looking at may leave no other choice, and we must talk about this now,” he said., “I believe the concepts I am presenting could be a valuable and rewarding experience for the young Australians involved and serve many other outcomes that would be of benefit to our nation.”, Until the creation of the proposed corp, Kelly warned, the Australian defence force would still be required at the current scale, but “much more efficiently and quickly than has happened”., He said while ADF personnel were not trained in firefighting, they could play a greater role, with the “fundamental skills of planning, management, deploying organised bodies of personnel … ingrained in the ADF.”, “There are many relevant skills and capabilities they can deploy under direction from the expert civilian authorities,” he said, citing assistance with evacuations, logistics support, earthmoving, bulk water carrying, transport and refuelling., Defence’s Landing Helicopter Dock vessels could also provide support where there were no ports, or where they were damaged, including modular hospital units and accommodation, vehicles, high-grade communications and air traffic control and large quantities of stores and vehicles., “The ADF has been providing air, naval and other support but much more was needed and possible,” he said., On Saturday, Scott Morrison announced a plan to deploy 3,000 army reservists to assist in the bushfire crisis, but came under fire for failing to communicate with the NSW Rural Fire Service about the plan and for launching a party-political ad promoting the effort.labor mp urges war like national mobilisation to tackle australias existential threat of climate crisis", "label": 0}, "train-87": {"text": "\nA weekend of

It was a party political advertisement, and deceptive, as it became a claim that the Liberal party, not the government and Australia’s own taxpayers were the ones putting ‘boots on the grounds’, sending navy ships and supplying masks.”, “That is atrocious not only because it was factually wrong, but because of its divisiveness.”, Brown, who is currently completing Transparency International’s national integrity system assessment of Australia, said all political parties must give support to fixing the culture and rules allowing political self-promotion., “Every new prime minister promises the nation they will govern for the whole nation, not just those who vote for them. But in a time of crisis, this rushed attempt to play ‘catch up’ with public trust has created the reverse impression across much of the nation.”, Morrison has defended the ad, saying he chose to publish the ad from his own office because following normal government advertising processes would have meant ‘problems of its own’., Advertising campaigns by the Australian government generally must comply with a framework of rules and guidelines, which, among other things, prevent the use of public funds for party political advertising., Before the government advertising framework was introduced in 2008, the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee recommended rules were needed to prevent the line between political and government advertising from being blurred., “The problem with government advertising arises when the distinction between legitimate government advertising for public policy purposes and political advertising for partisan advantage is blurred,” the committee said. “In other words, the problem arises when governments use taxpayer funds to gain political advantage through partisan promotion of their views or themselves, rather than to meet the genuine information needs of citizens.”, Morrison has denied the video was an advertisement, and rejected suggestions it was politically motivated., “It wasn’t a Liberal party-sponsored ad, it was authorised by me – I’m the leader of the Liberal party – that’s the only authorisation I can post on something that is posted on my page,” he said., “The same thing that applies to other politicians in Australia … it is simply complying with requirements of Australian law.”, But the University of Queensland politics and law expert Professor Graeme Orr said such material only required political party authorisations if they were deemed “electoral matter”., Orr said that excluded communications “whose dominant purpose is to educate … on a public policy issue, or to raise awareness of, or encourage debate on, a public policy issue”., But ... it only requires party authorisation if it's \"electoral matter\". From which his 2018 amends exclude 'Communications whose dominant purpose is to educate ... on a public policy issue, or to raise awareness of, or encourage debate on, a public policy issue' https://t.co/8BXsRNJDIo, Orr said the ad could voluntarily have been authorised to the Australian government, rather than the Liberal party., “Either the ad was rushed without legal advice, his MP allowance used, or someone wanted it to look like Lib Party paid,” Orr tweeted., We’re putting more Defence Force boots on the ground, more planes in the sky, more ships to sea, and more trucks to roll in to support the bushfire fighting effort and recovery as part of our co-ordinated response to these terrible #bushfires pic.twitter.com/UiOeYB2jnv, Brown said if the ad was truly designed to provide public information, Morrison could simply have authorised it as “Scott Morrison, Prime Minister of Australia” – not as a Liberal party product – and asked for it to be distributed it through government channels, not Liberal party ones., “If designed to skirt around the government advertising rules, then these rushed decisions raise serious integrity issues, because Australia’s rules for controlling deceptive political advertising are even more non-existent,” he said., “Many will simply judge the bushfire ad as offensive and politically immoral, but overall it confirms that when under pressure – just when leaders are struggling to restore some kind of trust – our integrity rules and processes are falling down because the confusion made it worse,” he said., “Added to the obvious ignorance or misjudgment of those who actually made and published the ad, the consequence was inaccuracy, politicisation and partisanship just at the moment where even the prime minister was probably trying desperately to rise above those goals., “This is a tragedy not just for bushfire victims, but for public trust in all the institutions we are hopefully now triggering to deal better with such disasters. We have to make sure integrity reforms in 2020 mean it can never happen again.”, The ad has also faced criticism from the Australia Defence Association, which objected to the use of the Australian Defence Force for politically motivated advertising., The ADA executive director, Neil James, said the ad was “plain wrong” and broke longstanding conventions on the use of the ADF in advertising., “It’s simple: you don’t use the defence force for party political advantage,” he told Guardian Australia., “They put out a media release giving people all the information so you have to ask yourself what the purpose of the ad is, and the purpose is clearly party political advantage.

It is a situation where governments are viewed as above the law and people who see no problem are the ones believing their “solution” is the correct one., In America, Donald Trump’s lawyers are currently arguing in the Senate impeachment trial that if the president does it then it is not illegal, and indeed if the president determines that something is in the national interest then he should do it. And given Trump regards his re-election as in the national interest, that means he is therefore able to do whatever he wishes to ensure that happens., It is a circular logicbut is also one that we have seen take root here in Australia., There has been a bit of a mad scramble to explain Scott Morrison’s actions over the summer. Surely a man who must be a political genius – or at least very good at winning elections – would be able to see the damage of his response to the bushfires and the sports rort., But why should we expect there to be a response to a problem from one who sees no error in the first place?, If you are someone who views climate change not as an actual issue that threatens our way of life but just as a political issue to be used come election time to scare voters about electricity prices, why would you respond to the bushfires any differently from how he has?, And if you are someone who views government grants not as an actual means to address community concerns but merely as an exercise of the power of incumbency, wherein governments are free to use the funds as they see fit for the good of the country, then if you view your re-election as for the good for the country, that is how you will use those grants., The argument being forwarded by the government that there was nothing wrong with the process undertaken by Bridget McKenzie because all the grants were given to eligible projects is of course a very Trumpian excuse., It sounds sort of fine but is actually nonsense., As an Australian I am eligible to be selected to represent us at the Tokyo Olympics, but I suspect there might be some eyebrows raised were I to be selected to run in the 1,500m given my times have been on a bit of a decline for the past 30 years and, to be honest, I am a few packets of chips this side of my best condition., Indeed the guidelines about entry times would see me fall well below that considered appropriate for selection., The “eligibility” line is a con. A rather less-than-slick attempt to convince Australians that the LNP did not view taxpayers’ funds as their own re-election war chest., And you might wonder why Scott Morrison continues to defend this scheme given “as dodgy as a Bridget McKenzie grant” will soon enter the Australian lexicon, but again, if your view is that it is up to governments to determine what is right and you also believe that if you deny wrongdoing for long enough the public will soon lose interest, then his approach is more than to be expected., This approach is also what you do when, as ABC’s Laura Tingle noted in her question this week to the prime minister at the National Press Club, the entire cabinet was complicit in the funding arrangement., As Tingle noted, given the timing of the election, cabinet in March last year approved a further $42.5m of funds to be distributed under the scheme despite, as the ANAO points out, the guidelines stated the money was for projects that had yet to commence work but which “were expected to be completed by 30 June 2019”., Add in that the timing of the election meant the government only had five weeks to distribute this money and you see very much the whole of cabinet up to its neck in this rort., Scott Morrison responded to this excellent question by answering, “Well, as the auditor general found, the rules were followed. Guidelines are separate issues.”, Ah yes, guidelines are not rules, they were just the entire basis by which sports clubs around the nation made their application and were then assessed. Totally irrelevant., And this leads to the next line of attack – one again fully patented by Donald Trump. Rather than admit impropriety you argue, as the Nationals’ leader, the attorney general and now the prime minister have all done, that public servants’ recommendations for funding can be ignored because politicians know better., The prime minister’s argument that the funding was about providing change rooms for girls has been found to be utterly disingenuous – given at least 12 applications for the building or upgrading of female change rooms were rejected despite receiving excellent scores from Sport Australia., At this stage, given the evidence of colour coding of applications by the minister’s office to denote the party which held the seat from where the application came, the complaints from Sports Australia about the politicisation of the process, the approval given to projects deemed unworthy, and the rejection of applications deemed superior, it is clear that this was political grift on a major scale., And what is the prime minister’s response? He suggests there may be more funding to come to those clubs that missed out. In effect, if you missed out on the electoral bribe last time, don’t worry, your turn will come., A perfectly Trumpian conclusion.morrisons twisted logic on the sports rort is perfectly trumpian and no surprise", "label": 0}, "train-91": {"text": "\nMan in the middle: Ken Wyatt on being caught between the Uluru statement and his party\n, Minister for Indigenous Australians says he has to manage expectations on all sides as he seeks to build a consensus on a voice to parliament, \nLorena Allam, \n\nSat 1 Feb 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2020 14.02 EST\n\n, Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt will this week announce the third and final group of people he has selected to build consensus on a voice to government, even as he accepts this approach is facing criticism from many quarters., “The first thing I have to manage is the expectation from our community,” Wyatt said. “And that is diverse across the nation, depending on what the issues are.”, I don’t have an issue with people who have a completely different and opposing view, “The other is the expectation of my own party. And then the expectation that Australia has, given that I’m the Indigenous person who sits in this portfolio and leads it., Speaking to Guardian Australia, Wyatt said he doesn’t mind being in the middle between Indigenous communities who want a voice entrenched in the constitution – after years of reports, inquiries and referendum council recommendations – and those in his own party who say they will oppose a “divisive” voice and voting “based on race”, no matter what form it takes., Key supporters of the Uluru Statement from the Heart reject the constitutional recognition he proposes as merely symbolism., “I don’t have an issue with people who have a completely different and opposing view,” Wyatt said. “That’s the beauty of our country, we can have a range of views. Hence if you look at the membership of all three tiers, it reflects that range of views, including some who were involved with the deliberations around the Uluru statement,” he said., Wyatt’s three-tier structure has Indigenous and non-Indigenous appointees who will develop models for how a voice to government might operate at a local, regional and national level., Contrary to the demands expressed in the Uluru statement from the heart, Wyatt wants to legislate the voice before any referendum on constitutional recognition., His senior advisory group, co-chaired by Marcia Langton and Tom Calma, will propose models for the voice by June., There was surprise at the inclusion of rightwing commentator Chris Kenny in the national group, but Wyatt said he wanted to hear from as wide a range of views as possible because “that’s society”., “And if we want to win now, if we want to achieve the outcomes I’m seeking, then I need a reflection of as wide range of views that I would find outside of Parliament House, in any community., “Then you can say, I’ve got a diverse group of Australians who have given me advice and believe that this is an acceptable way forward.”, This week, Wyatt will announce the membership of the the third tier of this consultation process: the regional and local level. , “And the regional voices could be cultural. So the Warlpiri people said to me, if you do a local voice, it has to be our cultural group. When I spoke with the Yolngu people and with Gumatj people, with Galarrwuy Yunupingu, they said, we’ve got clan leaders, so you should be shaping it on our clan leader structures.”, By focusing on people, then we will have a better outcome, “I’ll be saying to the regional and local voice, I don’t care what the models are. If they vary across the nation, then that’s healthy. One size does not fit all.”, Wyatt said addressing the “deplorable” rates of youth suicide and closing the gap were his key priorities., “The single challenge that is paramount is closing the gap and working with 50 peak organisations and my parliamentary colleagues, particularly cabinet colleagues.”, Last week Scott Morrison and several senior ministers – including the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, the deputy PM, Michael McCormack, and the education minister, Dan Tehan – met with Wyatt and the peak Aboriginal community organisations., They agreed on “priority reforms” including having greater Aboriginal involvement in decision-making and service delivery at a national, regional and local level. There was also a commitment to making sure “all mainstream government agencies and institutions undertake systemic and structural transformation to contribute to closing the gap”., “It was the first time in a long time that we’ve been in the cabinet room to talk about the best way forward for our people,” the convener of peak organisations, Pat Turner, said after the meeting. “This is not just business as usual.”, Turner said it was a step closer to “where decision-making is shared, and the expertise and experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is fully recognised”., Wyatt said the meeting was “fruitful”., “I made the point that every minister around the cabinet table has a responsibility for Indigenous people within their portfolios. The PM jumped in and said, we will all be ministers for Indigenous Australians. But he said, my minister Wyatt will lead the work that is needed. And that’s a telling comment. It reflects the fact we’re focusing on people, not the issues. By focusing on people, then we will have a better outcome.”man in the middle ken wyatt on being caught between the uluru statement and his party", "label": 0}, "train-92": {"text": "\nDon't hold your breath waiting for the truth on Bridget McKenzie's sports rort\n, Parts of freedom of information laws are frustrating and illogical and keep the public in the dark, Contact author, \n\nSat 1 Feb 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2020 14.02 EST\n\n, Want to know how Bridget McKenzie and her office administered the $100m in sports grants that are at the centre of a major scandal? Beyond the great work done by the auditor general, it’s going to be hard to find out., One of the side benefits of a ministerial reshuffle is that embarrassing documents generated in the minister’s former office get filed away in the national archives, beyond the reach of prying eyes., Journalists can use freedom of information laws to ask departments and agencies such as Sports Australia for documents, which include emails, texts and even WhatsApp messages. But by all accounts the agency was cut out of the final decision making., We could also ask the prime minister for documents because he remained prime minister after the election. But we cannot access emails or documents from McKenzie’s office when she was sports minister because she is now minister for agriculture, not sport., And if she is relegated to the backbench before question time on Wednesday, Labor won’t be able to ask her any questions either., This limitation of freedom of information laws is frustrating and illogical., The Guardian sought to test the limits of the FOI laws late last year over the grasslands affair which embroiled two federal ministers, Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg., Taylor, the former minister for cities (now energy and emissions reduction), has said he told the then environment minister (now treasurer), Frydenberg, of his personal and family interest in Jam Land, a company which is the subject of a compliance action by federal authorities for alleged illegal clearing of 30ha of native grasslands., A brief recap: Taylor owns a shareholding in Jam Land via his family investment company Gufee, as does his brother Richard Taylor, who is a director of Jam Land. Taylor declared Gufee in his pecuniary interest register but not Jam Land, so to find out about Taylor’s interest requires company searches., Last year Taylor’s shareholding became public when the Guardian revealed that in 2017 he had taken a particular interest in native grasslands laws that protect them because they are critically endangered. He was so concerned he asked Frydenberg for briefings from his bureaucrats., Taylor insisted this had nothing to do with a compliance action launched a few weeks earlier on a Jam Land property and that his interest in the grasslands listing was piqued by an unnamed Yass farmer who raised concerns., Bureaucrats, including compliance staff, attended a meeting with Taylor in March 2017. There are no notes., In fact Taylor says he disclosed his family interest to Frydenberg before the meeting, though the bureaucrats told the Senate they were not told of it by either Taylor or Frydenberg., “My obligation is to disclose to the parliament and to the prime minister,” Taylor said. “The minister, which was Josh Frydenberg at the time, was also aware, so there was no lack of disclosure and compliance on this.”, Frydenberg backed Taylor’s version of events the next day., “I became aware when he asked me for a meeting,” Frydenberg told Patricia Karvelas on ABC Radio National., “He was very upfront. And he said that there was a family company which was subject to a compliance issue. And that he had an indirect interest in that company. But he was seeking a meeting on the technical aspects of the listing and in those circumstances, as is appropriate, there would not be any discussion of the compliance issue.”, Given the sensitivity one would think there might be a record of this conversation, but under FOI we cannot gain access to any emails, notes or records of meetings where this disclosure might have been recorded because Frydenberg is no longer environment minister., When the Guardian requested documents under FOI we were were told it was not a valid request., “As this request seeks documents that relate to previous portfolio responsibilities, not to the treasurer’s portfolio responsibilities or the business or activities of his portfolio agencies, it is not a valid request under the FOI Act,” Frydenberg’s office said., “A request for documents relating to a minister’s previous portfolio responsibilities is not a request for an ‘official document of a minister’.”, Taylor’s office said: “The FOI Act applies to documents of an agency and official documents of a minister. There is no right of access under the act to documents held by a parliamentarian in their capacity as a member of parliament.”, Taylor’s staff refused to elaborate, but the argument appears to be that if Taylor discussed grasslands with Frydenberg he did so as the member for Hume and not as a minister., Therefore any documents, if they exist, are outside the scope of the FOI Act, which covers only “official documents of a minister”., The Guardian will now appeal to the Australian information commissioner – but don’t hold your breath. The understaffed office is taking close to a year to assign a case officer to FOI appeals, let alone decide them., Meanwhile, where have the records of former sports minister McKenzie and other former ministers gone?, Can we find out which MPs lobbied her in support of sporting clubs in their electorates? What did McKenzie say in reply? Were there instructions from the prime minister’s office about how she should administer the program? Did she keep Morrison informed?, Theoretically these ministerial records, including portfolio-related emails, tweets, WhatsApp messages, diaries, notes etc, must be sent to the national archives., A spokesman for the archives said that when a minister leaves office after a change of government or resignation, ministerial records, ie records made or received in connection with the minister’s ministerial responsibilities, must be provided., General Records Authority 38 (GRA38) says these include appointment diaries, final speeches and media statements, daily itinerary papers, official briefings, portfolio-related correspondence, subject files on portfolio business, official tweets and WhatsApp messages, and records of deliberations on official business., The spokesman said most ministers do not usually lodge their papers directly with the national archives and they must not destroy, otherwise dispose of, or alter a record when leaving office., Instead they usually send them to departments for safe keeping and review before they are deposited in the archives. Once delivered the Archives Act says they are generally not accessible for 20 years, and possibly longer if they raise security concerns., As fascinating as the sports rorts and grasslands saga are, the public will no doubt have forgotten by then., FOI clearly fails to provide the answers, which is why we need a federal integrity body with wide powers that can ask for documents, interview witnesses and make a call about whether an incident raises issues of ministerial conduct or something more serious., Without it, a reshuffle provides a perfect escape from the sort of accountability that the public expect., Anne Davies is Guardian Australia’s investigations editordont hold your breath waiting for the truth on bridget mckenzies sports rort", "label": 0}, "train-93": {"text": "\nMurray-Darling: thousands of fish have died in NSW in past two weeks\n, NSW government has received reports of fish kills at 13 locations in the catchment, and warn of more to come, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nSat 1 Feb 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 1 Feb 2020 14.02 EST\n\n, Thousands of native fish have died in a series of ongoing mass death events at more than 20 different locations across the Murray-Darling Basin and in coastal areas of New South Wales in the past two weeks., Government officials are warning of still more fish deaths to come, with heatwave conditions and then potential storms this weekend bringing further risk., Sporadic heavy rain in some parts, combined with drought conditions and ash and exposed soil running into waterways from bushfire prone areas, were blamed., Since 16 January, the NSW government has received reports of fish kills at 13 locations in the Murray-Darling catchment., An update to the NSW Department of Primary Industries “fish kills” website shows the Macquarie River, Gwydir River, Buckinbah Creek and the Turon River have all seen reports of localised events that have killed hundreds to thousands of fish., In the Turon River, thousands of fish including Murray cod, golden perch and carp had died. Rain had caused “short and sharp” flows into the river, along with run-off, and had reduced oxygen levels.Two sites in the Macquarie River had been affected. A 32km stretch of the river near Dubbo had been seen the deaths of thousands of fish, including Murray cod, golden perch, freshwater catfish, carp and shrimp. That event was ongoing, the department said., Murray cod, golden perch, silver perch, bony bream, common carp and shrimp had also been reported dead around Raby, south of Sydney, when river flow had hit a previously dry river bed, mobilising “thick plumes of silt and picking up significant volumes of organic debris.”, Two sites in the Murray River had also seen reports of deaths., Earlier this month, hundreds of thousands of fish died in the Macleay River near Kempsey, in a mass fish kill event that ecologists said could have impacts for decades., A NSW Department of Primary Industries spokesperson told Guardian Australia the state was likely to see further fish kills “across coastal and inland catchments during the summer of 2020.”, The spokesperson said: “Extended hot days with a cool change have been forecast for the coming days across much of NSW, which unfortunately poses a significant risk to our native fish populations in certain areas., “Additionally, runoff from bushfire and drought affected areas can impact water quality and place stress on river health and on native fish.”, Drought, run-off from bushfire-hit areas were putting increased stress on fish populations, the spokesperson said., The fisheries department had been working with local communities to relocate more than 3,000 fish and 43 aeration units had been installed., On Thursday, the Murray–Darling Basin Authority issued an update saying rain in the past fortnight had been a catalyst for the deaths., The MDBA executive director of river operations, Andrew Reynolds, said it was “a cruel twist but an unavoidable risk that much-needed rain would contribute to fish deaths in areas affected by ash and sediment being washed into waterways.”, He said: “We have seen fish deaths in recent weeks in several locations under stress due to fires and the ongoing drought – in the Macquarie River, the Namoi, Gwydir, Border rivers, Barwon–Darling, Lachlan, Upper Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers, and the Lower Darling continues to be an area of concern.”, Basin governments were “working hard” to relocate fish, install aerators and deliver strategic releases of water for the environment, he said., He added: “The rain has so far had little impact on overall basin storage levels, which are at 27% capacity overall. Though some catchments will see levels recover slightly over coming weeks, the total volume of water in basin storages continued to decline over the past fortnight., “We really need a long period of above-average rainfall to break current drought conditions.”, There were 13 sites covered by blue-green algae alerts in NSW and three more at locations in Victoria, the authority said.murray darling thousands of fish have died in nsw in past two weeks", "label": 0}, "train-94": {"text": "\nAustralian firefighters battle multiple blazes - video\n, Australia has experienced another difficult day as several fires burn near Canberra and in New South Wales.

The fires were moving through paddocks but conditions were noticeably better. , The winds had dropped. The temperature was down. The flames weren’t moving with same intensity and unpredictability as earlier , Hopefully this helps firefighters get on top of the Clear Range bushfire, still at emergency level, which has burned through vast swathes since it began as a spot fire from the Orroral Valley fire in Namadgi. , BC Radio has reported homes have been lost in the region around the towns of Bredbo and Michelago, though we still don’t know how many.

It is not unusual for it to be this warm, but it is unusual for it to be this humid - and for the hot air to be trapped for this long., The weather bureau tell us that is because warm, moist air has traveled down from the Northern Territory and Queensland. It’s become trapped by the storms in Victoria, which has pushed the air across the ACT and NSW - making it pretty challenging for firefighters., There is not expected to be any notable cool down until around 11pm, when a southerly pushes through. But even then, it won’t be enough, with the hot air expected to stick around until Monday., There is a cool change coming.

They’re nervous. Everyone in this region is., Fires around Australia’s capital have been raging for days, enveloping the city in smoke and threatening towns and suburbs on its outer edges., But Laurence Cowie is calm. He’s been watching the fire since it broached the hilltops at 6.30am. The house is prepared. There’s little fuel around and a clear break between the home and the old, dried-out gums and pines that line parts of the property., “I’ve got the beer on ice,” Laurence jokes to the Guardian. “Power’s always the first thing to go. Warm beer: it’s deadly.”, Each time a spot fire threatens the fringes of his property, Laurence floors his ute to the scene, dousing the flames before they can take hold., As the vehicle zips to and fro across Tallabrook Lodge, the sky overhead is darkening. The wind begins to whip through the valley, gusting with all-consuming force., The Cowies are at the edge of the property, protecting their stables, when the chaos arrives. From nowhere a wind picks up and sends fire barrelling towards the back of their home. Laurence is too far away to do anything., Screams for help are muffled by the wind. Each new yell draws thick smoke into the lungs., Inside, the wind rattles the windows. Flames are licking at the back wall. Each glass pane becomes a portal to the hell outside., Everywhere is chaos. The horses break free and run wildly from the flames., New fires are breaking out on all sides.

Its fury only abates when it has no more grass to feed on., It finally burns itself out and an eerie calm descends on the valley., All that’s left is blackened earth. The hills to the west are burnt and smouldering. Thick smoke still lingers., The paddocks on every side are scorched right up to the house. Dried-out gum trees are slowly consumed by remnants of fire. Old tree trunks are burning., Not far from the home, flames slowly eat away at the stable, until it’s little more than a heap of crumpled iron., With it goes the 120 hay bales Laurence was using to feed his mares and two dozen head of cattle., “I’ve been stockpiling to save starving animals,” he says. “Now I’ve got starving animals and no feed.”, The house is encircled by evidence of disaster but, miraculously, it has survived., “Well, what can you do, we’re alive,” Claire says. “We’ve got a house.

For fear that the group might link this menace with the forbidden term “climate change”, the leader Australians now call “Scotty from marketing” refused to meet them, though in good faith they kept on trying to arrange a session with him into the spring. As they pointed out, Morrison took considerably less time before meeting church leaders who wanted to be exempt from anti-discrimination laws involving the employment of gay staff and similar “freedom of religion” matters. The fire chiefs worried that we share our combustibility with the Pacific coast of the United States, and that given the overlapping North American and Australian fire seasons, the hiring of air tankers was going to get more and more difficult. Above all, they were concerned that this summer’s fires would take on a new scale and not surrender to normal firefighting. They felt they had begun to see abnormal symptoms in the 1990s., Once we got over our colonial Eurocentrism and realised that the Australian bush was not going to go to any trouble to imitate European flora, we began to take a perverse pride in the fact that so many of our plants are germinated by fire: “phoenix plants”. We know now that our species has been in Australia so long, for tens of millennia, that Indigenous Australians learned fire-stick farming – regenerating the continent with skilfully lit fires, which also had the benefit of flushing protein-rich marsupials out into the open. The reality is that swathes of Australia must burn for its own good. Les Murray, the late, great poet, said Australia had only two seasons: drought, of which fires were symptomatic, and flood., Both sides of the country, east and west, have had calamitous drought and fires in their time. But the drying out to which Australia has been subjected in this last year is unprecedented and seems to most people to proclaim climate crisis. The denialists are making a last stand by accusing the Greens of preventing back-burning in national parks; and of course the Murdoch press embraces that proposition and emphasises cases of arson. The fact that there are cases of arson, and always have been in Australia and California, explains a minority of blazes, but it does not explain the voracity and appetite of these flames. On the right wing of the coalition that governs Australia, and which Morrison needs if he is to govern, sturdy climate denial remains undented. Yet the climate crisis has for the first time replaced the economy as the nation’s chief political issue, for the very question of the habitability of Australia now stares us in the face. On 4 January, an outer suburb of Sydney – Penrith, below the Blue Mountains that were burning at the time – achieved the highest temperature on Earth that day, 48.9C. Sydney suburbs, as hot as they can be in summer, have never achieved such Saharan heights before., What have I noticed, living as I do between the harbour and the Pacific Ocean on the North Head of Sydney? Day after day, beginning as early as August, smoke has rendered going abroad in the city an unknown risk about which experts warn us but cannot accurately predict. Air quality has on some days been 11 times the hazardous level. , Today, a Thursday in late January, is better than many days, in that the air quality is merely poor and visibility good, though not as good as it traditionally is on cut-crystal summer days on the coast. We have frequently been sunk in smoky dimness. The water in the smoke condenses on particles and creates a kind of cloud we have seen a lot of, the pyrocumulonimbus, which blankets the earth but does not bring rain, although it is capable of creating dry lightning. For most of my life, heat waves – and today is nudging 40 and qualifies – used always to bring, after a time, a southerly change in the late afternoon or evening. There were always strong winds and a drenching thunderstorm. In the last few years, we have had to get used to the southerly buster that brings no rain, the dry southerly that whips up fire. There is no rain forecast for today or at the end of this hot spate, though there is a prediction for next week., The New South Wales coast is a place of childhood vacations and dreams, with beaches that stretch for miles, I am lucky enough to live next to a national park, and when I first moved here there was a hanging swamp on top of the vast sandstone block of North Head. This was a swamp that in most seasons had water in it, though it would occasionally dry out for short periods. It was the home of a number of species of frog. It was visited by ducks and other water birds, and by a handsome lizard called the water dragon, which enjoyed eating the tiger moths that lived there. That swamp has been dry for two years. Drying out has happened all along the coast, and we have had the extraordinary spectacle of fires burning down to the fringe of beaches, and populations taken off the coast by warship., The New South Wales coast is a place of childhood vacations and dreams, with atmospheric paperbark swamps running behind beaches that stretch for miles. The lagoons and swamps were perpetually too moist to burn. Fires burning down to the coast is, to use the catchphrase, the new normal. The coast and its valleys and beaches have been places where great numbers of nature lovers, retirees and escapees from the city have chosen to settle. The coast north and south of Sydney is a dream every city dweller has entertained, a migration always on the cards for us. Now an exceptional vulnerability has overtaken regions where people previously lived securely in the bush. The Keneallys’ chosen town on immigration – Kempsey, New South Wales – has for the first time since settlement been ringed by fire. Its long, exquisite river, the Macleay, has become tainted with so much ash that fish have died. Even rainforest has become combustible., Recently, on a walk in the bush, I encountered one of the species threatened, by the fires and the state of the world, with extinction. It is one of the two survivors from the ancient supercontinent of Gondwanaland: the echidna, a spiny anteater that both lays an egg and suckles its young in the comfort of its burrow. I love this creature: it gives off an air, despite its limited movement, of industry, and she was turning over the earth to the depth of her beak in her search for provender. It was touching to see this most enduring of animals at its ancient earthwork, unchallenged by fire here, unlike in other forests. It speaks to how much human occupation, a tower of millennia, there has been in Australia, and of the contrast between its Indigenous stewards and the stewardship of us immigrant groups. It had taken us less than two and a half centuries to bring the 50m-year-surviving echidna, and the system sustaining it, to crisis., In this crisis, the volunteer bush firefighter was once an unassertive creature like the echidna. Now, in an age of bitter politics and economic palaver, they have asserted themselves as miracles of social cohesion and human goodwill. The volunteers often come from areas in which they are fighting the fires, and in many cases have helped save houses without knowing if their own home was still standing. They were also, of necessity, the first comforters of those who had survived the loss of their houses. They have lost wages and tested the patience of their employers by needing to take tranches of time off work. One of the retired fire chiefs who tried to speak to “Sco-Mo” last year was Greg Mullins, a volunteer who recently said, “Like countless other men and women on the front line, I have faced off against 30m walls of flame, seen many homes burned to the ground, tried to console inconsolable residents, been forced to run for safety and seen native animals bounding out of the burning bush to collapse and die.” He is angered as politicians describe climate change as “perhaps one of the factors”., These fires have not been a straw in the wind. They have been brutally manifest and undeniable in the force of their argument. They have the power to change politics here and in other places, as long as they are read honestly. After our long glorying in minerals, it is promised that, if it wishes, Australia can be a leader in the new post-fossil-fuel world. It is a destiny our politicians seem unwilling to embrace, but they may have to., For the fires have changed us. Perhaps we, too, need fire to germinate an essential concept., • Thomas Keneally is the author of more than 30 novels, including Schindler’s Ark, which won the Booker prize in 1982, This article has details on how to help with the Australian relief effort., If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).thomas keneally these fires have changed us", "label": 0}, "train-99": {"text": "‘We’ve pissed mother nature off, big time’: the people coming home after Australia's fires, \n‘We’ve pissed mother nature off, big time’: the people coming home after Australia's fires\n, While the fires rage on, residents of neighbouring towns in New South Wales look to the future, by  Gideon Mendel, \n\nSat 1 Feb 2020 01.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 07.24 EST\n\n, Gino McDonald, 61, builder (on left), and Patto McDonald, 56, artist, Upper Brogo, Patto We were keeping an eye on the Fires Near Me app. By about lunchtime on New Year’s Eve we’d packed our daughter and grandkids up and sent them off. We stopped by the fire shed on the top of the hill. They seemed to think we were going to be all right, so we thought we’d be back the next day. We grabbed some dirty clothes baskets, a few things. But when we looked at Fires Near Me the next morning, we were horrified at how big it had got overnight. They reckon the fire spread at 60km an hour., It was a shock for days. It wasn’t until the third time we came back that I took everything in: the neighbours’ houses all gone, just a wasteland. It was as if we’d never been here before., We’ve lived here around 17 years. I had a lot of things – my grandmother’s and my mum’s. It’s taken me two weeks of saying, “Oh, it’s just stuff”, until my daughter said, “Stop saying that, Mum, it’s not just stuff.” But it was; that’s been a lesson for me, not to get attached to things, because it doesn’t matter., We don’t have any insurance, so we’ll be starting from scratch again. We started off here in a tent, anyway, so I guess we’ll be going back to one. It’s like Seasick Steve sang: “I started out with nothing, and I’ve still got most of it left.”, We lived simply. We had one solar panel that was enough to give us lights, and a gas fridge; we used a lot of recycled materials. So that makes it a bit easier to start over. Our chief concern is our daughter, who moved in with us before Christmas with two babies; we’ll probably rush to get something up for her., Jenni Bruce, 63, artist, Upper Brogo, New South Wales, I’ve lived here for 44 years. It’s fringe farming country and we’ve got all kinds of people: tradies, chippies, sparkies; life-changers as well, retirees and artists who have come to live in the bush., It was New Year’s Eve when we knew we’d have to evacuate, but we thought we had a great deal more time – that it wasn’t going to reach us until the next day. I was planning to stay in that night, but some of my friends had already evacuated to Quaama, a nearby village – I thought I’d just pop in and see them. When I turned around to come home, I saw the fire front. It was just a land-eating monster, tearing through with a ferocity like nothing I’d ever seen. I knew there was no going back into that., We waited in Quaama and watched until it became very evident that we needed to move. I helped a couple of locals evacuate, so I was probably one of the last cars out. By the time I was on the highway, the fire was only a few metres away; it was just so hot and so loud – the noise was unbelievable., At 5am we arrived in the tiny beach town of Bermagui and spent the day there. It was chaotic, a thousand people poured into a small space with only four toilets. None of us had much in the way of supplies, but the shops, bowling club, pub – everybody was doing their best to make people comfortable., Coming back home for the first time, after a few nights, was awful. You always hold out that tiny bit of hope that, just maybe, there’s something. But it was all gone. I had a great workshop with tools that I had spent a lifetime gathering. There was a beautiful garden, with lots of blueberry plants and fruit trees. I’d recently sold a lot of things to fix the place up, so I could stay as I grew older, and I’d just finished renovating. I had a huge collection of paints and canvases, and I was working on a new body of work to exhibit. It was just devastating to lose that amount of hard work. All I could do was keen – it’s a really weird noise; I’d only made it once before in my life, but I keened., There’s not a single person in the entire region who is not traumatised – all over the Great Dividing Range. I wish the people in power would listen; I wish they would stop using industries that are so bad for our environment. I hope that the underlying anger, because of mismanagement from our leaders, does not overrule the kindness and compassion that people are showing in the present moment. I don’t really know what my life lesson is: I’m just very glad to be alive., Sharyn Wotton, 61, teacher’s aide, and Tom Wotton (AKA Swampy Tom), 66, retiree, Wandella, Sharyn Tom and I have been together 45 years and lived at Wandella for 24. We have 100 acres about 15km from the nearest town. It’s not a hobby farm – we don’t raise animals. We just live here for the peace and quiet, the serenity., We had always agreed we wouldn’t stay and fight a fire. We had used planks of foam, pontoons from Sydney harbour, as insulation for our walls. But the 75 acres we had behind us were wooded, and we’re in a gully, so we thought: we don’t have enough water. On 30 December, our eldest daughter, Carly, texted and said: “Mum, it’s doubled again.” Our two sons-in-law hooked up our 1979 Millard deluxe caravan, and we put a few bits and pieces in there and the car. I remember my daughter Teagan saying, “Mum do you want this, this?”, and I said, “No, I’ll come back tomorrow.” But there wasn’t a tomorrow., After a few days, we went to Canberra, where we got word from our neighbour who had stayed to defend his property. He said a huge firewall just came from nowhere, up one side of their house, and he knew then our place was probably gone. He was alive, and his kids were alive, but there have been so many horror stories. We’ve got friends who ran through firewalls to save themselves and ended up with burns. One family lost a father and son. We might have lost property, but there are people out there who are traumatised for ever. For me, it comes in waves. If I’m not talking about it, I’m OK., When we drove back, I was stunned. I joke that I’m a collector, not a hoarder, but I had a lot of stuff – big bookcases and stuff hanging from ceilings, and it’s all gone. We didn’t have insurance at the time of the bushfire. One of our children, without asking, started a GoFundMe page. When he found out, Tom was really angry and said, “We’re not a charity case.” Carly sat him down and said, “For 24 years, you have watered and fed people. People have come for two days and stayed for five because you make them feel welcome.” She said, “They’re donating to you. They want you to rebuild.”, We’ve pissed mother nature off big time, and she’s paying us back. We’ve just been watching it get drier and drier – the whole valley’s been a tinderbox. Nobody heeded the warnings. Surely they’ll listen now. , Fina Montagner, 49, care nurse, and Anthony Montagner, 64, former electrician, with their sons Christian, 10, and Dylan, six, Upper Brogo, Anthony We had gone into Bega to do some shopping on New Year’s Eve, and Fina and the boys decided to stay because everyone was talking about the fire. At about 5.30 that afternoon I came back here with the dogs to get the farm ready, thinking I could stay and fight the fire., At eight o’clock, there was no sign of fire. At 10 o’clock I went out to turn the generator off and noticed the glow to the west, 10, 15km out at least. I’ve had fires here in the past and I thought, well, that won’t be here till the morning., Forty-five minutes later, and the fire’s in my next gully. So I barely had 15 minutes to grab the dogs, a couple of cans of fuel, the kids’ bikes, a pair of jeans and I took off. I was only ever 10 minutes from the fire all the way to the coast. , I’ve had fires get away on me in the early years. This was a monster; it was racing as fast as my van would go. And the noise sounded like a couple of freight trains. It was sucking air in from all directions. It was a fire-breathing dragon, spitting hot flames everywhere. But it’s not climate change – I’ve heard of at least 180 people arrested for arson.,  I haven’t been insured for 25 years. I’ve built what I had by scrounging. When I met Fina, she got a job so we were able to buy some new materials, but other than that everything in the house was built from bush wood. It was all repurposed junk. But I’m not going to do that again, there’s nothing left here to do it with. I’m not prepared to start scrounging again., We’ve got a caravan for the boys. We’ve got another coming for us. So we’re just going to camp here for the time being, maybe six months, a year. , Fina The little one seems OK, because he’s only six. But Christian is having issues. He gets very angry and then he’s anxious. He’s been really sad in the last few weeks., Anthony I don’t have one photo to show them what their grandmother looked like. I’m hoping my siblings might have some. I don’t have photos of my childhood or anything I’ve done as a teenager. It’s like I’ve never existed. , Fina We’re just hoping to be strong, emotionally, for the boys. They have got no one but us, so we need to show them that we are tough., Ron Corby Snr, 87, farmer; his son, Ron Jr, 67, farmer, and his wife Gloria, 71, housewife; granddaughter Tammie, 42, carer, with Brett Jee, 45, painter, and their sons (from left) Blake, 16, Myles, 12, Beau, 10, Mason, 14, in Wandella, Ronald At 2.30am, I received an urgent call: “If you want to get out, get out now!” I looked out the window – everything looked normal and I went back to bed. Ten minutes later, my daughter pulled up and said, “Pop, get in the car and go! My house just burned down and the fire followed me, nearly as fast as I could drive.” When I came back a couple of days later, there was just charcoal., This fire was hotter than anything. I saw cars’ aluminium wheels melted and running down the gutter like a stream. The fire came from all angles, in whirling winds and twisters. It’s 35 years since the bush was last burnt out. The stuff in the mountains has been building up; you couldn’t walk through it, there’s that much rubbish. When the fire came, the whole mountain seemed to explode. I don’t think it was the climate crisis that caused this; I think it was neglect, not keeping the mountains clean. , I grew up in the Great Depression. Back then, it was a bit like this. We had nothing. But when someone was sick, the community would come together. I thought, in this modern age, that was gone – it looked like people would rather cut your throat. But I was wrong. A man who didn’t know me gave me A$500, and he’d probably lost his job the same as anyone. But the human love is there and stronger than ever. , Ron All my life I’ve fought bushfires, but there’s never been one like this: the fireballs, the way it roared, the flames, 50-60ft high. Sometimes it seemed to be above the ground, just burning the air. It sucked the roof off the house and threw our cars a kilometre away. , Tammie Forensics think two fire fronts collided and created their own storm. My brother had a bull that was killed in the fire and is still sitting upright. It was just instantly cooked, mummified. They told us that for that to happen, it had to reach 2,000 degrees. I don’t think it’s climate change; the bush here hasn’t been burned back in 15, 20 years., We have five boys. Mason has muscular dystrophy and we’d set up an aviary for him. He can’t do anything active, but loves birds and wanted to breed them. They were all lost. He was hard hit and cried quite a bit, but we’ve told him we’ll build him a new one. , We didn’t bring the boys straight out here. But our youngest, who’s 10, would not stop asking what it was like. Is this still OK? Is that still OK? So we thought we should show them that there is nothing salvageable. But he found a few garden ornaments and said, “Look, Mum, you can put this in the new garden.”, Brett and I have been together 24 years. So when the insurance company says, “Can you write down a few lists of your assets?” there aren’t enough notebooks. I’ve not seen my husband cry like this. Brett’s father passed away a few years ago and he had a lot of his belongings here, tools and stuff you’ll never get again. But we’re just thankful that none of us are lost. All our family’s still here., Veronica Coen, 59, mental health clinician, and Murray Gibbs, 62, trike tour guide, Quaama, Veronica We were away, visiting my daughter and her family. But this just wasn’t a fire that human beings could tame. It’s become very political. I call myself a fire refugee, and think about the people in the Pacific Ocean on the low-lying islands, and war refugees – because it’s as if there has been a war. , For a while I had a great deal of hope that the people who run the country would have to get it. That’s dissipating now. There has to be some kind of transformation in the way we govern. This two-party system is combative: they consume too much energy on the ego stuff and don’t respond to human need., A lot of people I’ve spoken to are clearly dealing with post-traumatic stress. I had a meltdown the other day and made someone else really sad. I was able to collect myself the next day and was welcomed back with open arms, because everybody’s falling apart. I’m a trauma-informed practitioner, and it’s a slow process. I’m not someone who usually posts my status on Facebook, but before I knew it, I just put it up there: “Don’t rush my recovery.” That’s really what it feels like. , In my work, we talk about collective trauma. Until now, I’ve only read papers and heard it spoken about in relation to Indigenous communities, for example. We talk about intergenerational trauma and collective trauma – this is what we have. , Pam Sweeny, 63, nurse, Cobargo, My husband, Michael, and I had four children, and brought them up here in a way that’s kind to the environment. We’ve been using stand-alone solar power for 31 years. We’ve got our own water, and got rid of our own effluent in a way that’s friendly to mother nature. We had our family of native birds, too. We’d lie on the grass with the kids at night and watch the little gliders glide out., When we came back, the trees were still falling. It felt sad and unsafe. There was a big tree across the driveway, and piles of tin from the sheds that had been burned out. I wake up with tears, but then you just get busy. What we’ve done to Australia in the years that we’ve been here, us whitefellas, we’ve got to learn – we’ve done too much damage and mother nature’s hitting back., We didn’t even have a lock on the door, so we couldn’t get insurance. That is not unusual here. There’s loss, but we can replace it. New year, new beginning. We’ll be fine, but people who were used to spending five minutes in the shower and leaving their lights on will struggle. We’ve got to stop being such consumers, and think about where things come from: from mother nature., David Wilson, 59 (on right), and Kyle Moser, 41, both post office workers, Cobargo, David I’m the licensee of Cobargo post office. Kyle and I moved here four years ago from the city, and we love the place. It’s the most unique community: 50% old-style farmers, 50% new people, often very musical or artistic. One in three says they’ve lost their house. We’re still hearing of people in hospital. Each one that dies is just a blackness, a real sadness., We didn’t really sleep on New Year’s Eve; we just watched and waited. It got to a point where it was coming in all directions. There’s only one road out, and it looked like the single bridge that leads into town was on fire, too. We headed for the ocean with four dogs, two cats and two rescued wallabies in the car. , The community response has been amazing: we had a relief centre, operational pretty much from that night, and it just grew. There were toilets, showers; they quickly got a generator on site., When Kyle and I came here, we were widely accepted as a gay couple. Quite a few families, although they might seem tough on the exterior, have a gay son or a gay nephew. During the marriage equality debate, we raised the rainbow flag, and Australia Post told us to take it down – they wanted to remain impartial. The response of the community was: “Well, if the boys can’t fly their flags, we’ll do it for them.” Shops put rainbow-coloured clothes over the balconies, the bookshop put rainbow-coloured books in the windows. It was amazing., We’re lucky that we’re insured, but precious things were lost. For my 50th birthday, we had a ring made with diamonds and my date of birth on – that’s gone. , But what upsets me most is the political inaction of the last two years, when they’ve been warned of these conditions. People had been asked for additional firefighting aircraft. They should be held criminally responsible. , Seraphina Leahy, 20, artist and barista, Wandella , I moved out here to get away from everyday life, and to try not to have an impact on the environment. When we heard there were fires coming, we packed up a few things and went to my mum’s house in Bermagui. Then the Rural Fire Service said we needed to evacuate. We went down to the beach, and when you looked back, you couldn’t see the mountain any more: it was pitch dark and a huge glow reflected on the ocean. We camped on the beach, and went fishing to calm our nerves, so we kept ourselves fed. We had my nana with us, who’s in her 80s., We had word that the house was gone, but until we saw it I didn’t really believe it. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, mentally and physically., The support’s been amazing; if we didn’t have that we probably wouldn’t be doing OK. You’ve got social media, and sometimes it feels as if everyone’s always arguing, but when something like this happens, humans pull together and look after each other., We were doing our best not to make an impact, having a carbon offset with all our trees. In two years it’s gone from lush green pastures and forest, to the leaves on the trees just dropping. The flowers don’t come out, the animals are struggling, everything is yellow and brown. , I think the prime minister needs to have more empathy. The government cut so much funding to forestry and national parks. Everyone’s dry in terms of resources; we need the land managed properly. , • Additional research by Annette Widitz., The Cobargo Community Bushfire Recovery Fund is crowdfunding for the local area.

In October Guardian Australia revealed the Australian Bureau of Statistics had dumped the questions from the test after intervention from the assistant treasurer’s office, prompting backlash from stakeholders including the LGBTI Health Alliance., In December, Foley wrote to Sukkar lobbying him to include the questions. In a letter, seen by Guardian Australia, Hunt replied by saying the federal government is “committed to supporting the mental health and wellbeing of LGBTI+ people”., “To that end I have written to the assistant treasurer to signal my support for the inclusion of questions that would greatly inform the government’s knowledge about the LGBTI+ population cohort in Australia in the 2021 census.”, He acknowledged that “LGBTI+ Australians often have unique healthcare needs and are at an increased risk of poor health outcomes and mental health issues”., “From a health systems perspective, access to a more complete and nationally inclusive data collection would assist the Australian government to inform the development of policies that ensure access to appropriate health services for all Australians,” Hunt said., Foley, who is also the minister for mental health, has written to concerned stakeholders noting that Hunt’s reply “suggests these issues are still under consideration” at the federal level., Foley said he was disturbed to see “the increasingly deliberate politicisation of LGBTIQ issues in the public arena”, arguing this contributes to mental health issues for LGBTIQ people., “We remain committed to opposing moves to wind back hard-fought discrimination protections for our LGBTIQ communities.”, Foley told Guardian Australia it is “disappointing – but sadly unsurprising – to see the federal government is once again divided over such an important issue, letting party politics get in the way of improving the lives of LGBTIQ Australians”., “Not counting LGBTIQ Australians in the 2021 census would send a message that the commonwealth believes these people should remain invisible,” he said., “We know LGBTIQ people are over-represented in poorer economic, housing, health and mental health outcomes – comprehensive demographic data would be one of the best tools we have to improve these measures, so all levels of government can tailor health and social services to better suit their needs.”, “If the commonwealth really care about suicide prevention and mental health they must take this important step in helping to reduce stigma and discrimination for LGBTIQ Australians.”, Stephen Jones, Labor’s shadow assistant treasurer, said it is clear Sukkar’s position is “driven by ideology” and Scott Morrison should intervene to ensure the questions are included. , “To do otherwise would be to deny agencies important information needed for health planning purposes,” he said. “The census can’t be a political football.”, The ABS has recommended the government not put a new question on sexual orientation into the 2021 census, despite acknowledging that two federal departments including the health department need the data to deliver services and it would have “strong value across all levels of government”., Documents produced to the Senate reveal that despite extensive consultation with LGBTI health groups about questions on sexual orientation and gender identity and an “identified need” for sexuality data, the ABS believed the potential new topics were too sensitive and risked public backlash., In December LGBTI Health Alliance executive director, Nicky Bath, said the ABS recommendation was “disappointing” because of the “great need” for gender and sexuality data which should be put above “the politics and individual viewpoints”., The decision about new questions for the 2021 census will be made at cabinet level, with a decision expected to be tabled in parliament in 2020., Since becoming prime minister in August 2018, Scott Morrison has been criticised by LGBTI equality advocates for politicising sexuality and gender identity., Morrison has opposed sex education programs he agreed made his “skin curl” by teaching the fact of diversity in human sexuality, described teachers who support trans students as “gender whisperers” and demanded his department remove signage that gives people the choice of bathroom based on their gender identity., Sukkar and Morrison both opposed same-sex marriage during the postal survey campaign, then abstained when the bill passed parliament. Sukkar also charged taxpayers almost $1,500 to attend a campaign rally against same-sex marriage.health minister greg hunt lobbied for gender and sexuality questions in census", "label": 0}, "train-101": {"text": "Morning mail: Coronavirus evacuation, London 'terror' stabbing, Djokovic triumphs, \nMorning mail: Coronavirus evacuation, London 'terror' stabbing, Djokovic triumphs\n, Monday: Australians stranded in Wuhan due to begin journey to Christmas Island.

It is understood the flight was due to depart from Wuhan at 2am local time (5am AEDT) and would head straight to mainland Australia, where those on board will then be transported to Christmas Island for a 14-day quarantine period. Footage of government officials in Wuhan appearing to take face masks intended for health workers battling the highly infectious coronavirus has fuelled a growing wave of anger over how Chinese authorities have handled the outbreak. It comes as the Philippines has reported the first death from the coronavirus outside China, adding to fears about the spread of the virus as more countries imposed travel restrictions. China’s central bank has pledged to pump 1.2tn yuan (A$256bn) into its financial system in an attempt to protect its economy from the coronavirus epidemic., Bridget McKenzie has resigned from Scott Morrison’s ministry in an effort to stem the rolling controversy and political damage over sports grants before the opening of the 2020 parliamentary session this week. The prime minister confirmed the departure of the besieged deputy leader of the Nationals late on Sunday after receiving advice from his departmental head and former chief of staff, Phil Gaetjens, and after a meeting with the governance committee of cabinet. Morrison declined to release the Gaetjens adjudication. “Morrison wants this whole mess to be over with McKenzie’s departure,” writes Katherine Murphy. “Quick prediction.

The Metropolitan police confirmed the man, who was shot at about 2pm in Streatham, had been pronounced dead and added: “We believe there are two injured victims. We await updates on their conditions.” They said the scene had been “fully contained”. The man shot dead by police was wearing a “fake suicide vest” made of objects designed to look like an improvised explosive device., A group of 200 scientists are urging parliament to reduce Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and work diplomatically to achieve coordinated global climate action after a catastrophic summer of bushfires., Government should abandon plans to increase employer contributions towards superannuation because new research shows about 80% of the extra money would be taken out of pay packets in the form of lower wage increases, the Grattan Institute says., The father of three of four children killed after a car crashed into them in Sydney has spoken of his devastating loss.

The former president of the European council told the BBC he had great sympathy with the desire of many Scots to rejoin the EU after Brexit., In 2019 the idea of a millennial and Gen Z “sex recession” became fact. “Or it became the 2019 version of a fact: something we all (myself included) absorb after reading viral headlines on Facebook,” writes Meg Watson. “Last year ABC’s national survey Australia Talks found that 40% of people aged 18 to 24 report ‘never’ having sex.

The letter says the science suggests a need for immediate action to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions, and manage a rapid transition to net zero emissions by 2050., One of the signatories to the open letter, the Australian National University climate scientist Nerilie Abram, says the letter is “the product of despair as scientists witnessed the deadly fire season unfold”., “Scientists have been warning policymakers for decades that climate change would worsen Australia’s fire risk, and yet those warnings have been ignored,” she said., Given the catastrophic summer, with the bushfires triggering a barrage of commentary about the inadequacy of the Morrison government’s current policy, a number of Liberal MPs are returning to Canberra for the opening session parliament with the view that the government needs to do more on climate change and energy policy. Cabinet has also discussed the issue., The strongly worded appeal by scientists comes as a new energy market analysis by Reputex predicts Australia will hit 50% renewable electricity by 2030, despite the lack of a federal energy policy. But it also warns a slump in new investment in wind and solar investment could threaten a continued decline in wholesale electricity prices., Reputex says the current drive to 50% renewables by 2030 is being driven by state renewable energy targets and rooftop solar schemes that are predicted to make higher cost gas and coal-fired power less competitive. It says that transition is expected to deliver a decline in wholesale prices in the national energy market from around $80 per megawatt-hour (/MWh) in 2020 toward $70/MWh over the next three years, which translates as a fall of 15% from today’s levels., But it warns investment in renewable energy plunged by 50% last year compared with the year before, and it predicts that decline will continue – a development that will put upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices, particularly as major coal-fired facilities begin to close., “In the absence of an effective policy framework to guide new investment, the decline of our ageing generation fleet will lead to higher electricity prices before the new supply is developed, hurting both businesses and consumers,” the assessment says., In an effort to emphasise a positive message on the issue, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told the ABC on Sunday the Morrison government’s 2030 emissions reduction target of 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 was a floor and not a cap, “and we hope to beat our target”., But while declaring the government wanted to beat the 2030 target, Frydenberg said the target wasn’t going to be adjusted., “We took to the Australian people a very clear target, so we’re not about to lift that target,” the treasurer said. “What we are endeavouring to do is to meet our commitments now.”, Frydenberg did not mention that the government intends to use an accounting measure, carryover credits from the Kyoto period, to meet the 2030 target, with carryover credits, not practical abatement, supplying about half the pollution reduction load to 2030., The treasurer also played up the government’s commitment to renewable energy. Frydenberg said on Sunday that more than $7bn was invested in renewables last year. He omitted the Coalition’s efforts under Tony Abbott to gut the renewable energy target (RET), and the fact the RET winds down from this year – with policy uncertainty triggering the decline in new investment captured in the Reputex analysis., Asked whether he believed there was now a climate emergency, the treasurer hedged. “Climate change is a significant challenge, a global challenge that needs a global solution,” he said., “We’re doing our bit and we’re also working on the international stage.”, Pressed to explain how climate change was not an emergency, Frydenberg said “it’s an important issue, but as the prime minister has outlined, there are a lot of things that we can do with mitigation and adaptation to try to reduce the impact of climate change on the Australian community”.scientists call on mps to urgently reduce australias emissions amid bushfire crisis", "label": 0}, "train-104": {"text": "80% of superannuation increase would come from pay packets, Grattan report says, Thinktank’s report draws fire from proponents of an increased employer contribution, who point to conflicting research, The government should abandon plans to increase the amount employers have to contribute towards superannuation because new research shows about 80% of the extra money would be taken out of pay packets in the form of lower wage increases, the Grattan Institute says., In a new report released on Monday, the centrist thinktank used data from enterprise bargaining agreements to attempt to track the effect of increases in the super rate on wages., It is both Coalition and Labor policy to increase the contribution rate from 9.5% to 12%, but the Morrison government is conducting a review of the retirement income system that may give it political cover to abandon the idea., “This trade-off between more superannuation in retirement but lower living standards while working isn’t worth it for most Australians,” said Grattan household finances program director, Brendan Coates, who was lead author of the report., The new Grattan report, which doubles as a submission to the government review, drew fire from proponents of increasing the rate even before it was released, with the powerful industry super lobby, which stands to benefit from extra contributions if the rate increases, dismissing it out of hand., Industry Super Australia chief executive, Bernie Dean, said Grattan’s view was “nothing new”., “Grattan came to this flawed conclusion last year, and have now come back with cherry-picked information to support a preconceived fantasy view of the world that ignores women, the self-employed and periods outside of the workforce,” he said., ISA pointed to work done for it by economist Jim Stanford last year that found no correlation between higher super rates and lower wages growth., However, in their report Coates and his team said Stanford’s model could only capture the short-run effects of an increase in super on wages and claimed that small changes in his assumptions produced large changes in outcomes., Stanford, the director of the Centre for Future Work at leftwing thinktank the Australia Institute, said he had not reviewed the Grattan report but could comment generally., “It is easy for modellers to find fine criticisms of others’ modelling,” he said. “I can provide a more thorough discussion of these issues (especially when I am able to fully review their work), but I think most peoples’ eyes will gloss over.”, He said the new report represented a backdown by Grattan because it had previously “previously assumed a full 1:1 trade-off between wages and superannuation guarantee contributions”., “Even Grattan’s findings confirm that wages do not fully decline to offset increases in the superannuation guarantee rate,” he said., “This research thus confirms that total labour compensation does indeed grow when the superannuation guarantee rate is increased (contrary to the previously assumed 1:1 trade-off).”, Grattan has previously argued that the rate should not be increased because the current 9% level provides for a good retirement for most Australians., This research has been fiercely criticised by industry super for neglecting the fact that many women take time out of the workforce to raise children, but in its new report Grattan says its work shows that retirement incomes remain adequate even if people take a break from the workforce of up to 10 years., Coates said the Grattan’s latest research added to the case against an increase., “Together, these findings demand a rethink of Australia’s retirement incomes system,” he said., Grattan’s salvo follows a call from the chairman of Industry Super Australia, Greg Combet, for the rate to be raised straight away., Writing for Guardian Australia on Saturday, Combet said that “workers need more than the 9.5% of their earnings they receive as super contributions (on top of their wages) to reach an adequate, dignified retirement”.80 of superannuation increase would come from pay packets grattan report says", "label": 0}, "train-105": {"text": "\nScott Morrison wants the sports rorts mess to be over with McKenzie's exit. It won't be\n, The PM’s lack of transparency in dealing with the troubled sports grants program deepens concerns about government accountability, Contact author, \n\nSun 2 Feb 2020 03.46 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 18.41 EST\n\n, Standards, Scott Morrison told us on the Sunday afternoon before the opening of federal parliament for 2020, are about accountability., Except, self-evidently, when standards are not about accountability; when standards are actually about shifting the goalposts so you can get through the latest debacle., Like when a prime minister, in this case – exactly the same prime minister dropping the piety about standards being about accountability – declines point blank to be accountable, declines to release new advice completely at odds with the auditor general’s assessment of the stinky debacle that is the sports grants program., If you are catching up with this saga, just quickly – we’ve had the ANAO assessment of the program (which was bad) and now the adjudication by Phil Gaetjens, Morrison’s former chief of staff, now departmental head (which was bad enough for Bridget McKenzie to take one for the team, but not bad enough for anyone else to be inconvenienced)., And when I say these two assessments of what went on with the administration of this program are completely at odds, I mean there is a chasm between the Gaetjens view of the appropriateness of what went on, and the verdict by the ANAO., It is daylight and moonlight., At least I think the two assessments are daylight and moonlight. But, honestly, I don’t know, because Morrison declined to release the Gaetjens adjudication., Morrison just read out bits of it. A few sentences, at a clip that suggested he had one eye on his notes and the other on the exit., Morrison also read out bits of what the attorney general, Christian Porter, said in order to counter the ANAO’s opinion that the grants made under the program were not only skewed towards targeted seats, they may not have been made with appropriate legal authority – which I explained on Saturday was a troubling proposition for a bunch of reasons bigger than one summer sports rorts saga, and “to Bridget or not to Bridget”., I wondered how the government might square this particular circle. Apparently Porter told Morrison that after having consulted the Australian Government Solicitor, the ANAO was quite wrong about the lack of legal authority question. “With respect.” The end., Sorry, what, prime minister, can we see that advice? The response to that was talk to the hand. The response later from the Morrison office was no one releases that kind of advice. No one. The end., I mean seriously? This is the response? When there are big issues at stake, bigger than the dog ate my homework, or the grants were allocated on colour-coded spreadsheets tying in with a targeted seats strategy before the election, or whether someone inside the National party room will have a tantrum if they have to lose their job and someone else gets it?, This is the response? When people are looking at the whole institution of government and wondering if the whole thing is entirely off the rails – the antidote to this corrosive distrust is sending McKenzie out the door with a tight smile and a light shove, and declining to be transparent about how a program can be a debacle according to the auditor general and a just flesh wound according to the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet?, In what universe does that address the underlying issues? In what universe does that response satisfy voters that governance in this country is OK, and proceeding in an orderly and competent fashion, in the interests of people, whether they live in a marginal seat, or whether they don’t., Morrison wants this whole mess to be over with McKenzie’s departure., Quick prediction., This isn’t over., Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editorscott morrison wants the sports rorts mess to be over with mckenzies exit it wont be", "label": 0}, "train-106": {"text": "NSW and Canberra fires: more homes reported lost as wind and thunderstorms hit, Bega Valley mayor Kristy McBain says more than 400 properties have been lost after 34 days of bushfire activity, Strong winds and thunderstorms across New South Wales were generating dangerous conditions for firefighters on Sunday evening as more homes were reported lost in the Bega Valley., Cooler temperatures forecast for Monday and the chance of substantial rain was giving fire authorities hope that conditions would ease on the other side of a cool change in the weather., On Sunday morning, NSW Health told residents in several parts of the state to restrict outdoor activities after bushfire smoke and dust caused air quality problems., In the Bega Valley in south-eastern NSW, the 177,000-hectare Border fire pushed north late on Saturday, while three other blazes in the south-west had merged into one., The Bega Valley shire council mayor, Kristy McBain, said on Sunday more than 400 properties and homes had been lost after 34 days of fire activity in her area., An unconfirmed number of homes were lost in Wyndham and Tantawangalo in the latest blazes., She said: “It’s hard for people because this has been going on for 34 days and counting.

In a statement she said she accepted the findings of Morrison’s departmental head. “I maintain that at no time did my membership of shooting sports clubs influence my decision making, nor did I receive any personal gain., “However, I acknowledge that my failure to declare my memberships in a timely manner constituted a breach of the prime minister’s ministerial standards,” she said., “Elected representatives are responsible for public expenditure and take advice, not direction, from the public service and others. The operation of ministerial discretion is important to our democratic process.”, While the Australian National Audit Office said grants were skewed to marginal seats, and the process was not informed by an appropriate assessment process or sound advice, Morrison said Gaetjens found no evidence that the process was “unduly influenced by reference to marginal or targeted electorates”., Morrison said his departmental head found “no basis for this suggestion that political considerations were the primary determining factor” in awarding the grants. He also said the advice from the secretary was the minister had used her discretion to make funding decisions appropriately., The prime minister said the government would accept recommendation four of the ANAO report, which advised the government to amend the Commonwealth Grant Rules and Guidelines “to require that the advising, decision-making and reporting requirements applying to situations where a minister approves grant funding be extended to apply to corporate Commonwealth entities in situations where a minister, rather than the corporate entity, is the decision-maker”., The ANAO said making that change “would mean that there would be a single framework in place for all circumstances where a minister decides upon the award of grant funding”., In addition to the sharp criticism about process, the ANAO raised another significant issue – whether the grants made by McKenzie were made with proper legal authority. Morrison referred that issue to the attorney general, Christian Porter, for advice., The prime minister said on Sunday that Porter had told him the auditor general was wrong in his assessment that the grants made under the program were legally questionable. Quoting Porter, Morrison told reporters that the auditor’s commentary about the potential legal exposure was, “with respect, not correct”., McKenzie’s resignation from the frontbench means the Nationals will have to select a new deputy leader. While the Queensland frontbencher David Littleproud is the likely replacement, there is deep irritation in Nationals ranks that media reports last week pointed to a deal to replace McKenzie with Littleproud before the issue had been properly considered by the Nationals party room., Morrison made it clear on Sunday he did not see McKenzie’s departure as the trigger for a broader reshuffle of his senior team despite the fact there is dissatisfaction inside the government about the performance of the embattled energy minister, Angus Taylor., The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, welcomed McKenzie stepping aside. But he said the opposition intended to get to the bottom of the imbroglio. “This scandal is bigger than one minister, and we still need to get to the bottom of these tawdry sports rorts,” the Labor leader said., “This scandal characterises everything that’s wrong with this government – one that is all about its own interests and not the national interest.

He did not appear in court and did not apply for bail, which was formally refused by magistrate John McIntosh., He’s scheduled to return to Parramatta local court on 2 April., Emergency services were called to Oatlands, near Parramatta, at about 8pm on Saturday, following reports that several people had been struck by a vehicle, including children who were riding bikes., Four of the children died at the scene, police said. A fifth child, 11, was taken to the Children’s hospital at Westmead in a critical condition but is now in a serious but stable condition., Two other girls, aged 10 and 13, suffered minor injuries.

He declared politicians should be in command, not bureaucrats., “The fever of dissent is used for tactical political advantage by some and by the bureaucracy to deter any minister in the future of doing anything away from what they are advised to do,” Joyce said. “This divests the parliament of its proper powers.”, Morrison is expected to receive advice imminently from his departmental head and former chief of staff, Phil Gaetjens, who has been examining whether there has been a breach of ministerial standards. The prime minister will want the imbroglio resolved before the new parliamentary session opens this week., Frydenberg would not say on Sunday morning whether McKenzie should stay or go. He also declined to say who should replace McKenzie as the deputy Nationals leader in the event she steps aside, arguing venturing an opinion would be like asking “a rabbi to be in the conclave choosing the pope”., There is deep irritation in Nationals ranks that media reports last week have pointed to a deal to replace McKenzie with the Queensland frontbencher David Littleproud before the issue has been properly considered by the Nationals party room., Both the Liberal and National parties become irritated when there is seen to be interference in their internal processes. Some Nationals predict if McKenzie goes, the deputy leadership would be contested rather than handed to Littleproud in a deal., The treasurer was pressed repeatedly on Sunday to admit that the behaviour evidenced through the management of the sports grants scheme was blatant pork barrelling. Frydenberg declined to make that admission., He said as a consequence of this case study, the government had already resolved to change the way sports grants programs were administered. “You will see more accountability, more transparency, more explanation of reasons, and they will be documented.”, “What it will mean for the government going forward is that when you have a corporate commonwealth entity like Sports Australia and the decision maker is the minister, the reasons will have to be documented for decisions, and that includes reasons for approving projects that weren’t recommended.”, It is unclear how Frydenberg’s comments sit with analysis from the ANAO that the minister lacked legal authority to make the grants, or with observations from constitutional law experts including academic Anne Twomey that the community sport infrastructure grant program was unconstitutional., The attorney general, Christian Porter, has been examining the legal questions flagged by the ANAO, but not the question of constitutionality., Frydenberg said the government would not look to fund programs that had missed out because the government skewed grants towards targeted seats, but instead look at funding a new program in this year’s budget., “What the prime minister has foreshadowed is given the strong community need and the importance of supporting these sporting organisations, we would, in the context of the budget, revisit a program of this type,” the treasurer said.sports rort dutton backs beleaguered mckenzie saying ive got confidence in bridget", "label": 0}, "train-111": {"text": "\nMichael McCormack sees off Barnaby Joyce in National party leadership spill\n, McCormack says he doesn’t expect Joyce to be challenge again after narrowly defeating him, with David Littleproud elected as his new deputy • McCormack re-elected as National party leader after spill – latest updates, \nSarah Martin Chief political correspondent, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 18.47 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 23.29 EST\n\n, Nationals leader Michael McCormack fended off a leadership challenge from Barnaby Joyce in a partyroom spill on Tuesday, declaring he expected his party to now focus on the interests of regional and rural Australians., The drought minister, David Littleproud, was appointed as deputy party leader to replace the outgoing Bridget McKenzie., McCormack, who narrowly survived the leadership strike, said his position had now been endorsed three times in the past two years and he did not expect Joyce to challenge again., “I don’t expect him to. I’ve been endorsed as leader. I was endorsed as leader when we came back here after the May election last year I was endorsed as leader when he stood down in 2018,” McCormack said., “That’s three times in less than two years. I think that is enough to warrant me leading the party going forward.”, “We will continue as a united team, to put the people of regional Australia first and foremost.”, Joyce congratulated McCormack, but defended his decision to challenge for the role., “It is appropriate that if an issue needs resolving as to contentions held, there is a procedure to resolve it as is noted in our parliamentary system,” Joyce said in a statement., “That process has been followed and the issue is finalised. This was made as brief as possible prior to the first sitting of Parliament for the year., “I support the vote of the room and will strive for the re-election of a Morrison McCormack Government as this is definitely the better outcome for Australia and especially of regional people.”, Joyce said that he would return his “first attentions” back to where they were before this week: “New England, drought, fires and now the threat of Coronavirus”., Calling for the party to now “draw a line in the sand”, McCormack blamed media speculation and unsourced reports for the latest bout of leadership instability and urged a focus on the fire victims for the first day of the parliamentary year., “There’s been many who have lost loved ones. Our thoughts go to them. There’s been many who lost their businesses, their homes, lost their farms. That’s the people we’re going to be concentrating on., “The people of regional Australia come first, not us. We’re sent here to do the job and we will do that.”, Whip Damian Drum would not reveal the result of the ballot of the party’s 21 MPs and senators, but sources suggested the vote was a narrow 11-10 victory. Others claimed Joyce only secured six votes, with McCormack securing a solid 15., Littleproud was elected deputy in a three-way contest with Queenslander Keith Pitt and NSW MP David Gillespie., Before the spill, Joyce said he was confident of being able to take back the top job, saying he was concerned McCormack was not providing adequate leadership in the bush., He flagged that if elected he would renegotiate a stronger Coalition agreement that would include more coal-fired power and a shake-up of the management of the Murray Darling basin with a “better basin plan”., “I’ll be looking at the issues of resources and power and energy prices, especially to the north,’’ he said., “I’ve been in politics longer than Scott Morrison, and I’ve been in leadership longer than Scott Morrison … I know how to deal at the highest level. I’ve been at the table, and for our team, for the Nationals team, if I’m given the opportunity, the great honour to do that again, I will.”, Joyce had the public backing of several MPs, including Queensland senator Matt Canavan, who who offered his resignation from cabinet in a tactical move on Monday night to support Joyce in the spill., When asked if the former resources minister would be returned to cabinet, McCormack said Canavan had tendered his resignation, and “I wish him all the best”., With McKenzie’s departure this leaves two cabinet positions to be filled by McCormack in a reshuffle of the Nationals front bench, with Victorian MP Darren Chester first in line for promotion., Pitt, the MP for the seat of Hinkler, is also in the running for a new role., McKenzie has retained the position of party leader in the Senate, despite losing her cabinet position and role as deputy leader., Littleproud, who was promoted to cabinet in his first term, said he was “proud” to be elected the party’s deputy and declared the “shenanigans are over”., “It’s time to get back to looking after those people that are facing drought, that have faced up to the fires. It’s time for us to focus on them, not us,” Littleproud said., Earlier, Scott Morrison said the leadership issue would be resolved “very promptly” and insisted the Coalition remained stable., “The Coalition is between the Liberals and Nationals and that Coalition has always provided very stable and very good government for this country,” the prime minister said.michael mccormack barnaby joyce national party leadership spill", "label": 0}, "train-112": {"text": "\n'I'm not relying on evidence' for climate change: Jim Molan angers audience in new-look Q&amp;A\n, Liberal senator derided by scientist Michael Mann as Hamish Macdonald settles into role as new host, \nAmanda Meade, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 15.36 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 15.38 EST\n\n, Q&amp;A Mark II made its debut on Monday night with the newly minted host Hamish Macdonald putting his stamp on the program with an emotive episode about the bushfires, but the headlines went to Liberal senator Jim Molan for his comments that he was “not relying on evidence” to form an opinion about climate change., #QandA is live from Queanbeyan, NSW with @KristyMcBain, @AndrewConstance, @V_Steffensen, Cheryl McCarthy, @MichaelEMann and @JimMolan https://t.co/rvDrv5FZYW, The audience was filled with people who had been affected by the unprecedented fires on the south coast of New South Wales and the emotion on display was raw both on and off the stage., The member for Bega, Andrew Constance, evoked sympathy for revealing he was traumatised by fighting fires and needed counselling., Every politician in Australia should take note careful note of how it sounds when one of their own speaks honestly and from the heart versus just turning up and trying to hit talking points. #QandA, “To your point about mental health, Hamish, I’m the first to put my hand up,” Constance said. “I’ve cried, I’ve been hugged, I’ve been loved, but the trauma of this is so profound and it’s affecting thousands of people across our regions and we need help.”,  Liberal senator Jim Molan elicited howls of anger from the audience for saying climate change may not be caused by humans and he was keeping an “open mind”., “I accept the climate is changing,” Molan said. “It has changed and it will change. What it’s producing is hotter and drier weather and a hotter and drier country., “As to whether it is human-induced climate change … my mind is open.”, Macdonald, who has replaced Tony Jones after 12 years as Q&amp;A host, indicated he intends to be a more interventionist host, frequently asking follow-up questions of the panellists, at times conducting his own interrogation., It’s a departure from what founding executive producer Peter McEvoy believed was a platform for the public to ask questions of guests., Macdonald got into a lengthy stoush with Molan, asking him more than half a dozen questions, which was brought to an end by another panellist, Bega mayor Kristy McBain: “Can I bring it back to Serena’s question?”, What an outstanding episode of #qanda tonight.

The visit was made to the soccer club, while according to Sport Australia the grant was awarded to the umbrella organisation – Caboolture Sports Club Inc – for new cricket facilities., Longman was one of the Labor party’s most marginal seats, held by Susan Lamb on a 0.8% margin., Morrison has repeatedly denied that the controversial sports grants program was used by the Coalition to pork-barrel marginal and targeted seats, despite the findings of the auditor general who revealed that the then sport minister Bridget McKenzie selected projects from a list colour-coded by which party held the electorate in which they were located., But the Nationals MP Damien Drum conceded on Monday the program was deployed “to maximise” the Coalition’s performance at the last federal election., In comments defending the performance of McKenzie, who has resigned her frontbench position following the sports grants controversy, Drum said of the program: “It might have been used, you may be right, it may have been used not so much marginal seats but trying to maximise the performance at the last election.”, Drum argued McKenzie had been correct to allocate the grants rather than follow the recommendations of Sport Australia. “We want a government that has ministers that lead their departments. We don’t want to have a government where a department, faceless bureaucrats, lead the ministers.”, He said politicians should make decisions about funding allocations “because a bureaucrat doesn’t understand the communities”., “A bureaucrat doesn’t understand one particular project may have an enormous amount of community in-kind support, a minister who has been there on site would understand that., “I don’t think bias in government spending is anything new.”, Young did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment, while a spokesman for the Liberal party said Hirst had no role in deciding where grants were awarded., “The Liberal party federal secretariat was not involved in any decisions relating to the Community Sports Infrastructure program.”, Despite attempting to draw a line over the controversy with McKenzie’s departure from the frontbench, the Morrison government remains under pressure because of the sports grants controversy., Labor will move on Wednesday to establish a select committee to examine the process surrounding the allocation of grants, with crossbench support., Legal experts, including Anne Twomey, have raised doubts about McKenzie’s legal authority to administer the grants program., One of the country’s leading constitutional experts, Twomey said on Monday that while ministers had discretion to direct their departments, this did not apply to corporate entities such as Sport Australia., “If we were being charitable to Senator McKenzie (and every other minister spouting about ministerial discretion) we could say that she was confused and really thought the same rules applied to making these sporting grants as would normally apply in relation to a departmental grant program,” Twomey wrote for the ABC., “Perhaps somehow she was not informed that she had only limited legal powers in relation to the Sport Australia, despite it pointing this out. But even if this was so, she must still have known and believed she was subject to … constraints.”, The Liberal trade minister, Simon Birmingham, told ABC’s 7.30 program on Monday that ministers were not there to “rubber stamp” recommendations made by the department, but said he had never chosen projects from a spreadsheet colour-coded by electorate., Pressed if McKenzie had done anything wrong, Birmingham noted that she had resigned “as a result” of the analysis of the auditor general, but more specifically because of her lack of compliance with the ministerial code of conduct., “Clearly a mistake was made.

A result should be known by 10.30am., Late on Monday, Canavan said he would support Joyce because the party needed to “fight a bit harder” and “shout a bit louder”., “I do think a change of direction here will allow us to do that better for our constituents,” Canavan said., Explaining his decision, Canavan said that regional Australians had “struggled to get our voice heard” and the Nationals needed to stop “city-based commentators” dominating debates affecting regional constituents, such as the future of coal., Canavan said he would not stand for deputy, and it would be up to McCormack and Scott Morrison if he could return to the ministry in the event Joyce was unsuccessful., Nationals MPs will also vote on a replacement for McKenzie as deputy, with several MPs expected to run, including the New South Wales MP David Gillespie, the drought minister, David Littleproud, and the Queensland MP Keith Pitt., The position will be decided by a series of ballots that eliminate one unsuccessful nominee each round., After declaring there was “no vacancy” for his position, McCormack insisted he maintained the support of his colleagues., “I have the overwhelming majority support in the party room and of course I’m going to continue as the Nationals party leader as my colleagues want and, I think, as regional Australians expect,” he said., “I have delivered for rural and regional Australia.”, The Victorian Nationals MP Darren Chester said McCormack had the “overwhelming support” of the party room and was doing a good job “delivering for regional Australians”., “What’s damaging is any second, minute, hour, day the National party talks about itself and doesn’t talk about the issues affecting regional Australians,” Chester told the ABC., The Nationals federal president, Larry Anthony, told ABC that the bout of instability in the junior coalition partner was “democracy in action”., He also acknowledged that there was “discontent” in regional Australia about the government’s response to the summer bushfire season which had been directed to Canberra., “I think it’s been a very difficult summer. Out in regional Australia a lot of people are hurting. A lot of it, it’s not caused by us, it’s the forces of nature, but naturally, you know, they’re looking to Canberra.”, He also said he would support whoever was successful in Tuesday’s ballot., While announcing his support for Joyce, Canavan also revealed that he had failed to disclose he is a regional supporter of the North Queensland Cowboys, entitled to a membership of its leagues club. In November the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) gave a loan to the North Queensland Cowboys Football club., Canavan claimed the undisclosed interest – which he only recalled in the last week – did not constitute a breach of ministerial standards because he had “no influence or control” over which projects Naif decided to fund, only a power to reject loans. He said he had sought advice from the prime minister’s office about the issue., The club was granted a $20m loan under the Naif for a community, training and high performance centre next to its stadium in Townsville, on top of a $15m grant extended in March 2019., In November the Cowboys noted that the Naif investment decision “is subject to the minister for northern Australia, Matt Canavan’s legislative consideration period and the finalisation of the Queensland Government’s consideration of the project”., When the $15m grant was announced in March, Canavan was quoted boasting that the “investment will mean Townsville has world class facilities for multiple sports” in addition to rugby league., When asked about the Nationals leadership spill, the Liberal minister Simon Birmingham said McCormack was “an outstanding leader” who had been a strong advocate for regional Australia.matt canavan quits cabinet to back barnaby joyce for national party leadership", "label": 0}, "train-116": {"text": "Michael McCormack's job under threat with Nationals spill motion likely to be moved – as it happened, Party tensions come to boil as Richard Di Natale shocks Canberra by standing down as Greens leader.

If Bridget did that ... she’s probably guilty of making the same mistake, that every government has made ever since the federation has been enacted. , And, as I said in earlier interviews, I was in the Victorian government and the Victorian parliament for 14 years.

The fact she was a member of a shooting club, didn’t disclose that on time. Used to discretion probably too much. She has borne the brunt and taken the cost of all of that, she has paid a very heavy price. , A very smart hard-working and tenacious minister has paid the ultimate price*.

The then Labor leader, Bill Shorten, attacked the preference deal, prompting Palmer to claim that Labor had also approached him to strike a deal., During the campaign Palmer and his lead New South Wales candidate, Brian Burston, boasted that Palmer would spend $60m or more on his own campaign. A week out from the 18 May election a Facebook account linked to the UAP paid to disseminate an ad for the Queensland LNP., After Labor’s shock loss, Palmer said he had intentionally polarised the electorate with anti-Labor ads labelling Bill Shorten “shifty” in the dying weeks of the campaign., The post-election reviews conducted by Labor and the Australian Council of Trade Unions both blamed Palmer’s ad spend for the result. In the last week of the campaign alone UAP spent $8m on advertising., Analysis from the Grattan Institute suggests Palmer tried to “buy the election” with a $90m spend, largely made up of the $83.3m donation from Mineralogy., “This is the single biggest donation on record, way above the previous record of $15 million – also held by Palmer – at the 2013 election,” senior associate Kate Griffiths said. “The largest non-Palmer donation ever was $4 million from a private investor and philanthropist.”, In addition to $330,000 given to the National party, Anna Palmer also gave $20,000 to Cherish Life Queensland, an anti-abortion group which campaigned against Labor’s plan to improve access to abortion., The United Australia party’s declaration also revealed that on 30 June it owed Google Australia $8.2m. Google accepts political advertising both in its search functions and other digital platforms including YouTube., A spokesperson for UAP reportedly told the ABC the bill had been “paid in full as per Google’s terms and conditions”. Palmer told Guardian Australia “that is not a matter for me”., In addition to $83.3m from Mineralogy, the UAP declared a $106,342 donation from Waratah Coal Pty Ltd and $53,566 from Palmer Coolum Resort Pty Ltd., Palmer’s vast campaign spend – which included more on advertising than McDonald’s, Toyota and Coles in the year before the election – prompted calls for spending caps and greater transparency and regulation of donations., His advertising push, in part, relied on a large network of Facebook pages, which pushed out anti-Shorten and other material to users via paid advertisements., Much of that material was created at the Coolum resort, where Palmer launched his campaign, and flew in a huge cohort of candidates for a three-day workshop. While at the resort, the candidates filmed scripted, word-for-word videos decrying the foreign ownership of Australian ports, and linking it to “border security” and stopping “leaky boats”., The Palmer money added to an already large expenditure by the major parties. Centre for Public Integrity analysis suggests that major party spending was the highest in real terms since the 2007 election, at $102m. That is below only the expenditure recorded in 2008, when the major parties spent $127.8m, adjusting for inflation., The donations data also reveal the individuals bankrolling Advance Australia, the rightwing version of GetUp. Advance Australia campaigned against Labor during the election., It spent almost $2m during the campaign and has declared $1.1m in donations, including large contributions from a cluster of companies which corporate records link to the wealthy O’Neil family in Double Bay, Sydney, who made much of their fortune in property development., Advance Australia’s backers also include the founder of medical technology company Resmed, Peter Farrell, who gave $50,000, and City Lodge Motel Pty Ltd, which appears to be linked to Brisbane businesswoman Kim Pradella.anna palmer gave nationals 330000 while clive palmer had preference deal with coalition", "label": 0}, "train-118": {"text": "\nI can't hate him, says Sydney mother of three children killed by alleged drink-driver\n, Leila Geagea says she forgives man accused of fatal crash but wants court ‘to be fair’, Australian Associated Press, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 01.10 EST\n\n,  The grief-stricken mother of three children killed at the hands of an alleged drink-driver has said she cannot hate the man who was behind the wheel., It is alleged that Samuel William Davidson, 29, was three times the legal blood alcohol limit on Saturday night when his ute hit and killed four children., Abdallah siblings Sienna, 8, Angelina, 12, and Antony, 13, died at the scene in the Sydney suburb of Oatlands alongside their cousin Veronique Sakr, 11., Leila Geagea, the mother of Sienna, Angelina and Antony, said she forgave Davidson as she visited the scene of the tragedy on Monday., “I think in my heart I forgive him.

He is currently serving a six-year sentence., In his submission, published in early January, Pell’s lawyers argue that, in the face of exculpatory evidence, the court of appeal relied on their “belief” in the complainant to eliminate doubt and uphold the conviction., “Any conflation of the concepts of ‘belief’ and ‘elimination of doubt’ is an attempt to fundamentally depart from the defining safeguards of the accusatorial system of criminal justice,” the submission from Bret Walker SC said. “These safeguards protect people from the risk of being wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit.”, Victoria’s Director of Public Prosecutions rejected this argument in documents now published by the high court. “The applicant suggests that the majority proceeded on the basis of ‘believing’ the victim – that this was ‘the end’ of the majority’s enquiry,” wrote the Victorian Director of Public of Prosecutions, Kerri Judd QC., “The majority did not reason on the basis of ‘belief’ in the victim. Rather, they ‘reviewed the whole of the evidence’ and made an ‘assessment of the victim’s credibility and reliability’.”, In December 2018, a jury in the county court of Victoria returned a unanimous guilty verdict on five charges, finding that Pell had sexually abused two 13-year-old choirboys St Patrick’s Cathedral after catching them drinking sacramental wine in the priests’ sacristy. He assaulted one of them again a few weeks later., Judd said the submission from Pell’s legal team “disregards” evidence that supported the victim’s account, including his accurate description of the sacristy. Two of the three appeal court judges had described the complainant as a compelling, truthful witness., The majority of the court of appeal had not been “persuaded that the jury must have had a reasonable doubt about Pell’s guilt”, Judd said., “In addition, the majority formed the view on the whole of the evidence that they themselves did not experience a doubt about Pell’s guilt.”, The full court will hear the case in Canberra on 11 March., In Australia, Blue Knot Foundation can be contacted on 1300 657 380 or at www.blueknot.org.au; Bravehearts Inc, which offers counselling and support for survivors and child protection advocacy, can be contacted on 1800 272 831; 1800 Respect is a 24-hour telephone and online crisis support service available on 1800 737 732 or at www.1800respect.org.au; for 24-hour crisis support and suicide prevention call Lifeline on 13 11 14 or visit www.lifeline.org.au., • This article was amended on Wednesday 5 February 2020.

All leadership positions have been spilled, and the Greens will determine their new leadership team on Tuesday., The deputy leadership of the party in recent times has been shared by Adam Bandt and Larissa Waters, who are both logical contenders to replace the Victorian in the top job., Bandt confirmed shortly after Di Natale’s announcement that he would seek the party leadership, and won public backing from Tasmanian Nick McKim., I will be standing for Greens Leader.Thank you Richard for your leadership and service to Aust. I look forward to talking with my colleagues about how we share leadership across the House &amp; Senate as we fight the climate emergency and inequality with a Green New Deal., If Bandt is successful, that would see the party leadership transferred to the lower house rather than the Senate. It is possible senators Mehreen Faruqi and Sarah Hanson-Young could also seek a leadership role., Faruqi took to social media after Di Natale’s announcement to say she had consistently supported Greens members having a democratic say in the selection of the party leader. She said she also supported co-leaders., “Selecting our new leader is a great opportunity to democratically involve members in the process,” Faruqi said. “The party should be doing just that for this ballot”., The positioning references an unresolved internal debate within the Greens about giving grass roots members a say in selecting leaders – a debate that has continued unresolved for several years., Di Natale told the party’s national conference in 2016 that the party should consider democratising leadership ballots but the model is not yet agreed. Options include the party considering a direct vote of the membership, or a split vote of members and MPs similar to Labor’s model., The party is expected to reach a landing point over the coming months., Di Natale confirmed his intention to move on from public life in a Facebook post on Monday morning, saying he wanted to spend more time with his children., “My boys are nine and eleven years old now and they’ve only ever known their Dad as a busy and tired and sometimes grumpy politician,” he said. “They are growing up quickly, and I want to spend more time by their side than a relentless political schedule allows.” , Di Natale has given an undertaking to stay on for the transition and is expected to leave Canberra by the middle of the year., In his farewell post, Di Natale said a source of considerable pride was establishing “a world leading price on carbon in partnership with the Gillard government back in 2011”. He said that example showed Australia could reduce carbon emissions and take “real action on climate change, if we work together”., Di Natale said he remained confident Australia could move forward on climate change if people came together to demand change, and he said climate change would now be front and centre at every federal election. “The future is bright, the future is green.”richard di natale resigns as greens leader and announces he will leave politics", "label": 0}, "train-123": {"text": "\nLiberal party received $4.1m in donations from property tycoon's company\n, Amount donated is one of the largest in Australian political history, other than the $83.3m given by Mineralogy to Clive Palmer’s party, \nPaul Karp, \nChristopher Knaus and \nNick Evershed, \n\nSun 2 Feb 2020 20.05 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2020 20.51 EST\n\n, The Liberal party received $4.1m from a single donor before the 2019 election, one of the largest amounts in political history, dwarfing former leader Malcolm Turnbull’s $1.75m gift before the 2016 election., The donations, revealed in Australian Electoral Commission disclosures published on Monday, are second only to the $83.3m donated by Mineralogy Pty Ltd to Clive Palmer’s United Australia party., Both major parties also took significant sums of money from the fossil fuel industry, including multinational giant Woodside, something environmentalists say explains government inaction in the “face of a rolling national emergency driven by climate change”., The $4.1m donated to the federal Liberal party and its state branches was given in multiple instalments by Sugolena Pty Ltd, a company linked to philanthropist Isaac Wakil, who made his fortune in the clothing industry and invested heavily in property, with his wife Susan, around the Sydney suburb of Pyrmont., The Wakils owned a property portfolio worth $200m, which they began to sell in 2014 to fund their charitable foundation., Their philanthropy has included a $35m donation to the University of Sydney and $20m to the Art Gallery of New South Wales’ planned Sydney Modern wing – both the largest donations in those organisations’ history., The Liberals declared $22.6m in donations and Labor $18.2m. Total receipts, which include all donations regardless of the $13,800 reporting threshold, other payments, returns from financial investments and loans, amounted to $165m for the Liberals and $126m for Labor., Australia’s weak donation disclosure system continues to mask a huge chunk of political financing. Analysis by the Centre for Public Integrity shows that $1bn in party income has not been disclosed between 1999 and the last reporting year, almost 36% of total party financing., But the disclosures that have been made continue to show the significant influence of the fossil fuel industry in Australian democracy. Clive Palmer’s Mineralogy, which gave $83,681,442 to Palmer’s United Australia party, was by far the single biggest fossil fuel donor., An analysis by the Australian Conservation Foundation found a further $1.89m in fossil fuel donations to Australian political parties., “This data explains why even in the face of a rolling national emergency driven by climate change and community demands for change, the government continues to defend and promote the industries that are the root cause of the problem,” ACF’s economy and democracy program manager, Matt Rose, said., “Serious donations reform is needed now to make sure our political system works for the benefit of all Australians, not just those with the biggest wallets.”, The biggest fossil fuel donor to the major parties was Woodside, Australia’s biggest LNG exporter. It gave $135,400 to Labor, $136,750 to the Liberal party and $11,190 to the Nationals. The gas industry lobby, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), was also a significant donor., The prime minister, Scott Morrison, recently identified gas as a key “transition” fuel for Australia’s economy, saying “we need to get the gas from under our feet”. He also recently struck a $2bn deal with the New South Wales government to increase gas supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector., Donald Trump supporter and Australian rich lister Anthony Pratt continued to give generously in the election year. His company, Pratt Holdings, gave $1.3m to the federal Liberal party and $1.38m to Labor., The federal Liberal party also declared two donations from Adani Mining Pty Ltd totalling $50,000., Carmichael Rail Network, another wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Australia, gave $50,000 to the federal Liberal party and $100,000 to the Nationals., The major parties took more money from James Packer’s Crown Resorts, which was able to avoid a damaging parliamentary inquiry into allegations of corruption last year when both parties voted against it., Labor accepted $45,412 in Crown donations and the Liberals took $15,000., Parliament votes 127-5 against @WilkieMP's call for a parliamentary inquiry into Crown Resorts #auspol @SBSNews pic.twitter.com/eHxHuS4apg, The alcohol and gambling lobby continued to donate generously to both major parties., The various branches of the Australian Hotels Association gave $1.53m, the vast majority of which ($1.01m) went to Labor., Labor also took $321,508 from the Pharmacy Guild, a frequent donor on behalf of the influential pharmaceutical industry., Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of Labor’s election year funding came from unions, including the right-leaning Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, which gave Labor $1.6m in donations during the year., The Cormack Foundation, an associated entity of the Liberal party, gave $2.5m to the Victorian branch and $3.5m to the federal party., The Victorian Liberal party also declared $407,500 from the Bus Association of Victoria and $90,000 from the Chisholm MP, Gladys Liu., The NSW Liberal party declared $2.8m in donations, including $300,000 from Reg Grundy’s widow, Joy Chambers Grundy, $140,000 from Roslyn Packer and $110,000 from Meriton Property Services.

Hanson also gave the party $100,000 in “other receipts”., On 1 February, Adani Mining updated its disclosure for the preceding year (2017-18), removing a $15,000 donation it had declared to Pauline Hanson’s One Nation., Duncan Turpie, a reclusive mathematician, investor and high-end gambler, donated $450,000 to the Australian Greens., The NSW Greens declared a $298,602 donation from the estate of Alan Roberts.

He reported it to police the next day., “The significance of that is it was one of the subjects Mr Jubelin spoke to him about,” Hogan said., At times, a surveillance warrant and telephone intercept warrants were issued for Savage, but the prosecutor alleged Jubelin made four secret recordings which were not covered by them., He alleged Jubelin instructed another officer to record the first call, which Jubelin made from police headquarters using the speaker on the phone., He allegedly told the officer not to save the recording, but the officer placed it on the computer system., Two other calls were secretly made on Jubelin’s mobile phone at Savage’s house, but he later asked the officer to make transcripts of them saying they were under the warrants, Hogan said., Jubelin had admitted making the calls but “asserts the recordings were made to protect his lawful interests”, including for operational reasons., He said Savage previously complained about aspects of his August 2017 interview, saying the air-conditioning was too cold and he wasn’t given access to water., “Mr Jubelin cannot have a personal interest in a matter that arises out of a police investigation,” Hogan said., None of the conversations with Savage were urgent and could have been delayed to organise the appropriate warrants, he said., Detective Sergeant Laura Beacroft, who was part of the investigation into William’s disappearance, said further inquiries took place into Savage after he became a person of interest in March 2017., This included “numerous strategies devised to evoke some sort of reaction” from Savage., Tracking and listening devices, cameras and surveillance operatives using hand-held devices were used., “One of the issues was Mr Savage had a habit of listening to his radio very loudly” while static also was a problem in making audio recordings, she said., Jubelin had come up with the idea of placing the Spider-Man suit in the bush, she said., The hearing continues.spider man suit was planted as part of william tyrrell investigation court told", "label": 0}, "train-125": {"text": "Morning mail: Australian coronavirus cases hit 13, Iowa poll chaos, fish rescue, \nMorning mail: Australian coronavirus cases hit 13, Iowa poll chaos, fish rescue\n, Wednesday: an eight-year-old Chinese boy is in hospital with the latest confirmed case of the virus.

The boy is the youngest infected in Australia so far, and a Chinese citizen and from Wuhan. He was travelling in a group with a 44-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman who have been confirmed as Queensland’s other cases of coronavirus. The child remains in isolation at the Gold Coast University hospital in a stable condition. A group of 241 Australians have been moved into quarantine in the barely used immigration detention centre on Christmas Island. Some of those quarantined have complained the conditions in the detention centre are unhygienic, particularly the allocation of shared bathrooms, exacerbating the potential for transmission of an outbreak of coronavirus. Evacuee Belinda Chen told the ABC: “I understood that there would be very limited facilities here, but the actual condition is no facilities at all. It’s thousands of times worse than I imagined.”, Facebook has failed to stop a coordinated far-right operation profiting from disinformation and anti-Islamic hate almost two months after it was publicly exposed. The Guardian revealed in December that a network of Facebook’s largest far-right pages were part of a coordinated commercial enterprise that for years had been harvesting Islamophobic hate for profit, prompting promises from the social media giant that it would crack down on the network. Two months after Facebook was made aware of the scheme, an analysis by the Guardian has confirmed that a number of the pages are still feeding off anti-Islamic content to drive readers to the same for-profit, third-party websites., Democrats are heading to New Hampshire with no frontrunner after the Iowa debacle. The candidates had hoped the Iowa caucuses would begin to sort out a chaotic primary field, identifying clear frontrunners. Instead, Iowa was a disaster. As a mobile app meant to help steer organisers through the caucus turned out to be defective, the contest fell into confusion. “They couldn’t organise a caucus in a brewery. Or a church, or a library, or a school gymnasium. Democrats’ heroic charge to end Donald Trump in the final battle for decency and democracy has spiralled into vote-counting carnage and chaos,” writes David Smith. Here’s a quick guide to the chaos.

A desperate rescue mission to the only known habitat of the stocky galaxias, in Kosciuszko national park, may be the last hope for the species. The effect of the ash is compounded by dead leaves washing into waterways. As organic matter decomposes it draws oxygen from the water, potentially triggering mass fish kills. Ash and decomposing material have contributed to the death of thousands of native fish at more than 20 different locations across the Murray-Darling Basin and in coastal areas of NSW over the past fortnight., “Dark money” would be eliminated from Australian politics under a plan by senator Jacqui Lambie, which would require the declaration of multiple small donations and for fundraising dinners to be declared as gifts., Global heating is a serious threat to the world’s climate refuges.

The company has defined policies on coordinated inauthentic behaviour and inauthentic behaviour, which it generally describes as “groups of pages or people who work together to mislead others about who they are or what they’re doing”. This can be either ideologically or financially motivated., Coordinated inauthentic behaviour generally involves the use of fake accounts, and Facebook will generally take action on such networks over their deceptive conduct, rather than over the content of the posts themselves., In this case, the investigation is complicated by the fact that the Facebook pages spreading the disinformation have genuine, authentic administrators in Australia., Facebook is separately considering whether the individual posts detected by the Guardian breach any of its community standards, which include restrictions on hate speech., Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning, But Prof Axel Bruns, of the Queensland University of Technology’s digital media research centre, said there was simply no excuse for the company not to have done more to stop the network., “This is really obviously a clear-cut demonstrated case of coordinated posting activity across a number of pages, you’d expect Facebook to actually take steps against that, because it is the term that they’re using – coordinated inauthentic behaviour – it matches that description perfectly,” Bruns told Guardian Australia., “What happens with Facebook is that they tend to only act when something blows up big enough for them to be concerned with their public standing.”, Driven by a single Israel-based administrator, the network previously revealed by the Guardian operated by churning out thousands of coordinated fake news posts to more than 1 million followers across the globe each week, funnelling audiences to a cluster of 10 ad-heavy websites and milking the traffic for profit., The posts stoked anti-Islamic sentiment across the western world and influenced politics in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US by amplifying far-right parties such as Australia’s One Nation and vilifying Muslim politicians such as the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar and Australian senator Mehreen Faruqi., A spokesman for the Australian Imam’s Council said anti-Islamic sentiment and Islamophobia “has significantly increased in recent times” and that the content identified by the Guardian helped to “provoke and fuel hatred and abuse directed at Australian Muslims”., “The 2019 Islamophobia in Australia Report, produced by Charles Sturt University, found more than 70% of the 350 incidents considered involved abuse directed at Muslim women and girls,” the spokesman said., “Such conduct is facilitated and provoked by anti-Islamic content. The content which has been identified presents a significant threat and risk to the wellbeing of Australian Muslims. It not only exacerbates anti-Islamic sentiment and the associated risks, but provides an environment which enables and encourages hatred and abuse directed at Australian Muslims.”, It criticised social media platforms such as Facebook as being “necessarily reactive”, and said they helped “give rise to a risk to the wellbeing and safety of people and in turn cause division and hatred within our broader society, thereby threatening to tear it apart”., At the time, a number of the group’s targets criticised Facebook for allowing the network to operate under its nose. Faruqi told the Guardian the network represented a “new level of far-right organisation and coordination”, and accused Facebook of “profiteering from the proliferation of hate speech and abuse”., “Facebook could do much more and shut these pages down but so long as they continue to profit from the reach and engagement, they don’t seem to be interested in decisive action,” she said., Similarly, Omar labelled the company “a threat to our democracy”., “It has become clear that they do not take seriously the degree to which they provide a platform for white nationalist hate and dangerous misinformation in this country and around the world,” she said., “And there is a clear reason for this: they profit off it. I believe their inaction is a grave threat to people’s lives, to our democracy and to democracy around the world.”, • This article was updated on 20 February 2020.

But when tickets were issued by traffic cameras, Aboriginal drivers received slightly fewer penalties on average than non-Aboriginal drivers., The five-year analysis included 69% of all drivers in WA, and showed a “notable ethnic disparity” in the issuing of traffic fines., However, police said they had not acted on the report because decisions on what actions would be taken to reduce Aboriginal incarceration were a matter for cabinet., On average, the report found, Aboriginal drivers in WA receive 1.75 times more penalty units over their lifetime of driving than non-Aboriginal drivers. That is about $1,260 more in fines for Aboriginal drivers, “almost entirely driven by police-initiated, on-the-spot infringements”., It also found Aboriginal drivers were carrying 6.2 times more unpaid fines — amounting to a debt of $2,327., Until last year, police in Western Australia had the power to arrest and jail people for unpaid court fines – and accumulated traffic offences can often end up in court. Drivers with unpaid fines cannot renew their licence, and repeatedly driving unlicensed can result in jail time., “These differences are large enough to suggest an uncomfortable distinction between automated camera and police-initiated traffic enforcement, with this distinction heavily correlated with Aboriginality,” the report by WA Police’s then director of criminology, Dr Geoffrey Barnes, said., The final report was dated 13 February 2019, and recommended further investigation of the “clearly disturbing” trend, concluding: “These findings are consistent with a notable ethnic disparity in police-initiated traffic enforcement, but by no means provide conclusive evidence that deliberate bias exists.”, Barnes, who joined WA Police as its first in-house criminologist in May 2017, said the research was unique because traffic cameras provided a control group., “We know that automated traffic enforcement doesn’t detect the difference between the two ethnic groups,” he told Guardian Australia. “Therefore, if we’re only finding it in stops, well that that is an indication that there’s a discretionary element going on … Even if it’s not racism, we don’t want this pattern to exist.”, Barnes said the evidence-based policing unit began to lose resources in December 2018, when the deputy commissioner Stephen Brown, who established the unit, left the force. By the time Barnes left WA Police, on 16 January this year, he said he was effectively the only one left. The only person who tried to get traction on his reports was his boss, the assistant commissioner Craig Ward., Ward commissioned the report and presented it to a working group on Aboriginal wellbeing, set up to report to cabinet on the McGowan government’s pledge to reduce the number of Aboriginal people in custody., He told Guardian Australia that the decision to respond to the report would be a matter for cabinet and that WA police no longer had the staff to do the follow-up research that Barnes recommend., “That’s not with any intention to cover it up,” Ward said. “I think it’s frankly a fantastic report and asks us the kind of questions we need to face ... but it was about trying to get the best outcome and the best audience at government level to receive this so we could have a whole-of-government outcome.”, Dennis Eggington, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (ALSWA), said the report, shown to him by Guardian Australia, contained “no surprises, no shocks,” but he was disappointed it had not been acted on., “It just confirms what we as Aboriginal people know and are subjected to,” he said. “I certainly now will be taking the issue up with our police commissioner here in WA to see whether or not we can all work together with the information there to help make things better.”, Police in Australia have the power to stop any driver, at any time, to conduct a random breath test, even if they can’t see any offences occurring. It’s a discretionary power, and one Eggington said every Aboriginal person he knows has experienced., “It happens all the time,” he said. “It happens personally to me, it’s happened personally to all my family members.”, Eggington said WA police had problems with racism, both systemic and personal, but that the relationship between ALSWA and police had improved., “All colonial institutions have a problem with systemic racism,” he said., Ward said the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in police-led infringements could be due to a lack of traffic cameras in regional areas, meaning most infringements were issued directly by police. He also said that when police pulled someone over they could issue fines for more than one thing., “If it’s a three-car family from the western suburbs, and you’re driving along in your Land Cruiser and you’re the only person in the car speeding because you can and that’s your car, it stops there,” Ward said. “If you’re driving from the remote Pilbara community of Jigalong to Newman and you have pulled over and there’s 10 people in the car, and it’s unroadworthy, and you haven’t got a licence and the car’s not registered, that’s a different outcome.”, Barnes said a number of sworn police officers described similar scenarios in which extra demerit points might be accumulated by Aboriginal drivers., “Believe me I heard all kinds of assumptive arguments when I wrote this,” he said. “But in the end we have this aggregate trend.”, Aboriginal drivers in regional areas received 4.2 times more penalty units from police stops than non-Indigenous drivers, and 41% of all traffic infringements to Aboriginal drivers were issued in regional areas, the report found., The biggest disparity was in the issuing of infringements for not wearing a seatbelt, where Aboriginal drivers received 19.2 times the number of fines., Asked whether the report showed evidence of structural racism in WA police, Ward said that was “certainly something that I thought initially”., But he said he then concluded the disparity was due to government policies for police to target certain types of offences. “Police officers will pretty much follow instructions,” he said., WA police has, in recent years, made efforts to repair its relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, starting with an apology from the commissioner, Chris Dawson, for “past wrongful actions”, issuing Aboriginal service medals to police officers and staff, and a focus on recruiting Aboriginal cadets., Ward said WA police had an “internal communication journey to go on to make sure everyone is on board” with that agenda., “What we do not want to do, as I said, is make a kneejerk response to this, walk around accusing people of unconscious bias or whatever it may be that may set our agenda backwards,” he said.aboriginal drivers in wa more likely to get fines from police officers than traffic cameras", "label": 0}, "train-128": {"text": "\n'Open to corruption': Jacqui Lambie plans to end flow of 'dark money' to political parties\n, The senator will introduce a private bill to drastically tighten rules on political donations , \nPaul Karp, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 11.32 EST\n\n, “Dark money” would be eliminated from Australian politics under a plan by senator Jacqui Lambie to require the declaration of multiple small donations and for fundraising dinners to be declared as gifts., Lambie will release a private senator’s bill to reform donations on Wednesday, proposing a system of real-time disclosure and lowering the threshold for disclosure from $13,800 a year to $2,500 every six months., On Monday the Australian Electoral Commission revealed the Liberals had collected a total of $165m in the financial year ending June 2018, of which $22.6m was donations above the threshold. Labor received $126m, of which $18.2m was donations above the threshold., Donations disclosure reform is an area ripe for cooperation between opposition and crossbench parties, with private member’s bills lodged by both Labor and Centre Alliance proposing lowering the disclosure threshold to donations of $1,000 or more., However, such proposals require government agreement to be debated in the lower house, even if they pass the Senate., Lambie’s bill would require aggregation of donations, so that multiple gifts from the same source to the same recipient must be disclosed if the sum is greater than or equal to the threshold., Lambie told Guardian Australia “the problem is when you give a donation under $14,000, you can give that every day for seven days and don’t have to write any of that down”., Parties declared less than one third of what they got, she said. “It’s way too loose, it’s open to corruption … by these lobbyists that come up here.”, In 2018 the Grattan Institute calculated that Australian political parties earned more than $62m in so-called dark money from untraceable sources, including donations below the threshold and “other receipts” such as money from fundraising dinners or returns on investment., Lambie’s bill would also require:, Disclosure within seven days of any gift that tips a donor over the threshold of $2,500 or more in a six-month period, and any gifts thereafter, Revenue from the sale of tickets to fundraising dinners or related events and membership fees to parties or associated entities to be reported as political donations by expanding the definition of a gift, Explanation of the reason for other funds being paid to a political party, Political bodies to only make campaign expenditure from a nominated bank account, Lambie said attendees at fundraising dinners paid $10,000 and got “soggy chips and overcooked steak” not “crayfish wrapped in gold” because “they’re coming to buy influence”., Lambie said voters should be able to read disclosures on an open portal to “see if there’s any pattern of behaviour”, such as major donations around the time of contentious bills., “When it comes to the pokies, you can see that both Liberal and Labor are same-same on them – they don’t give a stuff how much destruction they’re doing to people in society, because they’re getting pay cheques from those people they shut up.”, Lambie cited major donations by the Australian Hotel Association, which gave $1.53m in the last financial year, the majority ($1.01m) to Labor; and Crown, which gave $45,412 to Labor and $15,000 to the Liberals., Major parties raise money from corporations through associated entities like the Federal Labor Business Forum and the Australian Business Network, which sell memberships that entitle companies to access senior federal politicians for up to $25,000., In September Channel Nine caused controversy when it hosted a $10,000-a-head corporate fundraising dinner for the Liberal Party., In submissions to a Senate inquiry the Minerals Council of Australia has conceded it makes political donations and pays to attend fundraisers to gain access to members of parliament.open to corruption jacqui lambie plans to end flow of dark money to political parties", "label": 0}, "train-129": {"text": "\nIs the Australian government really ‘meeting and beating’ its emissions reduction targets?\n, Scott Morrison regularly claims Australia is ‘meeting and beating’ its emissions reduction targets.

We cut the cheques. We’ve done a lot. Do we need to be louder about selling that? Yeah, probably we do.”, Littleproud was also asked about comments to Guardian Australia in September that he doesn’t “know if climate change is manmade”, comments which he retracted two days later after sustained criticism., Littleproud said that “no-one is disputing” in the National party that climate change is man-made and he had professed doubt because he is “not gifted academically to have that scientific background but I’m trusting the science”., Asked if the proposed Collinsville coal power station should go ahead, he replied: “Definitely.”, “You can still invest in clean coal technology and reduce emissions,” he said., “We have to be able to achieve for every household, to be able to turn the lights on and put the air conditioner on.”, Littleproud said it was “premature” to argue the business case was not there for the power plant. He argued Australia is meeting its 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, which will only be possible due to reductions in emissions made under Labor and carryover credits for over-performance on 2020 targets., “We’re good global citizens … More than anyone we should be proud of that, rather than belting ourselves up.”new nationals deputy chastises bridget mckenzie for partisan sports grants allocation", "label": 0}, "train-131": {"text": "\nCoalition MPs clash over climate policy in first party room meeting of 2020\n, Scott Morrison faces difficult task of repositioning on climate change after assuring voters policies would ‘evolve’, \nSarah Martin, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 02.41 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 02.43 EST\n\n, The prime minister, Scott Morrison, faces a fresh internal row over climate change policy, with MPs clashing over the issue in the first Coalition party room meeting of the year., After Morrison declared at the National Press Club last week that the government needed to focus on “practical” climate change action with a focus on mitigation and resilience, MPs debated how the government should reposition its policy response., The debate followed a spill in the Nationals partyroom on Tuesday morning in which former leader Barnaby Joyce failed to topple Michael McCormack after arguing the government should do more to support coal-fired power and warning the party was at risk of losing its voice within the Coalition., In the party room meeting, Joyce also argued against “reactionary” climate policies in response to the bushfire crisis, accusing people of using the tragedy to push the “hobby horse” of climate action. He was backed by NSW National MP David Gillespie who suggested the party’s constituents did not want more action on climate policy, and it was not an issue being raised by voters., But several MPs spoke in favour of more ambitious climate action. The Liberal MP for the seat of Higgins, Katie Allen, expressed support for the “ultimate ambition of carbon neutrality” and an embrace of renewable technology to achieve that goal., Allen’s call for more action was backed by the North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman, the member for Reid, Fiona Martin, and the Goldstein MP, Tim Wilson, who all supported the embrace of new renewable technologies to cut emissions., Sources say Wilson and Zimmerman also spoke in favour of nuclear power, commending MP Ted O’Brien for his parliamentary inquiry into the issue, which was tabled in December, and advocating for it to be further explored., Zimmerman spoke about the need to do more to address voter concern in seats such as his, pointing to the loss of the Liberal-held seat of Warringah to independent Zali Steggall at the election to highlight the strength of feeling on the issue., He is understood to have argued that the Coalition was not just a coalition of parties, but a coalition of seats with divergent views on the vexed policy matter, and that these different views needed to be respected., In response, the Queensland Nationals MP George Christensen argued his colleagues were sounding like the Greens, and the government was only in power because it won seats in Queensland based on its support for the coal sector and for its support for a new coal-fired power station in the state. This claim was rejected by some MPs., But Christensen’s view was also expressed by Matt Canavan, who addressed the party room after resigning his position from cabinet, telling colleagues the party had become the party for workers., “We have become the party of workers, workers in coalmines, workers in shipyards and workers in factories,” Canavan said. “We represent those people by fighting for their jobs, and defending their jobs.”, Canavan is now calling for new coal-fired power stations to be built across the country., In an earlier meeting of just Liberal MPs, Queenslander Andrew Laming slapped down colleagues for publicly denying the science of climate change, saying it was akin to doubting “the science of the planes you fly on” coming to Canberra., He argued that while the party’s MPs should debate the policy response, it was an “impossible position” to be debating science that already underpinned the government’s emission reduction targets., The NSW senator Jim Molan was criticised for saying on ABC’s Q&amp;A program on Monday night that climate change may not be caused by humans and declaring he was “not relying on evidence” for his climate position., Conservative Craig Kelly also came under fire for telling the BBC there was no link between Australia’s bushfire crisis and climate change., Speaking after Tuesday’s meeting, Wilson argued that most MPs agreed with Morrison that the government needed to “evolve” its policies to create the jobs of the 21st century., “We are progressively going to be cutting emissions over the cycle, and that is where most MPs are, which is taking a pragmatic, sensible approach that takes the whole of the Australian community with us,” Wilson told the ABC., Addressing the party room, Morrison urged both the Nationals and Liberals to work together, saying the Coalition had a strong track record of delivering for Australians., “We come to this joint Coalition party room to do things together,” Morrison said., Morrison faces a difficult task to reposition the Coalition on climate change after assuring voters that it wanted to “evolve” its policies and do more to reduce emissions., In January the issue was also discussed in cabinet, where Morrison’s senior ministers agreed not to bolster the government’s current emissions reduction target of 26-28% of 2005 levels by 2030., Speaking in parliament on Tuesday on the government’s response to the summer bushfires, Morrison said there was a need to “heed the lessons” of a natural disaster of such magnitude., “These fires have been fuelled by one of the worst droughts on record, changing in our climate and a build-up in fuel amongst other factors,” he said., “Our summers are getting longer, drier and hotter, that’s what climate change does, and that requires a new responsiveness, resilience and a reinvigorated focus on adaptation.”coalition mps clash over climate policy in first partyroom meeting of 2020", "label": 0}, "train-132": {"text": "\nJacqui Lambie wants deal on union-busting bill 'as soon as possible'\n, Crossbencher ‘hopes to think’ she is close to a deal with government on union penalty bill unexpectedly defeated last year , \nPaul Karp, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 01.19 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 01.21 EST\n\n, Senator Jacqui Lambie is looking to strike a deal with the government “as soon as possible” on the union penalty bill, while Labor struggles to contain a debate in its own ranks about union-backed superannuation funds., Lambie is meeting the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, on Tuesday to continue negotiations on the bill, which would lower the threshold for the deregistration of unions and disqualification of their officials., In November Lambie helped Labor, the Greens and One Nation block the “ensuring integrity” bill, a shock loss for the government triggered by an about-face from One Nation following a long thaw in the minor party’s relations with Australian unions., Lambie – who had said that if militant construction unionist John Setka did not stand aside the bill would pass – nevertheless sought to amend it by proposing a review after 12 months and to exclude “a failure or refusal by the person to attend for work” from the list of breaches that could trigger deregistration., On Tuesday Lambie told Guardian Australia she would negotiate with Porter “over the next week or two” but “he’s certainly been open and approachable about it”. In November, Lambie had complained Porter had failed to consult her about amendments to pass the bill., “I’d hope to think we’re close but … after what’s happened with the sports fiasco over the last few weeks, you’d like to think they’d put a bit of integrity on themselves,” Lambie said on Tuesday., Lambie then clarified she will deal with the union bill separately, but the government’s handling of sports grant “will come further up with other things”, when it is investigated by a Senate inquiry., “I would like to get this industrial relations bill over and done with as soon as possible,” she said., “There’s bigger things to move on to … so as soon as the attorney general and I can come to an agreement that we’re happy with what we’ve got – then we’ll get it up there, we don’t want to be mucking around with it., “The attorney general has got things to move on to as well. Then everyone has stability, we all know what’s going on, and all the other unions have got stability.”, Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon, The comments are likely to spark a renewed bout of lobbying by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which has taken out ads urging Centre Alliance to join Labor and the rest of the crossbench in blocking the bill., Meanwhile, senator Tony Sheldon, the former Transport Workers Union national secretary, has written to Labor colleagues warning of “alarming consequences” if Labor backs a government bill to allow workers to opt out of superannuation funds nominated in their workplace deals., The superannuation bill implements a recommendation of the trade union royal commission that workers should “have freedom of choice of superannuation fund”., The shadow assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, has suggested Labor could support the bill and met concerned colleagues on Tuesday to discuss the issue after Sheldon raised it in caucus., Sheldon’s letter, seen by Guardian Australia, argues that the Coalition’s rhetoric of “choice” in superannuation “hides the fact that ‘choice’ often means exposing people to the bad luck of opting in to poor performing retail funds … funds that are not structured for the needs of the workers in particular industries”., Sheldon cited research by the McKell Institute showing “that where a choice of fund has been restricted in an enterprise bargaining agreement, by the workforce and their union” employees are more likely to be in high-performing funds., “The vast majority of Australians do have choice, and it is right for that presumption to continue,” he said., “However, there are important reasons why workers in some industries have voted to make a collective choice in favour of a single fund tailored for their needs – and this choice should also be recognised.”, For example, Sheldon argued transport workers benefited from the collective decision to nominate a superannuation fund with higher insurance for injury, deaths and suicide., Jones told Guardian Australia that Labor will “make a final decision on the legislation when the Senate inquiry has concluded, but what is clear is that people do want the right to choose their super fund and the law should support that”., “We are using the Senate inquiry process to ensure there are no unforeseen consequences,” he said.jacqui lambie wants deal on union busting bill as soon as possible", "label": 0}, "train-133": {"text": "Anthony Albanese says public wants 'practical' action on climate change – as it happened, Michael McCormack sees off Nationals leadership challenge from Barnaby Joyce, while Adam Bandt is elected Greens leader.

The whole argument about Kyoto carryover credits is frankly absurd. , Carryover credits were a condition the Labor party put in, in terms of the negotiations., The whole point of carryover credits is to encourage countries to take action earlier than they commit internationally. , Because it means there’s actually value and incentive to do so. Removing it an argument for governments to invest in less reduction. , It’s the most bizarre logic I think I have heard. In the end, I don’t think we need to use them. , We’ll be in a position to cut our emissions consistent with our international obligations but as I’ve said, if people want to delay and encourage countries not to take action, by scrapping carryover credits, all they’re doing is saying that for accounting purposes, they would rather countries did less., Updated\nat 1.02am EST\n, \n\n12.48am EST\n00:48\n\n, Ed Husic, who looks like he has been put into the ABC’s smaller studio (Tim Wilson is in the big one) also has some things to say about the Nationals’ actions today:, Firstly, I would like to have a chance to comment on what’s happened today. I mean, today was about commemorating, it was about respecting, it was about thanking those who fought the bushfires and all we had was this disgraceful self-indulgence from the Nationals that turned this into a farce leading into what was supposed to be a day that all sides of politics got together to talk about the very things just mentioned a few moment ago, the human story of the bushfires and we didn’t have that because of the Nationals. , Then you go into a Coalition party room where some of the Nationals want to, including Barnaby Joyce, again, defy community sentiment and the concern that is palpable and real that climate change is having an impact on people’s living environments, it’s impacting on their ability to survive in their areas, and having real life consequences, life and death consequences on people., And they still want to maintain that nothing should be done, very little should be done, on this. , And I think, people are saying, loud and clear, as they have for quite some time, one, we should be taking climate change seriously and doing what we can to reduce emissions and to play a part as a nation in tackling this issue. I just think what we saw today, as I said before, was utter disgraceful self indulgence by the Nationals., Updated\nat 1.03am EST\n, \n\n12.47am EST\n00:47\n\n, Tim Wilson is now on Afternoon Briefing on the ABC. He is asked about the Nationals hijacking today – which was meant to be about the bushfire victims:, I suspect they acknowledge it themselves. I don’t think their desire was particularly to deal with this way. But what’s been done has been done. And soon as it’s over, the focus is rightly on bushfire victims, the families, the communities affected by the awful fires over this summer period. , A number of members of parliament now are making sure they’re giving speeches, talking about the human stories, families who lost their homes, the small businesses that have lost customers, the communities that have lost much of both their physical and their emotional structures, and the need and necessity to rebuild. , And the prime minister, I think, gave a very good speech talking about how today is not the day to talk about policy, as much as possible, the focus should be on the experiences people have had, and what we need to do to make sure we rebuild as a community and a country., Updated\nat 1.03am EST\n, \n\n12.45am EST\n00:45\n\n, For those who wanted to see more of the leaders’ speeches today: , Today we gather to mourn, honour and reflect on the Black Summer that continues.

We’ll have a discussion tomorrow morning, but I would be very surprised if sports rorts don’t get a reasonable run over the next week, and indeed, months, because there has been no transparency here. , We still don’t have a list of those clubs that missed out that had high scores in favour of clubs that basically got almost zero – one club got four out of 100, and got funding, and another club who made an application got 98 and didn’t get funding.

The Greens remain essentially a Senate-based party. We’ll see how it works having their only member of the House of Representatives as the leader. , But I don’t see that it will make an enormous difference. From time to time, Adam Bandt’s rhetoric is more extreme than Richard Di Natale’s rhetoric was, but we’ll wait and see how that plays out. , The truth is that I’m running for Prime Minister against Scott Morrison, not against the Greens or Clive Palmer or One Nation or anyone else., \n\n12.24am EST\n00:24\n\n, For those desperate to see them., Anyone care for some leaked PMO talking points? pic.twitter.com/8TetRvG9qQ, But honestly – you do see them.

What they want is action that is practical, that makes a difference, that reduces emissions – that’s what my framework is. , They want to see emissions going down, because they understand that also Australia can’t do it by ourselves. Australians want our nation to speak up strongly in international forums – we’re not doing that at the moment.

Certainly the Prime Minister didn’t have the courtesy of consulting Labor about the appointment of Mark Binskin. , He is obviously a very distinguished person, but I would have thought that on an issue like this, the opposition should have been at least consulted. Certainly there is a range of inquiries, there is the official ones from New South Wales and Victoria, but of course the loss of life means that there will be coronial inquiries as well, and we have a range of other reports and inquiries that have been held in the past. , What we need to do is to make sure that the starting point is looking at what the recommendations have been, looking forward in terms of what – what issues might need to be taken up, taken further, and the opposition also hasn’t been consulted on the terms of reference.

Services Australia has frozen debts on payment plans as it reviews them., Last year Services Australia said as of June it had banked $1.9bn in recouped overpayments, with about $700m that had already been paid back by welfare recipients. Nearly 700,000 debts had been issued at an average of about $2,ooo each., Under Australian class action law, the court will define a “class” of people who are eligible to be involved. All people who meet the definition will be considered part of the class action unless they opt out., The government is expected to file a reply to the class action in the coming weeks ahead of case management hearing next month.almost 10000 people register as robodebt class action gains momentum", "label": 0}, "train-135": {"text": "\nGrandmother of children killed by alleged drink-driver in Sydney says pain 'too much to handle'\n, ‘Pray for us’: Georgette Abdallah thanks supporters as she visits site of the crash in Sydney’s Oatlands, Australian Associated Press, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 00.10 EST\n\n, The grandmother of the children killed by an alleged drink-driver as they were going to get ice cream in Sydney’s west says the pain of the tragedy is “too much to handle”., Abdallah siblings Sienna, 8, Angelina, 12, and Antony, 13, died at the scene in Oatlands on Saturday night alongside their 11-year-old cousin Veronique Sakr., Grandmother Georgette Abdallah on Tuesday visited the site and thanked the hundreds of people who have supported the family., “Thank you everyone for supporting us,” she told reporters., “Please pray for us.

So when the 69-year-old did not report in on the morning after the Cudlee Creek bushfire, his family was concerned but did not immediately fear the worst., “When my sister called me to say that they’d found a body I just couldn’t believe it. It just didn’t seem real,” says daughter Johanna Selth. “I was here in the US in Washington DC and was just like: ‘It can’t be him. There must have been someone else up there, because he knows what he’s doing and he wouldn’t have got caught like that.’ ”, The fire, which started on a day of catastrophic fire danger in the Mount Lofty Ranges on 20 December, destroyed 60 homes and 23,000ha of forest and farms before it was contained 11 days later., The point of origin was reported to be a branch falling on to a power line, and it sparked in a heatwave two days after Australia’s hottest day on record, in the hottest year on record, in a landscape where the bushfire risk had been elevated because of drought., These were the kind of deadly fire conditions that scientists have repeatedly warned would become more common in a heating climate. And Selth’s family say that unless there is urgent action many more families could lose a loved one to bushfire., Johanna says the response from the Australian government so far has been “pretty disappointing and really upsetting”., “If something good could come out of this, if something could change out of this in terms of the action that’s being taken on climate change, that would be a positive outcome out of the devastating negative outcomes that we’ve just lived through,” she says., With siblings Luke Selth and Jasmine Berry, she has called on the government to take stronger action to reduce emissions., “Due to climate change, these sorts of events will become more and more common, and it’s likely more and more people will experience the sort of tragedy we have been through,” says Luke Selth, a senior research fellow at Adelaide medical school., Ron Selth and his family bought the 1950s farmhouse and 113ha sheep property at Charleston in January 1983, just weeks before the deadly Ash Wednesday fires. It had been threatened by fire before, and like most who live on the land in south-eastern Australia, Selth knew how to prepare the property and had spent time at the end of a fire hose., Selth lived for most of the week with his partner Suzy in Crafers, a small town in the Mount Lofty ranges about 20 minutes’ drive from Adelaide and 30 minutes from the farm. He had built up an engineering company over more than 35 years, and worked on “thousands and thousands” of homes in the Adelaide Hills., He stayed at the farm once a week to care for his 160 sheep, about 50 of which were killed or had to be euthanised after the fire., But when his grandchildren visited he would be roped into building boys v girls treehouses and taking them boating on the dam., “The three of us siblings all now live in cities, but my brother and sister used to take their kids up to the farm really regularly and whenever my kids are in Adelaide all they want to do is go back to the farm and spend time with grandpa,” Johanna says., When Ron Selth returned to his Charleston home on the day the fire began, the region was under a watch and act alert, which meant there was an active fire nearby but they were not considered to be under direct threat. That changed in the evening. Selth’s neighbours, who also stayed to defend their property, filmed a “firestorm” roaring through soon after dark., Selth had a plan to get to a safer place but was found at the house on an area of well-watered ground. His family are waiting for a coroner’s report to confirm suspicions that he collapsed before the fire arrived., On the Saturday after the fire, a 40C day after Christmas, Johanna, Luke and Jasmine drove to the farm to find some trees still burning and their childhood home reduced to rubble. Only two pot-bellied stoves were left standing., “It was devastating really to see that it had all gone,” Johanna says. “We didn’t take up our kids because they would have been too upset ... The whole thing was gone. Even most of the brick walls had come down so the fire was obviously extremely intense. There was almost nothing left.”, The rose bushes planted by their mother, who died of leukaemia 18 years ago, were also gone, as were the fruit trees. But across a narrow driveway, one of the sheds was untouched., “It didn’t even have any scorch marks,” Johanna says. “It looked like the fire hadn’t made it across that thin stretch of gravel driveway., “The one thing we didn’t care about was fine and everything else was gone.”after the bushfire a father lost a home destroyed and a plea for the future", "label": 0}, "train-137": {"text": "\nNicola Gobbo grilled under oath about how she became Lawyer X\n, Barrister-turned-informer gives evidence to royal commission by videolink from an undisclosed location due to safety concerns, Australian Associated Press, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 22.26 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 23.00 EST\n\n, Lawyer X Nicola Gobbo has told an inquiry into her informing that she always knew it would end up in a royal commission, but she was not certain she would be alive to see it., Gobbo also said she was once fascinated by the relationship between police and informers, something she has now said was “laughable in a horrendous way”., The gangland lawyer-turned-police informer was being grilled under oath on Tuesday about her three stints of informing, though she claims she didn’t know she was registered at least once until it came out publicly last year., Gobbo claimed Victoria police became too relaxed using her as an informer, treating it “like a joke”., The supergrass lawyer was first registered as an informer in 1995 when she was a student and dobbed on her boyfriend for drug trafficking., “I wasn’t aware that I was registered by them until it came out in the media,” Gobbo said., She was no stranger to police use of informers. The relationship between officers and their sources was so interesting to her she started researching it as a Masters degree topic., “Looking back on where we are now, it’s laughable in a horrendous way,” she told the hearing by videolink., Despite giving a television interview in December, the commissioner, Margaret McMurdo, ordered on Monday that Gobbo’s face not be shown publicly for safety reasons., Her second registration as an informer came in 1999 when she was introduced by the corrupt former drug squad detective Wayne Strawhorn to Jeff Pope, a detective who went on to become an assistant commissioner., Gobbo described competing feelings for Strawhorn, who was convicted in 2006 of selling 2kg pseudoephedrine to underworld figure Mark Moran, before Moran’s 2000 murder., “Part of me was petrified of the man because of the power I, at least, perceived that he had and the control he had over the drug squad,” she said., The other part of her respected him because when he offered her clients the “deal of a lifetime”, he delivered., Gobbo was recruited that time after claiming a legal colleague was laundering money. She had first gone to the Australian federal police and National Crime Authority with the allegations., She admitted a “drunken interlude” and intimate Friday night relationships with an AFP officer who was investigating, but the relationship ended after it became clear federal police weren’t interested in her information., Gobbo later went on to inform from 2005 to 2009, sharing information with police about clients including drug kingpin Tony Mokbel and underworld killer Carl Williams., Gobbo took the oath on Tuesday morning, swearing to tell the whole truth., The counsel assisting, Chris Winneke QC, began his grilling by challenging Gobbo’s previous evidence under oath relating to her 1997 Victorian Legal Admissions Board application to become a lawyer., Gobbo admitted that document, outlining previous drug convictions, was “misleading”., She also claimed in a letter to the board that she would endeavour to be an upstanding member of the legal profession., “Obviously, I have failed in that regard, because look where we are,” she said., The hearing continues.nicola gobbo grilled under oath about how she became lawyer x", "label": 0}, "train-138": {"text": "Only three private health funds will be viable in two years, Australian regulator warns, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority may force underperforming funds to merge in industry ‘death spiral’, Only three private health funds will be financially viable within two years if the industry does not take urgent action to break out of its “death spiral”, the prudential regulator says., In what he described as a “blunt message” to the troubled industry, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority member Geoff Summerhayes warned the regulator might force underperforming funds to merge if they did not control their costs or arrange their own merger., Summerhayes said payouts from funds were continuing to soar as the price of medical treatments rose and younger people fled private health insurance, leaving the system stuffed with older members who tended to make bigger claims., He said the industry responded by reducing benefits to policyholders, “which may explain why efforts to suppress premium growth haven’t stemmed declining levels of coverage”., In a speech to a meeting of not-for-profit funds in Sydney on Tuesday morning, Summerhayes again warned the industry against “complacently waiting for the government to rescue them”., However, he said Apra would support an independent review of private health insurance that would re-examine whether one of its core principles, community rating, was still viable., Under community rating, health insurers are required to offer their products at the same price to everybody, regardless of their age or existing illness and injury., Summerhayes said Apra recognised that ending community rating had “potential downsides”., “For example, scrapping or recalibrating the community rating model to lower premiums for younger, healthier policyholders would inevitably push up premiums for older, sicker members,” he said., Summerhayes’ intervention is likely to reignite a political battle over the future of private health insurance, which is heavily subsidised by taxpayers due to a 30% tax rebate on premiums that costs the government more than $6bn a year., The rebate cost the budget about $6.4bn in 2018-19 and is predicted to top $7.1bn by 2022-23, budget papers show., Despite the hefty rebate, membership of funds continues to fall, with the proportion of Australians with hospital cover dropping from 47.4% in 2015 to 44.1% in September., Summerhayes said there were “no easy answers” to the industry’s woes., “What we do have a firm position on is that the industry’s current trajectory is unsustainable; and that while private health insurers may be the ultimate victims of the so-called death spiral, policyholders will be the first casualties through higher premiums and reduced benefits.”, Apra forecasts that private health cover will continue to shrink, with most of the losses coming from people between 20 and 34., There are currently 37 health insurers but Apra forecasts that, if benefit costs continue to increase by 5% a year and premiums by 3% a year, by March 2022 only three big for-profit funds will have businesses that are sustainable and well-capitalised., The remainder of the industry might not be sustainable, and four funds were in more immediate danger because they were both unsustainable and lacked adequate capital., “When not even substantial taxpayer subsidies and the Medicare levy surcharge can convince a growing number of policyholders that private health insurance represents value for money, it’s time for a rethink,” Summerhayes said., “For now, PHIs private health insurers are profitable, well capitalised and comfortably able to meet their obligations to policyholders, but that will not remain the case much longer without major structural and policy reforms,” he said., “We should not wait for the industry’s stable but serious condition to become critical before operating to save it.”, Summerhayes also said that Apra would soon have more to say on the impact of global heating on the banks, insurers and super funds it regulated., He has previously warned that directors may be in breach of their legal duties if they fail to consider climate risk.only three private health funds will be viable in two years australian regulator warns", "label": 0}, "train-139": {"text": "\nMichael McCormack defeats Barnaby Joyce in National party leadership spill – video\n, Nationals leader Michael McCormack has survived a challenge from former party leader Barnaby Joyce, with David Littleproud elected the new deputy leader.

For the time being. But Barnaby Joyce is nothing if not an opportunist. Like a rat up a drainpipe, he will watch for the next opening., And if the rumoured close numbers are correct, that won’t take long. Joyce will be back and he has nuanced his messaging for the new political climate., “It is a tough game at the moment; we are being attacked on all sides, whether it’s Shooters and Fishers, One Nation, whether it’s independents, we have to speak with our own voice in an honest and forthright way because that is actually how we will keep a Coalition government,” Joyce said this week., And he is right on that point, even if he is so wrong for any leadership position in very many ways., But if the sports rorts saga has raised any one single question, it is: what is the actual point of the National party these days?, Don’t get me wrong. I absolutely see a need for a strong country party. But the National party is not doing the job that a country party needs to do., Rural Australia is experiencing unprecedented conditions including drought and bushfires. Communities and landscapes are running out of water. There are changing global trade conditions challenging those of us in export industries, what with Brexit, the spreading coronavirus and the US-China trade stand off., Rural people are feeling under siege. In some cases they are scared. They need to know rural leaders have their back. They need to know their leaders will be steady and trustworthy., There are farmers and townspeople who have lost everything to the bushfires. There are small towns where they have lost half the houses. Meanwhile Barnaby Joyce is focused on getting his old job back., As one farmer texted on Monday, “farmers going broke in drought and burning and the idiots are having a chest-pumping competition”., This whole leadership spill was kicked off by the so-called #sportsrorts story, the arc of which is familiar by now., There was clear evidence of a Nationals minister funding less-deserving cases (according to Sport Australia) in marginal Liberal and Labor seats, while doing some of the National party’s most merit-worthy and loyal voters in the eye., After the ballot, McCormack said he did not expect Joyce to challenge again and kept repeating – like a mantra – “we will move on and work hard together”., But the instability will continue. And now McCormack has another putative leader as deputy, David Littleproud., McKenzie was not a leadership threat because she is a senator and could not have visibility as a leader from that house. McCormack has worked hard to keep Littleproud at arm’s length., So with Joyce on one side and Littleproud on the other, McCormack’s job is not going to get any easier. But what is that job exactly?, Rural electorates are tinder dry, as dry as the parched paddocks that their voters deal with. As dry as the Australian landscapes that have burned since winter., As Joyce said, the party’s threats include largely state-based parties on the right but also the outbreak of more centrist independents who are agitating for action on the climate crisis., They are making inroads into safe electorates, pushing voters not accustomed to having wide electoral competitions to make a choice., The big take-home lesson from the sports rorts was that these sporting clubs failed to get funding because they were too safe. Nationals have told their voters in no uncertain terms to make them marginal., There are fundamental policy challenges ahead for rural Australia, yet the National party has no answers and has done no work., Their climate change policy is non-existent as farmers increasingly deal with drought, bushfires and floods., Most of their electorates are significant producers of food, yet there is no coherent policy on food production, just plenty of talk about coal., As he resigned from cabinet this week to back Joyce, the former resources minister Matt Canavan said that regional Australians had “struggled to get our voice heard” and the Nationals needed to stop “city-based commentators” dominating debates affecting regional constituents, such as the future of coal., Remember last year, under questioning from The Project’s Waleed Aly, McCormack could not think of a single time he backed farmers over miners., This party is about coal. Not food production., Then there is the personality club. Since the rise of Joyce, the party has splintered and factionalised. Joyce has used those factions to his advantage. His challenge was about fulfilling his own ambition. There is no show without Barnaby., As he said before the ballot: “What I will look for is the future with the party. Two years out from an election and two years from the previous change and before we go back to parliament, if there is a time for consideration, this is it.”, So here is yet another fork in the road – a chance to consider what we want out of our rural representation., The lesson for rural Australia and for the National party is this: the crossbench has proved the power of independent influence, mustering the major parties by using tight numbers. Cathy McGowan designed legislation for a national integrity commission. Kerryn Phelps designed legislation for medical evacuations from Manus. Power comes from standing apart., With the deep polarisation in the electorate, tight election wins are not disappearing any time soon. An independent party is a powerful party. Joyce has signalled that influence lies in greater separatism from the Liberals, even if his direction is all about his own ambition., Rural Australia should at least take that on board. This leadership spill has shown that you have influence. Use it.barnaby joyce is right the nationals should speak up but not to serve his ambition", "label": 0}, "train-141": {"text": "\nAdam Bandt pledges to push for Australian Green New Deal after being elected Greens leader\n, MP vows to provide ‘real opposition’ to Morrison government as senators Larissa Waters and Nick McKim elected co-deputy leaders of the party, \nPaul Karp, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 19.54 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 3 Feb 2020 18.50 EST\n\n, Adam Bandt has been elected Greens leader unopposed, with Larissa Waters and Nick McKim to serve as co-deputy leaders., The Greens party whip Rachel Siewert delivered the result of the Greens’ party room meeting on Tuesday, settling the leadership question created when Richard Di Natale announced his resignation on Monday. Waters was also elected Senate leader and McKim will become deputy Senate leader., Bandt immediately announced the Greens would campaign on a platform of a Green New Deal, rebranding policies to include dental care in Medicare, make education free by abolishing public school fees, and to phase out fossil fuel extraction in favour of an advanced mining and manufacturing sector powered by renewable energy., Bandt told reporters in Canberra he aimed to win the balance of power in both the House of Representatives and Senate at the next election, promising to build campaign pressure on the Morrison government to take action on climate change in the meantime but ultimately to turf them out of office., Bandt cited the Greens’ agreement with the Gillard Labor government in 2010 as a model, saying “the only time that pollution has been cut in this country is when the Greens shared power with Labor and independents”., He also noted the Greens’ Shane Rattenbury holds the climate portfolio in the Australian Capital Territory government and Jacinda Ardern governs with the Greens in New Zealand., In an escalation of rhetoric, Bandt said he would remind Australia that the planet is on track for 3C of heating, blaming the Coalition government, which he labelled “criminal” for abolition of the carbon price under Tony Abbott., Bandt said that given catastrophic bushfires had occurred at 1C of heating, that the Coalition’s path to 3C would lead to “three times as much pain, three times as much suffering and three times as many deaths”. He also warned big businesses that are “killing people” by contributing to “climate catastrophe” that they should be worried., Bandt suggested the Greens would provide “real opposition” to the Morrison government., He argued that although the Liberal and Labor parties are not “the same”, they are “singing from the same song sheet” about the need for Australia to maintain a coalmining industry, and also criticised Labor’s decision to pass income tax cuts that benefited high-income earners., Bandt, a former industrial lawyer with close links to unions, was elected to the lower house in 2010. He was the first and still only Greens member of the House of Representatives, elected to the seat of Melbourne after the retirement of Labor’s Lindsay Tanner., Anthony Albanese told ABC TV he didn’t think the change of Greens leader would “make an enormous difference” to Labor because he was running against Scott Morrison and the Coalition, not the Greens., “The Greens remain essentially a Senate-based party,” he said. “We’ll see how it works having their only member of the House of Representatives as the leader.”, Albanese noted that “from time to time Adam Bandt’s rhetoric is more extreme than Richard Di Natale’s”. , “I don’t think that you advance your cause, your objective, by coming up with strong rhetoric that has people who agree with you agreeing with you even stronger.”, In a statement, Bandt thanked Di Natale “for his leadership of our party and service to our country” and his colleagues “for their support and the confidence they have placed in me”.

He pointed at the final lines of the report, which said the analysis “by no means provides conclusive evidence that deliberate bias exists.”, The report’s author, Dr Geoffrey Barnes, told Guardian Australia that comment, which preceded a call for more research, was a standard caveat on all scientific research., Dawson told 6PR the report “does cast doubt and we are continuing to work around it.” He confirmed that the evidence-based policing unit, which produced the report, had been greatly reduced., “I’ve pared it right back … I have other priorities,” he said. “I’m not saying it had no utility but I think it was over-emphasised for a moment in time.”, Nerita Waight, co-chair of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service, said the “over-policing and profiling of Aboriginal people in Western Australia has been an ongoing problem for community.”, “Unfortunately, the inappropriate use of police discretion in these situations is not just a Western Australian problem, it is a problem across the entire country,” she said., “Because police have broad discretionary powers they act as the gatekeepers on who enters the criminal legal system and how …, “Being imprisoned, even if it’s for a short amount of time, puts the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at risk of being drawn into the quicksand of the criminal legal system, which can be deadly for them.”, The McGowan government last year introduced legislation to abolish the practice of jailing people for unpaid fines. That practice only applied to court fines, not traffic infringements, unless the infringement was dealt with before the court., The legislation, which is yet to pass parliament, would also allow authorities to garnish the salary of a person who has unpaid fines until the debt is cleared., It was prompted by the 2014 death in custody of the Yamatji woman Ms Dhu., Monique Hurley, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said racially motivated over-policing could cause “enormous harm”., “This data shows clearly that WA police have a serious racism problem,” Hurley said. “For WA police and the WA government to just sit on their hands in the face of this stark injustice is inexcusable.

The records also list its principal place of business as Briggs’ family home in Sydney’s Sutherland Shire., Removing donations from a party’s annual return takes some time. No change had yet been made at 9am Thursday. , Evidence that it was originally declared by the Liberal party before being later deleted will remain on the Australian electoral commission’s website permanently. , The plan to privatise Australia’s visa processing system has been met with significant criticism. It has prompted fears that thousands of jobs will be lost and sensitive private information will be compromised., The main public service union, the Community and Public Sector Union, has warned it will give private companies too much of a say over who is allowed to come to Australia., Briggs’ consortium Australian Visa Processing Pty Ltd is one of two key players vying for the visa privatisation contract., Any suggestion of a conflict has been hotly disputed by Coalition ministers, who say Morrison has no role in deciding the tender. Morrison and Coleman have reportedly removed themselves from any cabinet and expenditure review committee discussions about the contract., Similar privatisation in the United Kingdom has led to exorbitant costs and extensive delays for migrants seeking visas., Freedom of information documents released last year showed that legislative change would be needed to privatise the visa system. That could delay the government’s plans considerably, because Labor and key crossbenchers have indicated their opposition., On Tuesday, Giles issued a statement criticising the Liberal party’s acceptance of donations from Pacific Blue Capital., “This is a terrible look – trust in the political system is already at an all-time low,” Giles said. “The last thing Australia needs is our visa system being sold off to the highest bidder.”, The department of home affairs says it would retain control of visa decisions under the new system. It says it has already spent more than $80m on the system’s design and procurement., Western Sydney University academics Marina Khan and Shanthi Robertson wrote in December that the privatisation would create significant risks., “Home Affairs claims privatisation will improve efficiency and reduce costs,” they wrote for The Conversation. “But it also comes with major risks, some we’ve seen already play out in the privatisation of immigration control through commercialised immigration detention, such as on Christmas Island.”, “These risks include corruption, consumer protection issues and damage to the overall integrity of the visa system.”liberal party refuses questions over 165k donation by morrison ally bidding for 1bn visa privatisation contract", "label": 0}, "train-147": {"text": "\nCashless welfare card: how does it work and what changes is the government proposing?\n, The Coalition reboots calls for a national expansion as it seeks to extend the scheme across the Northern Territory, \nLuke Henriques-Gomes, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 11.59 EST\n\n, As the Morrison government seeks support to expand the cashless debit card to the Northern Territory, it has also rebooted calls for a national expansion of the card., While the government has previously focused on the card as a policy to reduce what it calls “welfare-fuelled alcohol, gambling and drug misuse”, now it is also arguing that it is a “broad financial and budgeting tool”., Those benefits are fiercely contested by welfare groups and Indigenous organisations, which say the card is discriminatory and not backed by adequate evidence., The card is operated by Indue and is currently being trialled in Ceduna in South Australia, East Kimberley in Western Australia, the Goldfields in WA and Hervey Bay in Queensland., It quarantines 80% of a person’s income support payments. The money on the card cannot be used to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines or Eftpos terminals, or to buy alcohol, tobacco or gambling products. The rest is paid into their bank account as cash., For example, Bundaberg resident Jodie McNally, 33, is on Newstart and is unable to work full-time due to a range of chronic illnesses. She told Guardian Australia she receives $532 a fortnight on the card and $133 that she can access in cash., “It’s been absolutely terrible from the very start,” she said., The Morrison government is currently trying to pass its planned expansion of the cashless debit card to the NT. Welfare recipients in the NT are already on the far-more restrictive Basics card, which was introduced under the Intervention 12 years ago and quarantines 50% of their income. This split will stay in place for NT cardholders., At the same time, the social services minister, Anne Ruston, is spruiking what she says are the card’s benefits as part of what the government hopes might one day be a national rollout. “This card, because of technology, is now able to provide a broad financial and budgeting tool assistance to people,” she said recently., The government has commissioned an independent report after an earlier study that found positive impacts was heavily criticised by an audit. It is yet to release the latest report., Obviously you can’t use the card in the cash economy – that is anywhere where there are no Eftpos machines. Examples often cited by critics include garage sales, fetes and roadside market stalls where cardholders say they could previously buy fruit and vegetables at cheaper prices., The Australian Council of Social Service chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said the card made it “harder for people to buy from op-shops, buy second-hand furniture, rent in shared accommodation or to provide children with money for school activities”., McNally said the card had caused her issues renting in emergency accommodation and inhibited her ability to buy second-hand goods. For example, she said she had to borrow cash from a relative to buy parts to fix her car from a wrecker that only accepted cash. “What kind of a drug, or gambling or alcohol is that,” she said., Some online retailers and eBay are also banned. To purchase second-hand products from Facebook Marketplace, McNally said she was required to take a screenshot of the advertisement in question and make an application to Indue., “Then you take these forms to Indue and say, “Can I please buy this item? It can be four days until they decide whether you can buy it or not,” said McNally, who joined a protest against the card in Canberra this week., In general, Indue currently blocks merchants rather than products. It provides a list of banned merchants, most of which are pubs and bars in the trial areas. The government says it is automatically accepted at about 900,000 businesses across the country. It notes that the card is also available at major retailers where alcohol is sold, such as Woolworths, Coles and Australia Post., But cardholders have complained about having their cards declined at retailers that do not primarily sell these banned goods. One woman told of her humiliation of being denied at Just Jeans., A Senate inquiry has heard claims that one mother who could not buy a children’s book from a bookstore was told her card was blocked because the shop also sold books on distilling alcohol., In another alleged case, a nursing student on placement was unable to buy a stethoscope and university books from the Medshop. The submission claimed that Indue staff said she could not buy those things as she may be trying to buy hand sanitisers to drink., The government has established a working group that includes the big four banks and some other financial institutions to make this happen. Coles and Woolworths have also provided advice to the government., Asked by Guardian Australia about their work on the card, the big banks, Woolworths and Coles said they were only providing advice upon request from the government. None would say they supported the card. They are not being paid for their advice, they said., The banks have been asked to provide technical advice on product-level blocking, meaning that items such as alcohol, gambling and cash withdrawals could be blocked when a transaction was made. In cases where a prohibited product is not sought, the card would work like any other, and could be used anywhere that Eftpos is available. While this already occurs at some major retailers, the aim is to extend this to small businesses., Goldie said if they signed up to the “politicised and unproven cashless debit card it would do little to restore public confidence in the major banks”., “The banks need to rule out working with the government on this stigmatising, impractical scheme, which would be a colossal waste of public funds,” she said.cashless welfare card how does it work and what changes is the government proposing", "label": 0}, "train-148": {"text": "\nI feel sick thinking about being forced on to cashless welfare.

It becomes a kind of compulsion when you are reliant on Centrelink payments to survive; scanning the headlines to see what other monstrosity they will foist upon you is necessary, and also incredibly dejecting., Finding out about the current government’s push to put all welfare recipients on the cashless welfare card made my stomach drop. I felt physically sick every time I thought of it, and still do. For a few days, I had to stop scanning the headlines., For those who don’t know, the cashless welfare card is a card that is issued to welfare recipients where 80% of your money is locked onto the card. Only 20% can be accessed for cash. The original form was the Basics card, pushed onto remote Aboriginal communities during the Intervention and framed as a solution to social problems. Andrew “Twiggy” Forest came up with this newer, flashier version with all his non-existent expertise in social work. I know nothing about mining. I guess this means Twiggy would welcome my non-existent expertise in his billion-dollar business. Don’t worry Twiggy, my suggestions on how you can stop wasting money are on their way to you posthaste. Oh, you don’t want my instructions on how to spend your money? Yeah. I don’t want yours either., It is frequently touted by certain MPs as “just like an Eftpos card, except you can’t buy alcohol or gambling products”. I cannot tell you how many times I have felt enraged reading this absolute falsehood. Having watched the progression of the cashless welfare card in Australia and listening to people who are on it, nothing could be further from the truth., Eftpos cards don’t stop you buying goods online. Eftpos cards don’t stop you buying things second hand. Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree, garage sales: these are all off limits to someone on a card. For someone like me on Newstart (now called Jobseeker’s allowance), this can be an absolute disaster if I don’t have access to ready cash. If my fridge breaks down, I can buy one second hand for $50 online. From a big appliance store, it can cost $400. Using large amounts of money requires the approval of Indue, the faceless corporation making $10,000 a year per person for administering my money. Please wait kind stranger, hold onto that fridge, while I go begging Daddy Indue for permission to use my funds., Eftpos cards don’t make me feel like Oliver Twist., I am struggling to describe the anger I feel when forced to contemplate a future on a cashless welfare card. Anne Ruston in her latest interview claimed it was a “financial literacy tool”. Excuse my language, but what a bloody insult to me and every other person relying on Centrelink payments. We are not poor because we have trouble managing money. We are poor because payments are so low on Centrelink it requires financial gymnastics to survive. We don’t magically lose financial literacy just because we are on payments. How stupid do you think we are? It is the highest insult to tell the poor they could just stop being poor by budgeting., Living on Centrelink payments forces me to budget incredibly carefully, and I am damn good at it. It is an intricate ballet of moving money around like dancers on a dance floor, ensuring they don’t crash into each other. I have a mental tally of which bill is due when and I move my money accordingly. I use a prepaid mobile. I buy secondhand goods. I dumpster dive. I use charities when necessary for food., Do you know what doesn’t help? Having restrictions on my money. Being told where to spend my pittance of an income is just cruel. Having had relatives go through domestic violence, I am aware of the financial control exerted on them in violent relationships. Being denied agency and control over your own funds wears away at you, to the point where you start believing you can’t do anything. It is not a way to encourage financial literacy. It is financial abuse. So why is it now a government policy?, If you have never been on Centrelink payments it is very difficult to describe the lack of power and control you feel when you see announcements like these. Imagine that your only form of income is at the whim and mercy of a few men and women in a room, whose daily accommodation budget for Canberra is more than what you get in a week. You are told you are incapable of managing your funds lest you waste it on booze or drugs or gambling. Never mind that you actually don’t have these issues.

You can only conclude the government wanted this inquiry over. It had created embarrassment for them and this is their cynical response.”, The government’s special minister of state, Don Harwin, disputed that conclusion. A spokesman said the LECC was an independent statutory office and the administration of public hearings was “entirely a matter for the acting commissioner”, Reginald Blanch QC., “It is not possible or appropriate for the government to instruct or direct the LECC in relation to the exercise of its functions,” he said., But Adams, a QC and former NSW supreme court judge who drove the establishment of the strip search inquiry, had a reputation for forthrightness that had seen him have numerous run-ins with the government and law enforcement figures., Less than a fortnight before his removal he drew the ire of the NSW Police Association after he told a parliamentary inquiry there was “significant corruption” within the ranks of NSW police, saying “otherwise, for example, bikie gangs could not be the major manufacturers of methamphetamine in NSW”., Following his removal in December, a report in The Australian said the government had not renewed Adams’ contract after a confidential inquiry found the agency was “dysfunctional” and raised concerns about leadership at the highest levels., On Wednesday that report was released publicly for the first time. It revealed that while a number of complaints had been made about Adams by another LECC commissioner, Patrick Saidi, none of them had been upheld., Instead, that inquiry considered whether Saidi himself may have engaged in “maladministration or misconduct”, but did not make a finding. Guardian Australia understands Saidi was removed from the LECC in January, shortly after Adams., Held in October and December, the public hearings revealed a disturbing pattern of police misusing strip search powers on minors, as well as evidence that many police do not understand the laws governing strip searches., In one case a 16-year-old girl was fearful and in tears after she was forced to strip naked and squat in front of a police officer who then “looked underneath” her at the Splendour in the Grass festival in 2018., In another, a 15-year-old boy said he “shook with nerves” after a police officer told him to “hold your dick and lift your balls up and show me your gooch” during a search at an under-18s music festival in February last year.strip search inquiry cut short after nsw government sacks commissioner", "label": 0}, "train-150": {"text": "\nMorrison staffer who helped club win grant caught on video urging crowd to vote Liberal\n, Online video emerges as the Senate sets up an inquiry into the Coalition’s $100m sports rort grants, \nPaul Karp, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 03.45 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 18.13 EST\n\n, Video has emerged online of a member of Scott Morrison’s electorate staff being lauded for helping Cronulla Sailing Club win an $8,400 grant, as the Senate moved on Wednesday to set up an inquiry into the controversial $100m community sport infrastructure grant program., In the video posted to Facebook, a representative of the club thanks the staffer, identifying her as “Scott Morrison’s PA”, for helping push her to apply for a grant for a new stainless steel barbecue. GrantConnect shows the grant was approved in December 2017 as part of the stronger communities program., The Morrison staffer thanks the club, crediting the fact “your application was extremely well written” for the grant. She urged the crowd “it’s not me who gives you the money, it’s ScoMo Scott Morrison – so vote Liberal come May … Because if you don’t I don’t have a job.”, The stronger communities program grants every electorate a fund of $150,000, allocated by the infrastructure department on the advice of a committee including the local MP to pay for small community projects, funding everything from BBQs to iPads and lawnmowers., A spokesman for Morrison said: “The only support the member for Cook Morrison and his office have offered applicants is technical advice to ensure their applications comply with the eligibility requirements., “The staff member regrets her comment and apologises but all our ministers, members, senators and staff are proud of how a programme our government initiated has supported local communities across every Liberal, Labor, National, Greens and independent electorate,” he said., “All applications are appropriately independently assessed by the department taking account of actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest and they come forward based on the recommendations from community leaders.”, The constitutional expert Anne Twomey has warned that both the stronger communities program and sports grants program could be unconstitutional because the commonwealth lacks a head of power to make grants for those purposes., On Wednesday Labor and the Greens successfully established a select Senate committee to inquire into the community sport infrastructure program, subject of a scathing auditor general’s report finding Bridget McKenzie had targeted projects at marginal seats., The government had attempted to draw a line under the saga when McKenzie resigned from cabinet and as the deputy Nationals leader on Sunday. The new deputy Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has conceded the partisan allocation of projects by party representation in marginal seats is not “the best way to do it”., On Wednesday the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, claimed Littleproud had been “misrepresented” and argued that both the projects awarded funding due to McKenzie’s intervention – and those recommended by Sport Australia with a higher score – were “all worthy projects”., The terms of the inquiry include “the role of the offices of the minister, the prime minister and deputy prime minister, and any external parties, in determining which grants would be awarded and who would announce the successful grants”., Morrison has claimed his office’s role was limited to relaying representations from MPs to the sport minister about potential projects, but Labor is keen to probe reports staff in the prime minister’s office asked for adjustments of which received funding., Labor also intends to call Phil Gaetjens, the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who found McKenzie had breached ministerial guidelines by failing to declare a membership to the Wangaratta Clay Target Club, which she then gave a $36,000 grant., Morrison has selectively quoted the report written by his former chief of staff to suggest McKenzie was cleared of other wrongdoing, but refused to release it, and likewise has not released advice from the attorney general Christian Porter that McKenzie had authority to give grants., On Wednesday the Senate also passed an order to produce the Gaetjens report and emails from the prime minister’s office to McKenzie about the grant program., The Greens senator, Larissa Waters, who moved the motion, said the “community deserves to know what really went on”., The shadow public services minister, Katy Gallagher, told the Senate that the Gaetjens report’s conclusion that he “did not find evidence that this process was unduly influenced by reference to marginal or targeted electorates” was the “completely opposite” view to the one taken by the auditor general., She said Morrison had either misled the public about the Gaetjens report or that Gaetjens had engaged in a “whitewash” to protect the prime minister from scrutiny., Earlier, the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the lower house that Morrison was attempting “not to clean up but to cover up” the handling of the program “with a secret report from a former Liberal party staffer”., Before question time, Labor members delivered a series of speeches accusing the government of having “cheated” more deserving clubs., The shadow youth minister, Amanda Rishworth, raised the example of South Adelaide Football Club, which she said had “more women’s premierships than changerooms” but missed out on grant funding., She noted the Old Collegian rugby club in the marginal seat of Sturt was given funding for women’s changerooms despite not having fielded a women’s team since 2018., Asked in question time if the government had funded the projects with the most merit, Morrison replied: “I believe funding community sports infrastructure always has merit.”, Morrison claimed the auditor general had concluded that McKenzie “had the authority to make those decisions”., In fact, the Australian National Audit Office report said it is “not evident to the Anao what the legal authority was” for McKenzie to approve grants. It noted that although the sport minister has a power to direct Sport Australia “it was not used”., Morrison again left the door open to fund unsuccessful clubs, noting that sports clubs had proposed a total of $400m of projects and the government had funded $100m., “As I said last week, we think this infrastructure is important to local communities,” he said. “I’ll be working with the treasurer as we prepare for this year’s budget to see how we can provide further support for this important infrastructure that brings communities together.”, At the adjournment of the Senate, McKenzie made a short statement declaring in her opinion her memberships did not cause any “real or apparent” conflict of interest, but apologising for the failure to disclose them to the Senate. She announced she is no longer a member of the Wangaratta Clay Target Club.morrison staffer who helped club win grant caught on video urging crowd to vote liberal", "label": 0}, "train-151": {"text": "\nFlood warnings as heavy rain forecast across burnt out regions in NSW\n, Water NSW is monitoring ash and silt runoff into water catchments, including Sydney’s Warragamba Dam, \nLisa Cox, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 02.31 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 02.33 EST\n\n, Widespread rain is forecast for much of New South Wales with warnings in place for severe weather and possible flooding in some parts of the state., An initial flood watch is in place for possible riverine flooding along the coastal rivers from the Tweed to the Hastings from Thursday., A surface trough over central NSW and Queensland was beginning to bring rainfall in areas from Goondawindi to Coonamble on Wednesday., Heavier falls are expected along the north and north-east coast of NSW on Thursday and Friday before the rain extends southwards into Sydney and the South Coast over the weekend., The Bureau of Meteorology said it was possible the rainfall would extend to parts of the state with active bushfires as the weather system moves south., But Grace Legge, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said it was too early to forecast how much rain would make it to those areas., She said while rainfall was welcome, fire grounds were also more vulnerable to severe weather that could increase runoff of ash and silt into waterways., WaterNSW is monitoring forecasts for areas around the Warragamba Dam, the source of 80% of untreated supply for greater Sydney., The extent of any water quality impacts on water in the dam will depend on the timing and intensity of the rainfall., Two silt curtains designed to trap material that could pose a risk to water quality have been in place since January., “WaterNSW is working closely with the BoM to anticipate potential rain impacts in coming days,” a spokesman said., At this stage, the BoM is forecasting widespread rain of 20mm to 50mm for central Queensland and eastern NSW, with the potential for up to 100mm in some areas., The NSW Department of Primary Industries has warned agricultural producers to prepare their properties and stock for potential effects from heavy rain, thunderstorms and flash flooding., The department said on Wednesday the heavy falls would also increase the risk of organic debris ending up in waterways, which could reduce water quality and “may trigger fish deaths in already stressed river systems”., Several fish kills have already occurred this year as the result of ash from bushfires, and other organic matter and sediment, washing into local catchments., “Despite these short-term risks, the resumption of flow and subsequent replenishment of refuge holes and connectivity along waterways will provide long-term benefits to native fish populations during the current drought period,” a spokeswoman said., In Western Australia, a tropical low off the north coast is expected to develop into a tropical cyclone on Thursday morning., Legge said it was expected to deepen and could become a category three cyclone by Saturday as it moved toward land., She said there was still “large uncertainty” as to whether it would make landfall, but if it did that could occur in the region from Port Hedland down to Onslow on either Saturday or Sunday., On Wednesday there was also a flood watch in place for parts of the western and northern Kimberley.flood warnings as heavy rain forecast across burnt out regions in nsw", "label": 0}, "train-152": {"text": "\nScott Morrison insists he will not be 'bullied' as Coalition splits on climate widen\n, MP Katie Allen proposes a dedicated climate change minister but Nationals and hardline Liberals reject any policy changes, \nSarah Martin Chief political correspondent, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 01.59 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 02.02 EST\n\n, The new Liberal MP Katie Allen has canvassed the need for the government to appoint a dedicated climate change minister, as the Coalition splits on how best to “evolve” its policy response., Allen, who was elected for the seat of Higgins in May, is one of a number of Liberal MPs who have been arguing internally for the government to increase its ambition on climate change against resistance from conservatives in the Coalition., Allen’s suggestion for a climate change portfolio was made in a group chat of MPs in a discussion about how the government’s policies could be better communicated, sources have confirmed. She did not advocate in the group that the government needed to do more, but suggested there was frustration that voters were not hearing the government’s message. She argued that the “significant investment” being made by the government did not appear to be acknowledged in the community., Allen proposed that her fellow Victorian MP Tim Wilson would be a good advocate to communicate the government’s policies., Both Allen and Wilson declined to comment on the discussion., Wilson was one of the MPs who spoke in Tuesday’s partyroom in favour of more ambitious climate action and has also urged the government to consider nuclear power., His call for more action was backed up by Allen, along with the member for Reid, Fiona Martin, and the North Sydney MP, Trent Zimmerman, who argued that the government needed to ensure it respected divergent views on the issue, and acknowledged the strength of feeling for more action in inner city seats., Nationals MPs George Christensen, Barnaby Joyce and David Gillespie argued that the government should not succumb to pressure from inner city voters to do more on climate, with Joyce saying it was a “hobby horse” that was being pursued through the tragedy of bushfires., On Wednesday morning, following the partyroom stoush, Morrison said he would not “be bullied” into more action on climate change., “We listen to Australians right across the country. Not just in the inner city,” Morrison told Channel Nine., “It’s important to listen to everybody but take people forward on practical, balanced action that doesn’t go and write people’s jobs off, or industries off,” Morrison said., “It’s about technology, not taxation. So we won’t be bullied into higher taxes or higher electricity prices. What we’ll do is take practical action that deals with these challenges.”, Morrison also dismissed overnight calls from the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, for other countries to join Britain in striving for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050., “I would never make a commitment like that if I couldn’t tell the Australian people what it would cost them,” Morrison said., As the Coalition seeks to reposition on climate, Morrison faced questions in Parliament about the government’s response to the bushfires., In response to a question from the Warringah MP, Zali Steggall, asking for a bipartisan approach to climate change in the wake of the crisis, Morrison said Australia was already acting., “Emissions reduction is important. We’re acting on that reduction. I can tell you also resilience to climate is also important,” Morrison said., “Hazard reduction is important, if not more important, than emissions reduction when it comes to protecting people from fire and hotter, drier, longer summers in the future., “Also, in a country ravaged by drought, and the impacts that we have experienced, and that drought continues, building dams is climate action now.”, The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, asked Morrison why the government had not called a meeting of state governments when the bushfire crisis began – a request made in writing to the prime minister by Labor on 22 November., Morrison said the government had responded in an “unprecedented” manner to the fires, and it was “disappointing” that Labor was trying to “politicise the bushfires”., Earlier, Liberal MP John Alexander used his condolence speech on the bushfires to call climate change “the elephant in the room”., “Today is a day for commemoration, not politics. But one thing I would like to say is the need to recognise that these fires are not a warning about climate change – they are climate change,” he said., “The leader of the opposition said that ‘this is not normal’. I fear this is actually the new normal., “In focusing on saving this country for our grandchildren, we risk forgetting we need to save our neighbours. We must obviously mitigate future risks and change our ways, but we also must adapt because these longer, hotter summers will be our new normal.”, The challenge facing Morrison to balance the Coalition’s competing constituencies was further highlighted on Wednesday, when the new Nationals party deputy leader, David Littleproud, argued that the government should look to retrofit coal-fired power stations to reduce emissions., Party leader Michael McCormack, who survived a leadership challenge on Tuesday, said the government was taking action on emissions reduction in a “responsible way”., “We don’t want to be sending industry offshore. And there is a future for coal in this country.”, But despite the divergent views, home affairs minister Peter Dutton rejected suggestions the party was divided., “I don’t see huge points of difference in our party room,” he told the ABC., “Obviously, as we’ve all pointed out, we’re experiencing hotter weather, longer summers, but did the bushfires start in some of these regions because of climate change? No. It started because somebody lit a match. There are 250 people as I understand it, or more, that have been charged with arson. That’s not climate change.”, There is no evidence that anything like that number of people have been arrested over alleged arson in connection with this summer’s bushfires, let alone charged., As the political debate over climate action continues to rage, the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, told the National Press Club that the cost to the economy of bushfires and drought saying they were “a stark reminder that the economic effects of these climate events are material”.scott morrison insists he will not be bullied coalition splits climate widen", "label": 0}, "train-153": {"text": "\nCentrelink robodebt scandal: Labor cries foul over refusal to release legal advice\n, Minister refuses to provide inquiry with any advice he may have sought about legality of robodebt, \nLuke Henriques-Gomes, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 01.51 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 03.27 EST\n\n, The Morrison government has refused to release any legal advice on the botched Centrelink robodebt scheme to a Senate inquiry examining the program, prompting claims from Labor of a “whitewash”., Guardian Australia has learned that the government services minister, Stuart Robert, has refused to provide the inquiry with any legal advice the government has ever sought about the legality of the program., Citing public interest immunity, he has also declined to say when any advice may or may not have been provided or who it was prepared by, if indeed it exists., Doubt swirls over the future of the program – including how many welfare recipients will be affected by the decision to review debts that were issued using “income averaging”, a much maligned process the government abandoned late last year under the shadow of a court challenge., Labor’s government services spokesman, Bill Shorten, said the public deserved to know what led the government to believe that the “scheme was legally justified”., “There are three possibilities. Either they got bad legal advice, they got good legal advice and ignored it or they recklessly commenced their program against innocent Australians without ever seeking legal advice as to its legality,” he said., Shorten said Labor would “consider all options to fight this whitewash in the interest of giving the myriad victims of robodebt the answers they so justly deserve”., “Hundreds of thousands of Australians have had more than a billion dollars taken from them in suspect debt claims by the inaccurate robodebt scheme,” he said., In general, federal governments, including the previous Labor government, have refused to release legal advice, citing decades’ of historical precedent., A spokesman for Robert said: “It has been the long-standing practice of successive Australian governments not to disclose legal advice.”, The Senate inquiry, chaired by the Greens Rachel Siewert, was established last year amid growing public anger at the scheme., In November, the government settled a legal challenge brought by Victoria Legal Aid on behalf of a Melbourne woman. The court declared by consent that the $2,500 debt – which was issued using “income averaging” and eventually revised by Centrelink to less than $2 – was “not validly made”., Days earlier, the government overhauled the scheme, saying it would only issue debts where it had gathered evidence of the income earned by welfare recipients rather than simply averaging a person’s annual income across 26 fortnights., At the time, the attorney-general, Christian Porter, said the government would not waive privilege over any legal advice it had sought about the program., But Porter appeared to confirm the government had sought legal advice in some form. “You could imagine that any government … seeks advice on those individual matters, and that’s fed in, obviously, to decision-making in the Department of Human Services and in the minister’s office,” he said., Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday that nearly 10,000 people had joined the Gordon Legal class action demanding compensation over the scheme.centrelink robodebt scandal labor cries foul over refusal to release legal advice", "label": 0}, "train-154": {"text": "Peter Dutton says bushfires not started by climate change but arsonists – as it happened, Labor launches a sports grants inquiry while the PM deals with National party turmoil and climate debate within his party.

There are 250 people as I understand it or more that have been charged with arson. That’s not climate change., Pulled up by Patricia Karvelas that the most common start to the fires were lightning strikes, not arson, Dutton says:, Nobody’s disputing that. There’s been lightning strikes for as long as there have been bushfires in this country. , I’m happy to accept the involvement of climate change but your point was about the views in our party room. , I think the views in our party room say that we want action on climate change. Yes, we’ve got that climate change action now happening.

They have yet to be identified, and their families also have not been identified or informed as of Wednesday morning., Their deaths will be investigated as a death in police presence and subject to a mandatory inquest. Between July 1989 and June 2017, 232 people died in police pursuits in Australia. Fifty-two of those people were Indigenous., It comes two and a half years after another fatal police pursuit in Preston resulted in the death of an Indigenous man, whose family are still awaiting a coronial inquest., Police allege the pair were connected to an aggravated burglary that occurred in St Albans earlier on Tuesday night, about 7.30pm, and the alleged theft of a Mitsubishi Triton and a Volkswagen Golf., The assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said police believed those who died in the pursuit were originally in that stolen Triton, and that is why they were followed., “Following that aggravated burglary we were able to follow in particular the Mitsubishi Triton,” Cornelius, who manages the north-west metropolitan region, told reporters. “And we followed that to a hotel in Sunshine. And then we came to understand that people from that vehicle moved to a black Kluger.”, Cornelius said the Kluger was tracked by police airwing, and pursued on and off by police for about an hour. He said police would allege that it appeared to be attempting a carjacking just before 10pm, and that was what triggered the final pursuit., It crashed after driving over “stop sticks” set out by police on an on-ramp to the Western Ring Road, which deflated two of the tyres., “I would have to say that the people in that Kluger would have known that they’ve gone over stop-sticks, they would have known that their tyres had deflated, and yet they’ve continued to engage in that dangerous driving,” Cornelius said., Cornelius says the Kluger was travelling about 80km/h at one point, in a 60km/h zone, and was “speeding away from police” when it hit a truck, which then rolled over another car. No one in the truck or the other car was seriously injured., “I am very fortunate ... that I’m talking to you this morning about the deaths of only two people because there were two other innocent parties involved in that collision,” he said., He said it was a “very high impact scene”., “There is not much left of the front of the Kluger, and as a result of that the occupants of that vehicle were very seriously injured, and that is one of the reasons that we are struggling with identity,” he said., Cornelius defended the actions of police, saying that on the assessment of local police commanders, “our members can be confident that they’ve complied with the policy”., “The key point I would make is that police are not birds on a wire here,” he said. “We will not stand by and watch serious, high-end offending, which has a terrible impact on our community, we’re not going to stand by and watch it., “Where we take the view that it is safe to intervene and to interdict and stop those criminals, we will do so.”, Cornelius said he had “a sense that members did everything they could and should have last night to properly manage this situation”, adding, “of course I should also say that we are accountable”.victoria police defend pursuit after two killed in crash in melbournes northern suburbs", "label": 0}, "train-157": {"text": "\nLiberal MP John Alexander says 'these fires are climate change' – video\n, Liberal MP John Alexander has directly attributed the bushfire crisis in Australia this summer to climate change in a condolence speech delivered at Parliament House.

Because Australia exports much of these resources, many of these emissions occur overseas., The NSW Minerals Council lobbied the state government in 2019 to change laws that require the Independent Planning Commission to consider these emissions when assessing a project., It followed the NSW land and environment court’s rejection of the Rocky Hill coalmine in February, which cited the impact the mine would have on climate change, including through the burning of coal in other countries, at a time when “a rapid and deep decrease” in global emissions was urgently needed., Two other decisions by the IPC also cited the impact of climate change in their reasons for imposing conditions on a mine or rejecting it entirely., But the amendments now before the NSW parliament were drafted before the unprecedented fires that have affected much of the country., On Thursday, multiple speakers choked back tears as they spoke of the impact the bill would have at a time when Australians were living the reality of the climate crisis., “What I find so insulting, so wilfully ignorant that it leaves me white hot with anger, is that this government and some within its departments are so easily bullied by the fossil fuel lobby to even think of introducing an anti-climate bill while Australia is burning,” Julie Lyford told the hearing., Lyford is the president of Groundswell Gloucester, which argued in the Rocky Hill case that the mine would have a detrimental impact on climate change and the social fabric of the town., “The proponents of this bill are climate criminals. They will be held to account one day if this bill goes through,” she said., Dianne Montague, a member of Groundswell Gloucester, told the hearing rural communities disproportionately bore the impacts of mining and were now also “the ones bearing the burden of the impacts of climate change”., She said the community had been living with smoke from nearby fires for months., “Depression is everywhere. Everybody you talk to is depressed because of what’s happening,” she said., Doctors told the hearing that the bill was a step backward in planning for health risks from fires and other extreme events associated with climate change., Ingrid Johnston, a senior policy officer at the Public Health Association of Australia, told the hearing that the effects of global heating crossed borders. To demonstrate this, she spoke of putting a gas mask on her 11-year-old son because of severe smoke that settled over Canberra in January from fires burning in NSW., “The last couple of months have demonstrated all too clearly that bushfire smoke doesn’t respect borders. Just ask people in the west coast of New Zealand,” she said., Other speakers identified major concerns with the wording of the bill, telling the committee it could have unintended consequences., This included the NSW Minerals Council, which has been pushing for these changes., The council’s policy director, Andrew Abbey, said the proposed amendments could potentially lead to a greater risk that developments would be refused outright., “In the sense that if a project couldn’t get over the line because you can’t impose a condition on it related to scope 3 or downstream emissions the view could be formed that you subsequently don’t approve the project,” he told the hearing., Both the council and the CFMMEU said they supported the “intent” of the bill but were not sure if it achieved its stated purpose., And the Environmental Defenders Office, which acted for Groundswell Gloucester in the Rocky Hill Case, said the bill could limit planning authorities’ ability to consider all emissions associated with projects, including emissions that occur in Australia., “In terms of legal drafting, this is a mess,” the principal lawyer Elaine Johnson said after the hearing., “It’s almost impossible to determine how it would be applied.”witnesses fight back tears at nsw inquiry into anti climate scope 3 emissions law", "label": 0}, "train-165": {"text": "\nAdam Bandt: the Greens must provide hope there is an exit strategy from climate catastrophe\n, The new Australian Greens leader says the party has to connect with coal communities if it wants to be taken seriously, \nKatharine Murphy Political editor, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2020 03.41 EST\n\n, For the first time in the party’s history, the leader of the Australian Greens sits in the House of Representatives, not in the Senate. If you have to hold a lower house seat at every election, Adam Bandt says, you have to listen, and you have to be plugged in to the practical concerns of your constituents., In the seat of Melbourne, Bandt spends more time trying to get people’s Centrelink payments restored, or their broken shower working again in public housing, than he spends campaigning on climate change, and his political machine has built his vote in inner city Melbourne, election by election, by connecting with people who wouldn’t normally vote Green, and fixing practical problems., This is a transition that has to happen, but it is about people, While Bandt projects as fiercely ideological, and is, having forged his philosophy in hard left politics in Victoria, his politics has always been bread and butter at the local level. This mindset, he thinks, is the modus operandi for increasing electoral support for the Greens at a national level – an organisational model that he hopes pushes the Greens past the arid debate that has persisted since their founding about whether Australia’s environmental party is a party of protest or should have aspirations to be a potential party of government., In Melbourne, the strategy has been simple: reach out to people “who would benefit greatly from Greens policies if they were implemented but haven’t yet heard what our policies are. My strategy as leader is going to be about getting to those new groups to explain what it is that we stand for,” Bandt, who took over from fellow Victorian Richard Di Natale this week, tells Guardian Australia., “Experience suggests we do OK when that happens”., Preaching beyond the converted includes trying to connect with coal communities, where opposition to the post-material evangelism and sloganeering of green politics can be visceral. The new Greens leader starts from a different place from the environmentalists of the party’s founding cadre, having started in Labor politics, and drifted left. He has a framed picture of a coal-fired power plant on his wall – a gift from workers he represented when he was an industrial lawyer during power privatisations in Victoria., Bandt has been out in coal communities for the past couple of years, talking about the transition to low-emissions energy, in places like Lithgow and Maitland. “There would be the guys in the high vis vests sitting in the front row with their arms crossed, staring at me all the way through the presentation, and then at the end, they’d come up and say I don’t agree with everything you are saying, but at least you are the only one being honest with us,” he says., The new Greens leaders says he’ll do more venturing out into hostile country over the coming term. He says the picture of coal workers in the La Trobe valley stays on the wall to remind him who sits in the crosshairs when the Greens campaign for a rapid transition away from coal. “For me, this is a reminder that this is a transition that has to happen, but it is about people”., Bandt says the progressive side of politics has not yet won the climate war in Australia because it hasn’t stitched together the moral and scientific imperative of trying to avoid the most dangerous impact of climate change with a credible economic transformation story., “Where things haven’t worked as well as they could for progressive forces in the past is the transition plan needs to be clear, and it needs to be believable,” he says. “There is no point in telling people there may be jobs in unspecified industries in the future. It is incumbent on us to explain how we will look after people in this transition”., He says he was speaking recently to one of the school strikers, a 17 year old, who told him her anxiety about runaway climate change was now so profound she wouldn’t allow herself to think more than a year ahead., Bandt says if the environment movement and progressive politics don’t start thinking about how to deliver a grand bargain that connects the fear about change in coal communities with the increasing panic among young people and metropolitan voters about a lack of meaningful action to reduce emissions, it risks “being stuck in anxiety and anger”., He has opened his period of leadership by talking about a Green New Deal, which he characterises as “a government-led plan of investment and action to build a clean economy and a caring society”. Bandt says the purpose of this reframing of what has been a rancorous debate in Australia is to provide hope that there can be an exit strategy from catastrophe., A couple of senior members of Labor’s frontbench, Tony Burke and Chris Bowen, have also been signalling tentatively in this territory. The Greens, and Labor tentatively, have been using terminology such as “just transition” in recent election cycles, but Bowen argued recently that rhetoric is less compelling in coal communities than a stimulus package that aims to address both climate change and economic inequality., Bandt also has his eyes firmly on progressive-leaning Liberal party territory in the inner city., He says Scott Morrison managed to contain a voter backlash from Liberal supporters in seats like Kooyong and Higgins at the last election by spending large amounts of money on positive messaging about the Coalition and climate change. The prime minister told voters he had climate change under control. “He doesn’t have it under control, and we need to speak to the people Morrison was speaking to and rebut that message”. Bandt says the events of the summer provide the impetus for the Greens to speak more persuasively to small “l” Liberal voters “because people are witnessing this catastrophe for themselves”., Bandt says he wants to take a “plan heavy” approach to leading the Greens, and his ideal operating conditions are power sharing parliaments that deliver outcomes, like the one he entered in 2010., The new Greens leader contends, like all of his contemporaries, that his party has no need to apologise for joining with the Coalition to vote down Kevin Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction reduction scheme in 2009 – even though the move has been fiercely criticised for setting back action on climate change for a decade.., Bandt winds the clock forward. He says the Greens legislated a carbon price with Labor only a couple of years later. “I defend the decision that was made at the time, but even if you accept Labor’s argument that we should have done things differently, we did. That’s exactly what happened”., The new leader, as well as trying to turn a page in the climate wars, inherits a fraught unresolved debate inside his own ranks about how the party selects parliamentary leaders. Di Natale told the party’s national conference in 2016 that the Greens should consider democratising leadership ballots but the model is not yet agreed. Options include the party considering a direct vote of the membership, or a split vote of members and MPs similar to Labor’s model. There is intense frustration at the grassroots level about a lack of progress, with perceptions reform has been stymied by some members of the federal party room., Bandt chooses his words carefully when asked whether he supports democratisation. He says he’s in favour of a mixed model where the party leadership is determined by a vote split between grassroots membership and the Greens party room, similar to the model Labor has adopted, but he won’t say what the weighting should be. He says he won’t use his position as party leader to try and steer an outcome.adam bandt the greens must provide hope there is an exit strategy from climate catastrophe", "label": 0}, "train-166": {"text": "\nJulie Bishop: Coalition should lead world on climate despite 'missteps' on bushfires\n, Chancellor of Australian National University puts experts at government disposal to provide ‘evidence-based’ solutions, \nPaul Karp, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 03.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 03.04 EST\n\n, Australia “needs action on several fronts” following a catastrophic bushfire season, including leading international efforts against climate change and cutting emissions beyond the electricity sector, Julie Bishop has said., Bishop, the incoming chancellor of the Australian National University, made the comments to Guardian Australia, offering to put the university’s disaster management experts and more than 300 climate scientists at the federal government’s disposal to provide “evidence-based” responses to the bushfires., The former foreign minister and deputy Liberal leader started the ANU role in January but has postponed an event marking her appointment as the university responds to the outbreak of coronavirus and extreme weather including bushfires in the Australian Capital Territory and damage from a hailstorm., Bishop said that “clearly there have been some missteps” in the federal government’s handling of the bushfires, adding she is “certain the government will reflect on recent events and learn from any missteps”., “I as chancellor … have offered to assist the federal government in its bushfire recovery response,” she said., Bishop said the university was preparing to provide expertise in disaster recovery, public health, biodiversity, engineering, and climate science., “ANU has climate change expertise, we have expertise in bushfire recovery, 300 climate scientists across seven colleges and 25 schools., “We have the climate change institute, headed up by Mark Howden who’s on the intergovernmental climate change panel., “As a national university we have a responsibility to the Australian community to deliver evidence-based solutions … to the myriad consequences from these catastrophic events.”, The government has come under fire for its handling of climate change because the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has argued Australia contributes just 1.3% of global emissions, while lobbying to lower global ambition by including carryover credits in 2030 Paris targets., Liberal senator Jim Molan said on Monday his stance on climate change was not based on evidence, while the new deputy Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has explained he had professed doubt – but now accepts – climate science because he is not “gifted academically” and lacks a scientific background., Bishop praised Britain for being “ambitious and a leading voice in calling for greater standards to deal with climate change” after Boris Johnson urged major economies to go carbon neutral by 2050., “I’ve always been of the view that Australia, as a leading industrialised and developed nation, with one of the best standards of living in the world, needs to be a leader in the international response to climate change,” she said., “We have a responsibility. The extreme weather events, the horrific fires, that take such a terrible toll on our communities and wildlife place us at the frontline of the impact – and so Australia has a direct interest in leading international debate on this topic., “I certainly look forward to our government taking on that role.”, Asked how Morrison should balance Nationals and Liberal conservatives wanting more coal-fired power with moderate Liberals’ calls to do more to fight global heating, Bishop responded that Morrison “doesn’t need my advice”., “We need action on several fronts: disaster response, including the resourcing of emergency fire services; climate change mitigation and adaptation; and reducing our own emissions is obviously vital – but we have to focus on all areas, not just the electricity sector,” she said., Despite Morrison claiming the government has set out how it will reduce emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030, critics have noted it is yet to set vehicle emissions standards or a plan to reduce emissions in the transport and agriculture sectors., Bishop backed the Morrison government on its handling of the coronavirus, despite criticism from Universities Australia that Australian Border Force had overreacted by reportedly detaining Chinese students returning to Australia after the travel ban., Bishop said she assumed all measures were taken after “consultation with national and international health bodies”., ANU, like many other universities, has offered flexible arrangements to help its students affected by virus-related travel bans including online delivery of courses, intensive courses and deferral without penalty., Bishop said she was “not aware of any evidence” that Australia’s relationship with China had slowed evacuations from Wuhan or had suffered as a result of travel bans., Bishop listed among other priorities for the ANU to equip students and graduates for the fourth industrial revolution and disruption of traditional work, and to gain greater international recognition for the university., Since retiring from politics at the 2019 election Bishop has also taken a role on the board of foreign aid contractor Palladium which she insists is not a breach of ministerial standards, which ban ministers lobbying on “any matters on which they have had official dealings” in the previous 18 months.julie bishop coalition should lead world on climate despite missteps on bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-167": {"text": "\nAFP’s failure to investigate Angus Taylor has corrosive consequences for our democracy\n, People not being held accountable when falsehoods happen is incredibly harmful, Contact author, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 02.58 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 03.05 EST\n\n, Precision matters, so let’s be very precise. The Australian federal police has not conducted a deep dive into what went on in Angus Taylor’s office – how it came to pass that a dodgy document was deployed in a political attack against the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore., The police haven’t investigated. They have declined to investigate., According to the AFP’s statement issued on Thursday, the New South Wales police handed them “information” about the inquiry they had undertaken last year into the controversy. The AFP perused this information and determined “it is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence”., Now this is kind of curious, because nobody at any point asked the police to consider whether a commonwealth offence had been committed. The referral was very precise. It asked for an assessment of whether an offence had been committed under NSW law., Having assessed the NSW investigation – after the NSW police kindly passed the political hot potato on to the constabulary in Canberra – the AFP determined there was “no evidence” to indicate the minister for energy and emissions reduction was involved in falsifying information., This is a relief of course, but it always seemed highly unlikely Taylor himself would have authored a career-ending dodgy document as a bit of comic relief between cabinet submissions., So why is the arbitration narrowed to what the minister did or did not do?, Also, it is entirely unclear how this “no evidence” determination was reached. By speaking to Angus Taylor? By looking at electronic records? The AFP has declined to say whether police interviewed the minister, or staff, or others, as part of this process., The AFP has justified its decision not to investigate (again being clear what has actually happened here) because of the “low level of harm” associated with the episode, and because Taylor apologised for using false figures when he accused the council of undertaking travel that wasn’t actually undertaken., Let’s pause here a moment and consider “low level of harm”. Now it’s obvious to say harm is an eye-of-the-beholder concept, but it probably pays at this juncture to recap the central facts of this case., To explain the otherwise inexplicable, Taylor has always insisted that his office accessed an early version of the Sydney City Council annual report, and that version contained different travel figures than the report that appears on the website currently., Taylor’s problem is there has never been any concrete evidence, at least in the public domain, to substantiate that claim. Now perhaps the police fared better than the rest of us, but the minister never provided any proof to the parliament or to journalists., The City of Sydney for its part produced detailed evidence of its metadata and screenshots from the system used to manage its website. That material showed the publicly available documents had not changed since they were first uploaded – with the correct and accurate figures – in November last year., The evidence supplied by the council suggests the document Taylor’s office used wasn’t ever on the council website. So if that’s correct, where did this false document come from? Who authored it? Why did they do that?, And most importantly, why are there no consequences for doing that?, Sticking with the sliding scale of harm, it is true that nobody is ever going to lose any sleep over an issue as micro as the size of the Sydney City Council travel budget, and whether a commonwealth cabinet minister thinks it’s a good use of his time to pick a student politics fight with a local government official., But I suspect a number of us do care if documents have been falsified and whether fake documents are being deployed in public debate., That would seem to me to be quite harmful activity in an age where citizens in democracies don’t know who, or what, to trust in politics and public life, and are suspicious of institutions that once enjoyed significant levels of respect., Not being able to determine what’s true, and people not being held accountable when falsehoods happen, is incredibly harmful. It’s more than harmful, actually. Corrosive is a better word., In deciding not to investigate, the AFP also determined that getting to the bottom of the Taylor/Moore imbroglio would require a “significant” level of resources., Really? Would it require more than the small phalanx of police who sifted through the underwear drawer of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst last year after she was raided after publishing information that was clearly in the public interest?, More resources than that?, Seems pretty unlikely, doesn’t it., Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editorafps failure to investigate angus taylor has corrosive consequences for our democracy", "label": 0}, "train-168": {"text": "\nUK foreign minister urges Australia to strive for net zero emissions by 2050\n, Dominic Raab calls on government to work with other countries to cut carbon pollution, saying Britain wants a ‘step change’ in international response to climate crisis, \nSarah Martin, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 02.06 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 02.09 EST\n\n, The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has called on Australia to work with other countries to bring down carbon pollution as it works towards the “challenge” of achieving net zero emissions by 2050., Raab, who met with Australia’s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne on Thursday, said the pair had a “good constructive conversation” about Britain’s goal to reduce emissions as it prepared to host the United Nations climate summit, COP26, in Glasgow later this year., The visit to Australia is the first overseas visit for the UK foreign secretary since Britain officially exited the European Union six days ago., When asked about Australia’s policy record on climate change, which was a “politically contentious” issue in the wake of the summer bushfire crisis, Raab said the UK’s approach was to “try to make a success” of COP26., He said Britain wanted a “step change” in the international response to climate change, which he described as the “challenge of our times”., “We are going to talk to all the countries about their contributions in getting emissions down,” Raab said., “I think there is an exciting opportunity, there is a challenge but there is also an opportunity, and we are want to lead in rising to that challenge and we have had a really good conversation about it today.”, He said there was potential for Australia and the UK to be “natural collaborators” on reducing carbon emissions, naming the greening of financial services and “technical cooperation” as possible areas., While he declined to comment on whether more ambitious climate policy would be a requirement of the post-Brexit free trade agreement to be signed between Australia and the UK, he said Britain was looking for a “team effort right across the board”., “We hope to be leading by example with our commitment to get emissions down to net zero by 2050 but there is a whole range of other things that we need to talk about and what we have got to try to do is make it a win-win,” he said., “It is a huge challenge … but we have got, and I know that Australia has got, the innovators, the entrepreneurs who can come up with green technology which can help find a way forward., “We have had a really good constructive conversation about it and we will continue that conversation with our Australian friends, but also all of the other big players in that debate.”, Payne said in the lead-up to COP26, the Australian government would be looking at what “practical climate action we can take together”., Raab was also due to meet with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Thursday afternoon., Morrison has refused to back the goal of net zero emissions by 2050, despite signing on to a communique at the Pacific Islands Forum that committed to develop a 2050 strategy this year., Following calls from the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, for other countries to join Britain in striving for net-zero 2050 target, Morrison said the Australian government would not adopt policies that were about “putting taxes on people, putting their electricity prices up or driving industries out of regional areas”., “I would never make a commitment like that if I couldn’t tell the Australian people what it would cost them,” Morrison said., The prime minister is under pressure from within his own party room to increase the government’s climate change action, but moderate MPs are facing pushback from conservatives., On Thursday, Morrison was asked how he would balance a proposed transition to cleaner energy with calls from Queensland Nationals MPs to build new coal-fired power stations and retrofit existing coal plants to reduce emissions., The prime minister said the government had adopted a “common sense position” that recognised that the reliability of Australia’s electricity system depended on coal., “It understands the need for the maintenance and sweating of those assets which are providing reliability to the system,” Morrison said., “And where those types of assets in the future can be developed in the way that would be required under the environmental standards, then that’s not ruled out either. So it’s common sense. It’s a common sense, well-balanced policy. And I think that embraces everybody, not just in the Liberal party room, but right across the Coalition.”, When asked if this meant the government could use taxpayer funds to retrofit existing coal-fired power stations to reduce emissions, Morrison left the option open., “We work with all the energy companies because we know that we don’t want to force people’s power prices up and we don’t want to see a loss of capacity out of the system that is unnecessary. And so we take all of these decisions in the national interest.”uk foreign minister urges australia to strive for net zero emissions by 2050", "label": 0}, "train-169": {"text": "\nLabor asks AEC to investigate Liberal party over Morrison ally donation 'error'\n, Scott Briggs, a key bidder for the massive contract to privatise Australia’s visa processing system, denies making $165,000 donation, \nChristopher Knaus, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 01.46 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 01.49 EST\n\n, Labor has asked the Australian electoral commission to investigate why the Liberal party declared and then removed a $165,000 donation from the company of a Scott Morrison ally and key bidder for a $1bn government contract., The Liberals are still refusing to explain how they could have mistakenly declared a $165,000 donation from Southern Strategy, a company linked to Liberal heavyweight Scott Briggs. Briggs is leading a consortium of companies hoping to win the massive contract to privatise Australia’s visa processing system., The donation appeared in the Liberal party’s original disclosures to the AEC, but was removed after it was queried by the Guardian on Wednesday. Briggs said he’d never made the donation and the Liberals said it was a mistake., The shadow assistant immigration minister, Andrew Giles, said it was “entirely unclear” how the Liberals could have accidentally declared a donation – complete with details of the company, its address and a specific amount – if it did not occur., Giles wrote to the AEC and asked it to urgently investigate the matter., “In the interests of transparency and accountability, it’s imperative that this matter be properly examined,” he said., “I ask that you investigate this issue as a matter of urgency to ensure that all disclosure requirements have been met.”, Briggs has denied ever having made the Southern Strategy donation and left it to the Liberal party to explain how it came to wrongly declare the $165,000 donation., “All I can confirm is that Southern Strategy made no donations to the Liberal party,” he said this week., Guardian Australia again approached the Liberals for an explanation on Thursday. A spokesman said only that Southern Strategy had not made a donation to the Liberal party “either directly or in-kind” and that the the party was amending its return to “correct the error”. That casts doubt on any possibility that Southern Strategy had provided some kind of gift “in-kind” – including free work or services – to the Liberal party., Labor has previously raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest in the tender process for the $1bn visa privatisation contract. The government intends to privatise its visa processing system to streamline and save costs, a plan critics fear will cost public service jobs, pose a risk to sensitive personal data, and put power over visa decisions into the hands of private companies., The Community and Public Sector Union national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said the visa privatisation must be stopped and the donations ought to be investigated., “A wide range of organisations across the nation are coming together and calling on the government to ditch this plan, all concerned with the massive risks involved; cost of visas, worker exploitation, economic impact, data security breaches and national security concerns,” Donnelly said. “Visa privatisation is a friendless plan.”, A consortium named Australian Visa Processing Pty Ltd – which involves Briggs and his investment firm Pacific Blue Capital – is one of two reported frontrunners for the contract., Briggs is also a close ally of Morrison’s, a former colleague of immigration minister David Coleman, and a state deputy director of the NSW Liberal party., In its declaration to the AEC, the Liberals listed the address of Southern Strategy as the same George Street office as Australian Visa Processing and Pacific Blue Capital.labor asks aec to investigate liberal party over morrison ally donation error", "label": 0}, "train-170": {"text": "AFP drops Angus Taylor investigation as Morrison reshuffles cabinet – as it happened, Australian federal police decide not to pursue an inquiry over doctored documents.

I refer to recent comments made by the former minister for defence, Christopher Pyne, in conversation with the former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, on the 20 January 2020 episode of the Pyne Time podcast. In the conversation, Mr Pyne commented on the malicious intrusion into the Australian Parliament House computer network, discovered in early 2019, stating that he and Mr Parkinson knew ‘how much worse it all was’ and that they ‘could never talk about it’. , Putting aside the extraordinary indiscretion of a former minister for defence making comments of this kind, I refer to your statement to the House on 12 February 2019 about the extent of this attack. , I know that you appreciate the seriousness of public confidence in this institution and I acknowledge and thank you for your written response to my correspondence with you on this matter. I ask whether for the benefit of the House you could share your response to Mr Pyne’s comments., Smith:, I first thank the member for Gellibrand for bringing the matter to my attention in writing. I have replied, as he said, outlining – in fact, I’ve replied jointly with the president of the Senate. I think it is important that I do, given these comments have been made, make a statement to the House, which I’ll do now., I’m only aware of the comments thanks to the member for Gellibrand, but I’ll just say this: following discovery of the cybersecurity incident in January of last year, as members would be aware, the president and I, as we have said, received detailed briefings from the Australian Signals Directorate and the Department of Parliamentary Services. Communication and management of the incidents was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network. Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security. But any inference that our statements to the parliament on this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false. I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself., I finally say the podcast also refers to a cyberintrusion at the Australian National University, which is in the transcript that you kindly forwarded to me. So perhaps it shouldn’t be inferred that the comments necessarily relate to the parliamentary network. , The important point is that the president and I have no further information or knowledge as to what Mr Pyne meant with his comments, and I thank the member for Gellibrand again., Updated\nat 1.25am EST\n, \n\n12.47am EST\n00:47\n\n, Paul Karp, Senator Jacqui Lambie has been asked on ABC Afternoon Briefing about her proposed amendments to the union penalty bill., As Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday, Lambie is trying to strike a deal with the government “as soon as possible” on the bill, which lowers the threshold for deregistering unions or disqualifying their officials., Lambie replied: “We are still talking through those amendments ... The hold-up is when it comes to, there’s a points system, on whether or not it’s constitutional, so that’s what we’re doing at the moment. I do believe that the other amendments are sitting there, there’s just a couple of other issues and one of them is the points system. That could be a little bit constitutional. So do we work it around so we still get the same result and the same outcome and we’re just trying to tie that in now”., That’s a very interesting answer. The points system was introduced by Centre Alliance amendments as a sort-of three strikes policy to prevent disqualification of union officials for minor offences. The government accepted the amendments in a bid to pass the bill., It’s possible Lambie has blown the whistle on a problem not just with her proposed amendments but the scheme of the bill put to the Senate and defeated in November.I’ve asked the attorney general, Christian Porter, to clarify., Updated\nat 12.50am EST\n, \n\n12.46am EST\n00:46\n\n, OK, it took some transcription time, but we got there., At the end of question time, Tim Watts raised an issue with Tony Smith, asking about comments the former minister Christopher Pyne made in his podcast with the former Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary Martin Parkinson., Pyne and Parkinson were talking about the breach of the parliamentary network last year on the podcast, which led to this exchange:, Parkinson: I’m amazed, actually, at how little concern is expressed by the public when these breaches occur., Pyne: Everyone almost factors it in, don’t they?, Parkinson: Yeah., Pyne: They think “oh well”., Parkinson: Look at ANU, at what’s happened. I’m not blaming ANU but just saying we should be appalled by this. Look at what happened at Parliament House. We should be appalled., Pyne: You and I know how much worse it all was, which we could never talk about (laughs)., Parkinson: No (laughs)., Watts asked Smith whether this is something Pyne should be joking about, and whether he had gone past his boundaries by hinting there was more to what the public was told about the breach., Smith said he was unaware of what Pyne was talking about:, Communication and management of the incident was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network,” Smith said., Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security., But any inference that our statements to the parliament to this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false.

How did this occur? That’s what he should do. You shouldn’t need outside organisations., A PM who actually cared about integrity would have dealt with this. The PM quite clearly doesn’t care about integrity., And I make this point as well – and I’ll conclude with this – Australia needs a national integrity commission. , We need one with real power to make independent investigations. The fact is that faith in our politics is at an all-time low. , It’s at an all-time low because of the sports rorts saga that we can see. , ... Angus Taylor of course has been involved in a Watergate scandal, he’s been involved in the issue around Jam Land and his declarations to the parliament. , He’s been involved in this document where we still don’t know where it came from. , We know it was given from his office to the Daily Telegraph. Where did it come from? , They can’t just say we don’t know because quite clearly someone does know. , We know it didn’t come from the City of Sydney because the police in their investigation went to the City of Sydney and went through their data. , Now why the data of minister Taylor’s office wasn’t gone through is a question for others to answer., Updated\nat 12.11am EST\n, \n\n11.57pm EST\n23:57\n\n, Anthony Albanese:, ... If you look at Stuart Robert’s answer today to my question in parliament, it is clear he knows they will have to pay money back. It was clearly implied. , And I will make two points in addition to the point that Bill has been making, and I praise Bill for what he has done in pursuing this issue. , The fact is, every single person who came to my electoral office seeking assistance either got their debt reduced to zero or got it reduced substantially. Without exception. , The truth is the most vulnerable people in our society don’t go to their local MP’s office. , People from non-English-speaking backgrounds, in some cultures if you get a demand letter from the government, you rush and you pay that money even if you don’t have it – you borrow it from a relative.

Except to say the statue of Trim and the absence of any dedicated to Bungaree, and the spending of millions of dollars on a voyage by a replica Endeavour that Cook never actually undertook, brings into stark relief the ridiculous disparities in who we have come to publicly venerate and commemorate in Australia., If Flinders and, not least, his cat, are deserving of statues on Sydney’s main commemorative street, it should go without saying Bungaree ought to be there too, in statuary, for all that he brought to that circumnavigation and the early colony of New South Wales. Such is the enduring colonisation of Australian national memory and commemoration – as well as history., There is a small park in Sydney’s east, really just a green patch in the shade of towering eucalypts and palms, on a corner of New South Head Road near Cranbrook Grammar School, named Bungaree Reserve. It’s where Bungaree was buried after his death at 55 in 1830, as one of the best known – or infamous – Aboriginal men around Port Jackson. , Bungaree or “Boongarie”, besides being a seaman and tribal leader, was on close terms with several early governors including Lachlan Macquarie and Thomas Brisbane. At a time when the early colony’s pastoral frontier was creeping inexorably north and west amid increasing dispossession and violent encounters between Indigenous tribes, the settlers and redcoats, Bungaree was a diplomat of sorts – a bridge between the empire and his civilisation that had been around the port for tens of thousands of years., Like Bennelong before him, much has been made in Australian historiography of Bungaree’s supposed capture between two worlds and descent into drunkenness (in a colony whose lifeblood was grog), ill-health and vagrancy. But other historians portray a man wise to the racial realpolitik of colonial advancement. Among them are Keith Vincent Smith, an expert on the Eora of the Sydney region and biographer of bother Bennelong and Bungaree., Macquarie, who ordered several bloody punitive actions against the tribes around Sydney – including at Appin in 1816 where he used “terror” tactics to murder Aboriginal people resisting the pastoralists – set aside land for Bungaree and his people near present day Mosman and bestowed him with a boat for fishing and a breast plate inscribed, “Boongaree, chief of the Broken Bay Tribe”. A portion of the catch from his boat would go to the colonists, the rest to his people., “As soon as any ship came through the Sydney Heads, Bungaree would arrive in his fishing boat, rowed by two of his wives. Dressed in an old military jacket, tattered trousers and his trademark hat, he climbed on board to welcome newcomers to ‘his’ country. Doffing his hat, bowing deeply and grinning widely, Bungaree would ask to drink the captain’s health in rum or brandy. He then inspected the ship’s pantry and levied his ‘tribute’, which he received in the form of ‘presents’ or ‘loans’,” Vincent Smith writes., “A clever mimic, Bungaree could imitate the walk, gestures and expressions of past governors of New South Wales. Like Shakespeare’s clown in Twelfth Night, he was ‘wise enough to play the fool’ and used his humorous talents to obtain clothes, tea, tobacco, bread, sugar and rum for himself and his people.”, Historian Geoffrey Dutton viewed him as astute more than clown-like, writing: “He mocked the white men by mocking himself.”, All of this came after Bungaree’s voyages with Flinders (and Trim!) during which he acted as an emissary (even though he did not share their languages) to the other Indigenous people they encountered. He became the first Indigenous man – and the first Australian-born one – to circumnavigate Australia, although the voyages were also fraught and marked with tense and sometimes violent interactions with other Indigenous peoples., He was often in considerable danger when communicating on behalf of Flinders and Phillip Parker King, with whom he sailed 15 years later to finish charting sections of the continental coast that weren’t completed during the circumnavigation., Bungaree spent the last months of his life ill and malnourished, before his death – among his people – at Garden Island., While many colonial and visiting artists painted portraits of Bungaree (the best-known is probably Augustus Earle’s, held by the National Library of Australia), in death he was, it seems, afforded less dignity. There is evidence his body was exhumed, decapitated and his head sent to the Australian Museum, which had been involved in digging up and collecting Aboriginal remains around the colony. , Among the many disturbing aspects of British colonisation of Australia was the feverish trade that grew around Indigenous human remains, tens of thousands of which were taken from massacre sites, stolen from graves and burial grounds, and sent to collecting institutions in Australia and abroad. Thousands remain overseas., There are many statues of Flinders and the cat, Trim, including one at Australia House in London, dedicated in 2014., It’s beyond time that the first of Bungaree is cast and unveiled on Macquarie Street., If the federal government can spend $50-plus million celebrating the sestercentennial of Cook’s arrival – including almost $7m on a replica Endeavour circumnavigation that the great navigator never, in history, undertook – surely it can stump up for a monument to the first Australian who did actually sail right around the continent., National memory and Bungaree deserve no less., • Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist flinders and his cat get statues so why not the aboriginal man who sailed with them", "label": 0}, "train-173": {"text": "\nBowraville families distressed after police release historic sexual assault allegations\n, Aboriginal community says police should have spoken to them before issuing a public call for information, \nLorena Allam, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 23.59 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 01.03 EST\n\n, The families of three missing and murdered Aboriginal children from the New South Wales north coast community of Bowraville have slammed the police for publicly releasing information about allegations of historical sexual assaults related to the small town without talking to them first., “We have been blindsided by this,” the Bowraville family representatives, Michelle Jarrett and Leonie Duroux, said., “Our community and our families are already traumatised by the deaths of our children and the previous police conduct., “We haven’t even been told if today’s allegations are linked to the loss of our three children., “We thought that police had finally learned to do better,” they said., Earlier today, NSW police issued a public call for information about a series of sexual assaults that happened in the Wollongong area in the mid-1990s, saying they “believe the town of Bowraville could hold the key” to their investigation., “We believe there may be people living in the Bowraville area who may have information that could prove vital to this investigation, and we want to hear from those people,” Detective Chief Inspector Brad Ainsworth said in the statement about alleged sexual and indecent assaults committed by a man between 1991 and 1997 on a 14-year-old girl., But distressed Bowraville family members say they have not been told if this conduct is related to the murders of their children, or if other children have potentially been the victims of sexual assaults., “If this is not about our murdered children then of course we should have been told about this before., “Our hearts go out to any family that has seen their children harmed in any way, and of course we are willing to help if we have any information. However, we need to be treated with respect and not have our ongoing trauma trampled on., “Why are we always the last to know and keep finding things out through media reports and not through respectful and direct communication with the police?, “We are still waiting for an answer about our kids and our trauma, but we are used to waiting and we will always be committed to justice,” Jarrett said., The public call by NSW police has come before the NSW government has formally responded to the most recent parliamentary inquiry into the Bowraville murders., The UTS Distinguished Professor Larissa Behrendt, who has supported the Bowraville families for almost a decade, said “despite constant requests from the Bowraville community to be treated with respect, despite a parliamentary inquiry that found a history of poor engagement with this community, it appears there remains no respect. It appears no lessons were learnt.”, Greens MP David Shoebridge said: “Once again the Bowraville families are first hearing about crimes in their community through the media and the disrespect from police continues. , “These are grieving families who have never received justice, this kind of behaviour aggravates their ongoing trauma.,  “Aboriginal lives matter, and Aboriginal families should be treated with respect and courtesy.”, In February 1991 the remains of 16-year-old Clinton “Speedy” Duroux were found in bushland. In April that year clothing was discovered belonging to 16-year-old Colleen Walker-Craig, and a week later the skeletal remains of 4-year-old Evelyn Greenup were found in the bush., All three children disappeared from the same street on the southern side of Bowraville. Police believe all three were killed by the same person: a white man who has since been tried and acquitted of two of the three murders. The police investigation was found to be flawed and tainted by racism., In the almost 30 years since the murders, there have been two criminal trials, two inquests, changes to criminal law in NSW, four rejected attempts to have the cases reheard as a joint trial, a landmark parliamentary inquiry and an appeal to the high court, which was rejected in March last year., Following the failed high court bid the NSW attorney general, Mark Speakman, issued an apology to the families., “I hope that those mistakes are never repeated again,” Speakman said., “I am sorry that those failings continue to deny the children, and their families, the justice that they deserve.”, NSW police have been sought for comment.bowraville families distressed after police release historic sexual assault allegations", "label": 0}, "train-174": {"text": "\nAngus Taylor: AFP drops investigation into doctored documents scandal\n, Australian federal police says no evidence energy minister ‘was involved in falsifying information’ he used to attack Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore’s record on climate change, \nPaul Karp and \nAnne Davies, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 22.48 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 02.53 EST\n\n, The Australian federal police has dropped its investigation into a doctored document used by energy minister Angus Taylor to attack Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore’s record on climate change., On Thursday the AFP confirmed it had finalised the matter because it had “determined it is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence”., “The AFP assessment of this matter identified there is no evidence to indicate the minister for energy and emissions reduction was involved in falsifying information,” an AFP spokesman said., “The low level of harm and the apology made by the minister to the Lord Mayor of Sydney, along with the significant level of resources required to investigate were also factored into the decision not to pursue this matter.”, Taylor welcomed the news and accused Labor of a “track record of using police referrals as a political tool”., “The leader of the opposition Anthony Albanese and shadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus’s pursuit of this matter is a shameful abuse of their office and a waste of our policing agencies’ time,” he said in a statement., But Dreyfus and shadow climate change minister Mark Butler said that “serious questions remain unanswered” about the scandal because “two police investigations have now failed to clarify where Angus Taylor got his dodgy figures from”., Clover Moore said: “I am shocked and disappointed the AFP will not further investigate the matter and shed light on a situation that has further eroded the community’s faith in the federal government.”, Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore, declares a climate emergency, which is endorsed by the council., 29 September: The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, writes to Clover Moore, claiming the council’s annual report “shows your council spent $1.7m on international travel and $14.2m on domestic travel” in 2017-18., The Daily Telegraph publishes a story on page three and online accusing Moore of hypocrisy over the council’s emissions. The story quotes a letter from Taylor which says the council spent more than $15m on domestic and international travel., Moore disputes the Telegraph story and asks the reporter to provide evidence of this claim., The reporter provides a page from the council’s annual report. The page contains two figures purporting to show the council spent “$14.2” in expenses on interstate travel and “$1.7” on overseas visits. , Moore checks the annual report: on page 14 it shows councillors spent $4,206.32 on interstate travel and $1,727.77 on overseas visits. Moore angrily disputes the story with Taylor via Twitter., Moore writes to Taylor asking him to “ correct a stark error in your letter” saying the $15m figure was grossly inaccurate., Moore lodges complaint with the Press Council., The document, which contained grossly inflated travel figures for the 10 Sydney city councillors – it claimed they had spent $15m in a year – was quoted in a letter sent by Taylor to Moore on 29 September and provided to the Daily Telegraph, which used the figures in an article published the same day., Labor referred the issue to the New South Wales police in October, questioning whether the document constituted a forgery used to influence an official in the conduct of their duty, and whether Taylor could have committed an offence by failing to report it., The NSW police established strike force Garrad to investigate, but Taylor did not stand down, receiving the backing of Scott Morrison to stay in his ministerial position., Morrison personally contacted the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, by phone, leading to allegations, which were strongly denied, he had influenced the investigation., In November Fuller said he believed the matter would be wrapped up in a week. “To be honest with you, I actually don’t feel as though the allegations themselves are serious, in terms of the things that I would normally stand up and talk about the types of crimes,” he said., Evidence supplied by the council, The council has provided evidence that the documents on its website have not been changed since they were first uploaded on November 27, 2018. , It has supplied screenshots from its content management system – the system used to maintain its website - which shows the PDF version was last updated at 11:01am on November 27 2018 and the Word document was last updated at 2:53pm on the same date. , Both documents showed the accurate travel expense figures when they were first uploaded, and have not changed since., Metadata check, The Guardian has corroborated this by performing its own checks of the metadata attached to the two files currently on the council’s website., They show that the PDF document currently on the council’s website was last modified on 27 November 2018 and the Word document was created on 19 November 2018 by an executive at a creative agency, Satsuma Creative’s Kirsten Dreese., Internet archive records, Though not conclusive, checks of the internet archive – a system that takes sporadic snapshots of websites over time – lend weight to the suggestion that the documents have not changed since they were uploaded., Three archived versions of the council’s annual report are available and display the accurate figures in March, April, and June., Scrutiny of formatting, The formatting and line spacing of the document used by Taylor’s office suggests it was originally a Word document, before being converted to PDF in some way., Document lodged with minister, The City of Sydney is also obliged by local government laws to provide a copy of its annual report to the NSW Minister for Local Government. After that it is not permitted to alter the document.  , On 20 December, the NSW Police referred the matter to the AFP, reportedly because if any crime were committed, it would have occurred in Canberra, not Sydney., Taylor has “unreservedly” apologised to Moore for relying on the falsified figures but has denied consistently that either he, or anyone in his office, altered the City of Sydney document to inflate travel expenditure. Taylor has said the document with the incorrect numbers was obtained from the council website., But the council has produced evidence showing that its publicly available annual reports has only ever contained accurate figures. Metadata and screenshots from the council’s content management system showed the annual reports on its website had not been changed since they were originally uploaded., In a statement Dreyfus and Butler noted Taylor had assured parliament the fabricated report was “directly downloaded” from the City of Sydney Council website but public archives show “the correct version of the report was on the internet all through 2019”., “If Angus Taylor continues to refuse to come clean, then the prime minister must order a proper, independent and transparent investigation into his minister, and commit to making the findings public.”, Moore said it was “nearly beyond belief that the minster is still, after months of intense scrutiny, yet to explain the origin of the fraudulent document he used to accuse the City of egregious spending on travel”.angus taylor afp drops investigation into doctored documents scandal", "label": 0}, "train-175": {"text": "\nWilliam Tyrrell disappearance: widower claims detective pushed him to plead guilty, court hears\n, Allegedly illegal recording made by Gary Jubelin while investigating toddler’s disappearance played to Sydney court, Australian Associated Press, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 22.10 EST\n\n, A fiery exchange in which a widower accuses the New South Wales homicide detective Gary Jubelin of telling him to plead guilty over William Tyrrell’s disappearance has been played in a Sydney court., In the allegedly illegally recorded conversation, William’s neighbour, Paul Savage, says he doesn’t want to speak to Jubelin – a day after the officer suggested the widower may have accidentally killed the three-year-old boy in 2014., “A three-year-old has disappeared and you don’t want to help?” Jubelin said at Savage’s home on 3 May 2018., “I beg your pardon, I’ve helped you every way I can,” Savage replied., Savage lived across the street from William and was among hundreds of persons of interest. Police interviewed him on several occasions before May 2018., Jubelin, 57, is facing a court hearing over allegations he illegally recorded four conversations with Savage in 2017 and 2018 while investigating the toddler’s disappearance from the mid-north coast town of Kendall in September 2014., The former detective chief inspector has pleaded not guilty., The 3 May recording, made on Jubelin’s phone and played to Downing Centre local court on Thursday, was not covered by a surveillance device warrant active at the time, the crown alleges., The recording captures Jubelin and Savage accusing each other of being untruthful at times during the investigation., “You’re the one who started pushing me away, I’ve had you go through my house ... you just want to put shit on me,” Savage said., “You told me to plead guilty.”, Jubelin denies ever telling Savage to plead guilty, “Paul, you seriously need some (mental health) help,” he said., Savage told Jubelin he had been speaking to a solicitor and had been instructed not to allow police onto his property without a warrant., Throughout the recordings Jubelin has been charged over, Savage denies any involvement in the disappearance of William., An officer no longer working on the investigation said based on her limited knowledge, Savage was no longer a person of interest., Jubelin quit the force in 2019., No one has been charged over William’s disappearance., The hearing continues.william tyrrell disappearance widower claims detective pushed him to plead guilty court hears", "label": 0}, "train-176": {"text": "\nGovernment was warned robodebt scheme was unlawful – but won't say when\n, Emails between senior tax office officials reveal advice came on the same day the government announced it was overhauling the scheme , \nLuke Henriques-Gomes, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 21.43 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 22.46 EST\n\n, The government received legal advice that debts issued under the botched robodebt scheme were unlawful, confidential documents provided to a Senate committee have revealed., Emails between top tax office officials published on Thursday show that the agency was told by the Department of Social Services that debts based solely on the controversial “income averaging” method were “not lawful debts”., The 19 November email, from the Australian Taxation Office’s general counsel, Jonathan Todd, to the ATO commissioner, Chris Jordan, was marked “Sensitive: Legal”, and was sent on the same day the Morrison government  announced it was overhauling the scheme., “In further discussion with DSS, it appears that what you need to raise is: they have advised you that they have received legal advice that debts based solely upon DSS own income averaging of ATO annual tax data are not lawful debts (‘robodebts’),” the email stated., “They have also suspended the raising and recovery of robodebts as of today.”, In the email, Todd told Jordan that “in view of that legal advice … it appears that ‘robodebts’ are not debts due to the commonwealth”., The email did not say when the government received the advice. On 27 November, a federal court judgment was published revealing that the government had settled a court challenge brought by Victoria Legal Aid to a debt issued against a Melbourne woman. Legal Aid said the decision – which stated that the debt was “not validly made” – represented a rebuke to the legality of all debts raised under the process., The ATO was drawn into the saga because it was asked to garnishee tax refunds to recoup money over alleged debts, a practice that Guardian Australia revealed Services Australia was accelerating last year, and because alleged debts are partly identified using welfare recipients’ tax returns., Todd told Jordan he was “not in a position to garnish robodebts when served a notice under s 1233 of the Social Security Act, as the notice would not be in respect of a valid legal debt”., The government overhauled the program and is now reviewing hundreds of thousands of debts, but it has never publicly conceded that the entire scheme was unlawful. It is also facing a class action from Gordon Legal that has garnered nearly 10,000 interested parties., The email was one of six published by the Senate inquiry into the robodebt scheme following a request from senators to the ATO for correspondence discussing the government’s decision to overhaul the program., Labor’s government services spokesman, Bill Shorten, said the emails showed the government put the “emergency brakes on its pet scheme because it knows it is unlawful” while the inquiry chair, Greens senator Rachel Siewert, said the public deserved to know when it received the advice., “In junking the scheme, the minister Stuart Robert referred to the changes as a ‘refinement’,” Shorten said., “Since the government maintains it has done nothing wrong then it should have nothing to fear from openly revealing what it knew about robodebt’s legality and when.”, Siewert said: “This is a fundamental question and with the government making a claim of public interest immunity over the release of legal advice it is clear that they don’t want Australia to know.”, The government services minister, Stuart Robert, declined to address the legality of the scheme during Question Time on Thursday, reiterating his claim that the overhaul represented “refinements” to make the program more “robust”., Robert said his department, Services Australia, was “carefully and methodically working to identify those customers whose debts may have been calculated using averaged income data., “It’s not appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of this process and we’ll advise the House in the future when that process comes to its conclusion,” he said., Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that Robert, the government services minister, had declined to provide the committee with any legal advice the government had about the scheme, citing a precedent set by past Coalition and Labor governments., In a less common move, he also declined to state when any advice might have been received, noting that the government was still defending the class action., Since 2017, the government had defended the robodebt scheme as a legitimate method of recouping money owed by welfare recipients, despite a string of cases in which inaccurate debts were issued., Until November, it had sought to improve the scheme, but stood by its general premise., The tax office and Robert have been contacted for comment.government warned robodebt scheme unlawful but wont say when", "label": 0}, "train-177": {"text": "\n'Hysterical and ruinous': Christmas Island furious over Australia's coronavirus plans\n, \n'Hysterical and ruinous': Christmas Island furious over Australia's coronavirus plans\n, There is disquiet over the decision to quarantine Wuhan evacuees on an island that thought it had left behind its prison image, \nBen Doherty on Christmas Island, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 21.07 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 06.58 EDT\n\n, “We are a colony. That’s how we are treated.”, In 22 years on this island, Gordon Thomson, president of Christmas Island shire and head of the island’s workers’ union, has fought and lost too many battles with the commonwealth of Australia for diplomatic niceties., “The commonwealth is all-powerful on this island, and they are exerting all of their authority to run this operation,” he says of the latest incarnation of the island’s immigration detention centre, as a quarantine station for Australians evacuated from the global centre of the coronavirus, Wuhan in China., “The whole world is looking at Australia and seeing again that people are being incarcerated on Christmas Island. It’s a hysterical response, and it’s going to be ruinous to our tourist industry.”, Thomson may be firebrand in his rhetoric. But he is not alone in his sentiment. Through Christmas Islanders, runs a streak of independence., Born perhaps of a community forged in isolation, a colonial history that saw Malay and Chinese workers brought to work on British-run mines in the late 19th century, those who now live on Australia’s most remote inhabited territory have a keen sense of their own island identity, one keenly distinct from that on “the mainland”., CI has its own number plates, its own robber crab road signs, its own time zone., Ever-present here is a sense of being separate ... even separatist., The island itself rises imperiously from the waters of the Indian Ocean, sharp green hills of dramatic rock escarpment dripping in dense and unforgiving forest. Human settlement clings, almost apologetically, to the narrow edges. It is a land dominated by nature not by humankind., Hidden at the farthest point of the island is the Australian government’s immigration detention centre, repurposed this week as a quarantine facility, housing 270 Australian citizens and permanent residents who have been evacuated from Wuhan, in China’s central Hubei province, the centre of the global coronavirus epidemic. More could yet join., Before Thursday, the centre had fallen into something of a torpor: staffed by more than 100 people, it housed the loneliest asylum seekers in Australia’s arcane system: the Murugappan family – Nades, Priya and their Australian-born children Kopika and Tharunicaa – far from their home in Biloela, Queensland as they await a court hearing on the mainland., People are not happy about this. The Australian government just does whatever it wants to us., A surprising number of islanders tell Guardian Australia they’ve never been to or seen the centre, but, to the outside world, the immigration detention centre has become almost representative, almost definitional: the one thing that is known about Christmas Island., The immigration detention centre is absent from day-to-day life on Christmas Island, the remotest part of an already remote part of the world. But while the island and the centre are separate, they are almost inextricably bound., VIRUS ISLAND, the front page of the West Australian screamed in 100-point type the morning the first planeload of evacuees touched down. The reaction on Christmas Island was apoplectic. Local message boards lit up in furious response., “Very, very unfair,” a Malay woman who has lived for decades on Christmas Island, tells Guardian Australia, declining to give her name because of employment sensitivities., “Other people are angry that our island is being used for this. I don’t mind that the detention centre is being used: these people are Australian and we have got to help them. I’ve got children and I can imagine if my children were stuck there. But to make it sound like the whole island has coronavirus, that it’s all of us, hurts us. We love our island.”, At the Halal cafe in Flying Fish Cove, David Chan says the detention centre is, again, dominating life on Christmas Island., “Everyone on this island is talking about it. What should I do, should I be worried, do I need to be worried for my children? We don’t know., “People are not happy about this. The Australian government just does whatever it wants to us, it never asks us what we want.”, Chan stresses too that islanders are happy to help, to play their part in Australia’s response to the virus. He says the island bears no ill will to those brought here for quarantine (people of Chinese origin are the largest population group on Christmas Island). He just wishes the island had been asked., There is also a sense of yet further unthinking insensitivity. It is the tail end of the crab migration season here and hundreds of crabs remain on the roads. Islanders have been upset to find that convoys to the detention centre have run over up to half a dozen of the island’s famous robber crabs – far rarer than the red crabs and which are legally protected – and can live for up 80 years., But the disquiet over the latest imposition of federal government policy on the island community comes with a wearied resignation, a recognised powerlessness., “They have the power to do what they like, I just wish they would tell us, talk to us,” says Othman Dardak, a former councillor and member of the Islamic council of the island., “As Christmas Islanders, we have no voice in what happens to our own island, our own land.”, He says he worries for the reputation of the island, both in Australia and internationally. In the years following 2001, when immigration detention began on the island, the island was shorthand for Australia’s toxic political debate around asylum seekers and refugees: now it is known for the coronavirus., “We are all happy here, we are living a good life, but for people outside, all they know is detention centre and now coronavirus.”, Across the island, Guardian Australia is told there has been little communication from the federal government about what is happening on their island, and how concerned, if at all, they should be., A flyer posted at the Christmas Island recreation centre says “engagement with the Christmas Island community is an important part of planning” for the quarantine regime., “The government is focused on helping these Australians as quickly as possible … as Christmas Island residents, your support is greatly appreciated.”, The administrator of the island, former federal Liberal MP Natasha Griggs, has said in correspondence with the shire: “I understand the Christmas Island community is concerned about plans to establish coronavirus quarantine activities on island for Australians travelling from Wuhan/Hubei … please rest assured that the Christmas Island community will be provided updates and further information as it comes to hand.”, In previous incarnations of the detention centre – when it housed several hundred asylum seekers and others and its operation was fiercely controversial – former administrators held regular public meetings at the island’s tiny courthouse., That hasn’t happened this time. Local government is being excluded too, Thomson says., Usually, Christmas Island shire has responsibility for managing waste from the detention centre. When the shire inquired what it should do during the quarantine period, it was told simply waste would be “managed by the Department of Defence in line with guidance from the Department of Health”., But the anxiety over the coronavirus quarantine feeds, too, into a broader concern about the future of the island., Phosphate mining remains the major industry on the island – yellow and blue high-vis shirts dominate backs and clotheslines all over – but as production winds down, including a months-long shutdown last year and this, the industry counts its future in years, not decades., The question is being asked: “What next does this island do?”, Tourism is the obvious answer. The remote beauty of the island, its forests, snorkelling and the red crab migration, are all attractions, but the detention centre, hidden away at the end of the island, somehow looms large still., “For years this place was known as an island of incarceration. We were emerging from that and, while this is short-term and the reasons are different, again, all that people are hearing about Christmas Island is people being incarcerated again,” Thomson says., He argues Christmas Island is a non-self-governing territory and should be placed on the United Nations of those territories that have the right to a vote on independence., He believes there is significant support across the island for a “free association” with Australia, as the Marshall Islands does with the US, and Tokelau with New Zealand – a political arrangement which would give the island greater autonomy and control over its own land., “That way, we’d have a say in what happens here.”hysterical and ruinous christmas island faces its coronavirus moment", "label": 0}, "train-178": {"text": "\nAMP fined $5m for allowing financial advisers to rip off clients\n, Federal court ridicules company’s defence of just one ‘bad apple’, saying financial services group was ‘the right place’ for greed, \nBen Butler, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 20.04 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 20.10 EST\n\n, A federal court judge has blasted troubled financial services group AMP for allowing its commission-hungry financial advisers to systematically rip off clients, ridiculing the company’s defence that there was just one “bad apple” and fining it $5.175m., In a judgment handed down on Wednesday, Justice Michael Lee found AMP was “the right place” for greed and said it was arguable the penalty – which was more than Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) asked for – was “an inadequate reflection of the seriousness of the conduct” exposed in the case, but the law limited the fine he could impose., The Asic filed the lawsuit in June last year after the banking royal commission exposed AMP for allowing its planners to “churn” customers into new insurance policies when there was nothing wrong with the old one., By writing a new policy, instead of continuing the old one or arranging a transfer into a new one, the planners earned large commissions and put clients at a financial disadvantage., AMP initially admitted 40 clients might have been ripped off in this way but has subsequently identified an additional 626 clients who might have been exploited by their advisers, the court heard., Concerns were raised within AMP about the conduct of one planner, Rommel Panganiban, as early as December 2012., But no action was taken against him, and he even earned what Lee called a “remarkable” “green 4” rating, the second highest possible, during a routine audit in 2013., At another routine audit the following year, Panaganiban again earned the second-highest mark available, a “B”., “One might interrupt the narrative to remark that the mind boggles to envisage what one needed to do to get an ‘E’,” Lee said in his judgment., He was eventually sacked in September 2014., A panel made up of senior AMP executives decided that the company did not need to report the issue to Asic, and instead reported Panganiban to the regulator as a “bad apple”., This was “an exercise in damage control”, Lee said., “On the evidence before me, in the absence of a proper and thorough investigation, there was no basis, let alone a reasonable basis, for the idea to be conveyed to Asic that there was an isolated ‘bad apple’,” he said., Asic’s investigation uncovered five other planners who had done the same thing., Lee rejected AMP’s assertion it made a good faith effort to comply with its legal obligations., “Although there is no finding of dishonesty by those who should have taken prompt action, their insouciance is striking,” he said., When managers were warned of Panganiban’s behaviour, “one would have thought alarm bells would have rung (indeed bellowed); as it happens, the lack of an effective response is an illustration of how badly things had gone wrong within the organisation”, he said., “This was not a case of a ‘rogue’ falling through the narrow cracks of an otherwise well-built compliance system,” he said., “Panganiban, though undoubtedly a rogue, fell through holes in what may well have been an expensive, but was an inadequately operated compliance system., “Given Panganiban was evidently motivated by greed, he was in the right place.”, In addition to the fine, Lee found that AMP’s existing program to compensate such clients was inadequate and ordered it to undertake a new program, overseen by the court., He said the penalty handed down assumed AMP did this properly., “I will trust, but then verify,” he said., Asic permanently banned Panganiban from the financial services industry in September 2016.amp fined 5m for allowing financial advisers to rip off clients", "label": 0}, "train-179": {"text": "Morning mail: coronavirus fatalities rise, Biden fights back, farms on the climate frontline, \nMorning mail: coronavirus fatalities rise, Biden fights back, farms on the climate frontline\n, Monday: Toll climbs to 34 in Italy and 54 in Iran as expert warns worst-case scenario is likely.

We should get a few facts right first , Contact author, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 01.40 EST\n\n, As a child I often spent Saturday mornings in Melbourne’s Fitzroy Gardens., A highlight was always visiting a curious, somewhat magical place called “Captain Cook’s cottage”., From the time I was about four I knew who Captain Cook was because he’d “discovered” Australia. I think I was probably told that on the very first day of school. I also learned when I visited the little cottage with my primary school that Cook had lived in the cottage., He’d sometimes sort of lived in it, we were assured, back in the old country – England – in the intervals between his three voyages of discovery, during the first of which he “discovered” Australia and the last when the Hawaiians killed him for wearing out his welcome, cooked him and gave his bones back to the crew., I might’ve missed the part about him having sort-of maybe lived in the cottage only in England because, like so many Melbourne kids who didn’t self-start on Australian history until they were teenagers (or much later), I grew up for a while thinking he’d actually lived in it in Melbourne too. Why else would it be planted right there in the Fitzroy Gardens, so handy to the MCG (I had him pegged as a Melbourne supporter)? , It took me a long time to realise Cook, as it happened, never actually lived anywhere on the land in Australia, least of all in Melbourne. No. He preferred to stay on his ship the HM Endeavour. Except, of course, for those few times he did venture on to the actual land. That’s when he and his men tended to shoot those he called the “Indians” for doing stuff like gesturing for him to please just go away or “stealing” their turtles back from him and his men., There’re loads of experts on the divisive Cook (colonial bogeyman or hero?). Plenty will tell you he never actually held the title “captain” and that, if I’d bothered to check as a kid, I’d have discovered (just as he had Australia!) that the closest he actually came to the place that’s now Melbourne was from the deck of the Endeavour, a few kilometres off Tolywiarar, which he renamed Point Hicks, consistent with his predilection for bestowing from the sea English nomenclature upon places he’d never visit and which already had perfectly good Indigenous names. , Maps tells me that Tolywiarar is about 500km from Melbourne by road., That’s a long way. But not far enough to stop the Melbourne industrialist Russell Grimwade from buying the cottage when it went on sale in England and transporting it to Melbourne to mark the city’s 1934 centenary of foundation. Thus Captain Cook’s cottage became a miracle of history (in a country that would later deliberately ignore and overlook plenty more of its own) – a place with no connection whatsoever to Australia, yet for decades successfully miscast as some nationalistic colonial icon., The historian Linda Young points out in her paper The Contagious Magic of James Cook in Captain Cook’s Cottage that the Melbourne journalist and ex-navy type Hermon Gill was the key to all of this., Gill constructed a Cook–Melbourne connection, using the argument that the first Australian coastline observed by Cook’s 1770 expedition, now named Point Hicks in Gippsland, was in what had become the state of Victoria. Since Victoria’s capital, Melbourne, was about to mark 100 years of settlement, Gill suggested that Melbourne should become the ‘proud guardian of the one-time home of the man who had made the centenary possible, Captain James Cook’.”, It was an Olympic stretch of history. Yet one that endured through my childhood along with the Cook “discovery” myth (he was the first European to land on the continental east coast in April 1770)., One more critical thing about that little house in the gardens, later renamed “Cook’s cottage” to more accurately reflect established history. Cook never lived there. That Cook may have visited the cottage in Great Ayton, North Yorkshire – home to his parents, James and Grace, in their later years – is supposition. Historians have found no empirical evidence to support this proposition. There is no definite physical link between the great man and the building., A frenzy of commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Cook’s arrival is about to take place in Australia. Festivities include a $6.7m continental circumnavigation in the replica Endeavour (incidentally Cook never circumnavigated Australia) and $48m to update the Kurnell site (new visitor centre and another memorial) where Cook first set foot, his first act to shoot an Aboriginal man., There’ll be all sorts of hyperbole about Cook from his many prominent boosters, who include the prime minister, Scott Morrison – the member for Cook – who says of Cook’s arrival in 1770: “That voyage is the reason Australia is what it is today and it’s important we take the opportunity to reflect on it.”, Let the discussion begin., • Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistcaptain cooks cottage the place he didnt ever call home", "label": 0}, "train-182": {"text": "Australia welcomes US-Taliban agreement on Afghanistan troop withdrawal, Peace deal will see troops withdrawn from conflict in which 41 Australians, 2,500 Americans and more than 100,000 Afghans were killed, Australia has urged the Taliban to negotiate with the Afghan government “in good faith” as it welcomes the withdrawal of US forces from the war-ravaged country., The foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the defence minister, Linda Reynolds, issued a joint statement on Sunday welcoming the agreement signed between the United States and the Taliban that will see the 19-year presence of coalition forces come to an end., Forty-one Australians have been killed in the long-running conflict, along with more than 100,000 Afghanis and 2,500 Americans., About 400 Australian troops remain in the country., Payne said the government was pleased that the Afghan government and the US had agreed on next steps, including direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban on a permanent ceasefire., The agreement also includes measures to prevent international terrorist organisations including al-Qaida and Daesh from operating in Afghanistan., “Australia supports agreements and processes that aim to bring peace to Afghanistan after decades of conflict,” the statement said. “We call on the Taliban to continue to reduce violence and enter into negotiations with the Afghan government in good faith., “Terrorism will continue to present a threat to Afghanistan.

Around 4m dolphins are thought to have been caught as by-catch in tuna fishing nets since 1950. As many as 100,000 cetaceans – mainly dolphins – were caught in commercial gill nets as by-catch in 2006, with current annual numbers at about 80,000. Results from 10 programs counting by-catch between 1981 and 2016 – carried out in Australia, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan – were used to extrapolate how many cetaceans were caught across all Indian Ocean fisheries covering 24 countries. Co-author of the study, Dr Puti Liza Mustika, said the vast majority of those animals would die. “It’s a painful death. Dolphins are clever, but because the net is very thin in the water, the dolphins’ sonar misses them.”, Australia is heating more rapidly than the global average, with this past summer the second-hottest ever recorded. Temperatures were 1.88C above average and the Bureau of Meteorology estimates a 4C rise by 2100.

Temperatures this summer were above average across almost the entire country., Dr Blair Trewin, a senior climatologist with the bureau, said the hot summer, which was marked by the unprecedented bushfire crisis that devastated communities and wildlife in much of the country, was part of a long-term warming trend that had seen the country warm by 1.4C since 1910. Most of that warming has come since 1950., Trewin said: “That tells us the baseline is higher, and with that you have a higher risk of high extremes like we have seen in the past two summers. Our baseline expectation now is for warmer than average summers, and other seasons more generally.”, The heat records are relative to the long-term average for the years between 1961 and 1990., The bureau’s summer report came as its officials told a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra that Australia is heating more rapidly than the global average., Karl Braganza, the head of climate monitoring, was asked how much Australia was projected to warm, given a scientific analysis involving the World Meteorological Organisation last year found average global temperatures were expected to rise between 2.9C and 3.4C by 2100 under commitments put forward by national governments as part of the Paris agreement., Braganza said the increase in Australia would be expected to be “closer to 4C” heating than the global average under that scenario, assuming countries did not do more than promised in Paris., Adam Bandt, the Greens leader, said the government was undertaking no planning for the possibility of 4C warming in Australia. “Australia saw this horrific bushfire season with just over one degree of warming. We’re hurtling towards 4C and it’s only going to get worse from here,” he said., This summer saw many more heat records broken than cool records. The bureau data shows 43 sites in NSW broke high temperature records but only five sites saw record lows. In Queensland, there were 10 heat records broken across different monitoring stations, but only one record for cool weather., The 2018-19 summer also saw below average rainfall across the country, with western NSW, south-western Queensland and the Top End particularly dry. Some areas, including Western Australia’s west coast, and parts of the east coast, saw above average rainfall., The second hottest summer comes after the bureau declared 2019  the hottest and driest year on record., Trewin said the summer could be characterised as a season “of two halves”., “We had December and the first few days of January, which was extremely hot almost nationwide, and extremely dry. Those heat extremes in December and early January were quite exceptional,” he said., That exceptional heat included 17 and 18 December, when on two consecutive days Australia recorded its hottest day on record. The national average temperature on 18 December was 41.9C – one whole degree hotter than the previous day., December 2019 also delivered the worst conditions for bushfires on a record going back to 1950., Several records were broken for warmest summer nights in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. On 1 February, nighttime temperatures in the rural area of Condobolin, west of Dubbo, NSW, did not drop below 34.7C., Aside from climate change, there were natural drivers of the heat in the early part of the summer. Trewin said in December and early January, the weather patterns were influenced by a strong Indian Ocean Dipole that had dragged moisture away from the continent and a “strongly negative Southern Annular Mode”., But as both these systems moved into a neutral phase, the rest of January and February was less extreme., Rainfall for January and February was slightly above average, Trewin said, but the extreme dry of December meant that across the three months rainfall was below average., But 10 February still delivered record rainfall for some parts of NSW. At Taralga, 100km west of Wollongong, the town had its wettest summer day on record with 197mm beating the previous record of 130mm, set in 1885., While the bureau’s report does not cover ocean temperatures, the hot summer has also seen the build-up of heat stress on the Great Barrier Reef, with scientists fearing a third mass coral bleaching event in the past five years if temperatures don’t fall in the next few days.summer of 2019 20 second hottest australian summer on record", "label": 0}, "train-186": {"text": "\nScott Morrison’s one-man cabinet committee an ‘abuse of process’, Labor says\n, PM has dismissed opposition’s concerns but Penny Wong says it could be used to ‘cover up decision-making’, \nPaul Karp, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 02.28 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 03.45 EST\n\n, Labor has labelled a cabinet committee with just one permanent member – Scott Morrison – an “abuse of process” that enables Morrison to call meetings protected by cabinet confidentiality, even if no other cabinet members are present., The cabinet office policy committee was the focus of questioning in both Senate estimates and question time, where Morrison defended the committee responsible for his policy “deep dives” and dismissed Labor concerns as “trivial Canberra politics”., On Monday, Mathias Cormann and officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet confirmed that Morrison was the only “permanent” member of the committee., Stephanie Foster, the PMC deputy secretary of governance, told the finance and public administration estimates hearing that Morrison convenes meetings attended by others. Cormann said this included ministers, backbenchers and public servants, but took on notice if it included non-government stakeholders., Foster and Cormann suggested the committee informs the government’s policy direction including commissioning further work, but decisions are ultimately taken by the expenditure review committee or cabinet itself., Wong suggested that meetings of the cabinet committee would be protected by cabinet confidentiality, even if no other cabinet members are present and non-parliamentarians are, labelling this an “abuse of cabinet in confidence”., An answer to a question on notice confirmed as a committee of cabinet, the cabinet office policy committee would attract the “longstanding rule” against disclosing information that “could potentially reveal the deliberations of cabinet”., “You use these conventions to cover up blatant political decision-making,” Wong said. “It’s yet another Morrison government cover-up.”, Asked if material considered would be protected by cabinet confidentiality, Cormann replied the meetings are “discussions” that may not have formal decision minutes but took the question on notice., Cormann argued the committee is part of “good public policy development” to get the “broadest possible input” to government decision-making, accusing Labor’s Penny Wong of “confected outrage” about the workings of the committee., “Nothing about anything you’ve raised is concerning,” he said., Officials took on notice a request for the dates the committee had met, and whether members of the political wing of the Liberal party had attended., Asked in question time if the “one-man committee” constituted an abuse of the cabinet designed to hide government documents, Morrison replied: “I can confirm that the governance committee of cabinet regularly has attending its meetings myself, the attorney general, the deputy prime minister and the treasurer.”, Morrison mistook the question to be about the cabinet’s governance committee, which is constituted by himself, Christian Porter, Michael McCormack and Josh Frydenberg., In response to a further question, Morrison defended the cabinet office policy committee which he said meets “on a regular basis to focus on key challenges and issues facing the Australian people”., Morrison said as the “convenor” of the committee he brings in cabinet members, and other members of the government., “The policy committee has been dealing with issues like getting electricity prices down, dealing with the issues of how we manage plastics waste, ensuring how we can get focused on the energy needs of Australia into the future, how with can focus on meeting the damage and challenges of the drought,” he said., “These cabinet office policy committees have been crucial mechanisms used for the government to come together, to pull together the experience and the learnings and the wisdom of those who sit on the government benches to focus on the issues that are most important to the Australian people.”, “And what the Australian people are getting a lesson from, from the opposition at the moment, is they are more interested in the trivial politics of Canberra than the serious issues that are confronting the Australian people.”, In a statement, Labor’s shadow cabinet secretary, Jenny McAllister, said the committee “is both a device for internal control and a vehicle to shield documents from parliamentary scrutiny and freedom of information laws”. “We know Mr Morrison doesn’t trust his cabinet colleagues, and his one-person cabinet committee proves it.”, Guardian Australia contacted Morrison for comment.scott morrisons one man cabinet committee an abuse of process labor says", "label": 0}, "train-187": {"text": "\nLiberal senator tells Asio chief his use of term ‘rightwing’ can offend conservatives\n, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells confronts security head during Senate estimates over saying ‘right’ when talking about extremists, \nChristopher Knaus, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 01.54 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 02.00 EST\n\n, Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells has attacked Australia’s domestic intelligence chief for using the term “rightwing” while warning of the growing threat of rightwing extremism, saying it offended conservatives., The head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), Mike Burgess, warned last week of the significant and growing threat of the ‘“extreme rightwing” in Australia, describing small cells meeting to salute Nazi flags, train in combat and spread hate., The speech deliberately and repeatedly used the descriptors of “extreme rightwing” and “extremist rightwing”, differentiating the threat from mainstream politics., But the comments appear to have caused offence among some sections of the Liberal party. Fierravanti-Wells confronted Burgess during a Senate estimates hearing on Monday, complaining of the use of the word “right”.She said: “I am concerned about this and concerned about the use of terminology of ‘right’. ‘Right’ is associated with conservatism in this country and there are many people of conservative background who take exception with being charred sic with the same brush., “I think that you do understand that your comments, particularly when you refer to them solely as ‘rightwing’, has the potential to offend a lot of Australians.”, Fierravanti-Wells sought to characterise some rightwing extremists as actually being of the left, while simultaneously saying “it doesn’t really matter what spectrum they’re on”., “I think you would equally agree that there have been instances in this country where there have been so-called rightwing extremists protesting with flags that denominate, whether it’s the BLF flag or other flags, have indicated their politics are not actually rightwing, they were actually leftwing,” she said., “So I think the time has come, director general, especially for you, to ensure that the terminology that you use is very careful and so that ordinary Australians, particularly those of conservative background, are not offended.”, Burgess said he had never intended to offend anyone., “I totally get it and my intention was not to offend any innocent people in that regard,” the intelligence chief said. “As I say, it’s unfortunate that we refer to it as rightwing extremism, but in the absence of anything else … maybe we should consider another label.”, The matter was raised in parliament last week by Labor’s Josh Burns, who warned that the actions of mainstream political parties mattered in encouraging extremist ideologies., “Our words and our actions as members of parliament matter,” Burns said. “The leadership we show or fail to show matters. The far right is an extremist ideology that breeds, and feeds off, hatred of Jews, Muslims and others of all sorts of racial and ethnic-minority backgrounds.”, Immediately after Burgess’s speech, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, raised concerns about extremism of the “far left” and “far right”., “If somebody is going to cause harm to Australians, I just don’t care whether they’re on the far right, far left, somewhere in between, they will be dealt with,” he said. “And if the proliferation of information into the hands of rightwing lunatics or leftwing lunatics is leading to a threat in our country, then my responsibility is to make sure our agencies are dealing with it, and they are.”, Burgess raised no concerns about the far left in his speech. liberal senator tells asio chief his use of term rightwing can offend conservatives", "label": 0}, "train-188": {"text": "Labor presses officials over sports grants scandal – as it happened, Penny Wong raises questions about possible breaches of ministerial standards.

Megan Davis gave us the roadmap for significant reform that empowers Aboriginal people and communities to change this system for the better.”, In response, the NSW government said it is committed to providing permanency for children in out-of-home care., “The recommendations of the Family Is Culture report will be considered carefully and in their entirety. The Department of Communities and Justice is preparing preliminary advice in relation to the recommendations, which is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2020,” a spokesman for the NSW families minister Gareth Ward said.indigenous and welfare groups urge nsw to take urgent action on child protection", "label": 0}, "train-190": {"text": "\nJacinda Ardern brushes off criticism from Peter Dutton on deportation stance\n, Australia’s home affairs minister had linked New Zealand prime minister’s comments to her upcoming re-election bid, Australian Associated Press, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 23.45 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Sun 1 Mar 2020 20.59 EST\n\n, New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has brushed off criticism from Australia’s home affairs minister Peter Dutton, saying his policy decisions are “regrettable”., At her weekly news conference in Wellington on Monday, Ardern was scathing about Dutton’s criticism of her recent meeting with Scott Morrison, saying it was not her plain-talking that was to blame for increasing tensions between the neighbours – but Australia’s policy decisions on immigration matters which were hurting Kiwis., “I’d describe his policy as regrettable. More than that, I’d describe it as corrosive and I have for well over a year,” Ardern said., “I’ve been raising this consistently with every Australian prime minister I’ve met with and I will continue to do so.”, “I wouldn’t describe it as a swipe. I would describe it as defence of New Zealand’s position, defence of New Zealand’s principled position on this issue … yes this is testing our relationship, and when it comes to politics that is where we’re being tested.”, Earlier on Monday, Dutton rebuked Ardern for challenging Australia’s controversial deportation laws during a bilateral meeting with the Australian prime minister in Sydney last week., Ardern used a media conference alongside Morrison to attack the policy of deporting New Zealand citizens, no matter how long they had spent in Australia, if they had committed a crime., “Do not deport your people and your problems,” she said., Dutton described her comments as “regrettable” but he did not resile from the policy., “New Zealand obviously is in an electoral cycle at the moment,” he told Sky News on Monday., “It is, I think, regrettable that she made the comments but that would have played well domestically for her.”, Australia’s policy of deporting foreign-born criminals has placed deep strain on trans-Tasman relations for several years., “I think for Australia we act in our national interest and her job is to act in the national interest of New Zealanders, so I don’t think there is any surprise there,” Dutton said., “But I don’t have any regrets about the numbers of visas we’ve cancelled, particularly the people who have committed sexual offences against women and children.”, Ardern raised the example of a woman who had left New Zealand at the age of one but had been deported from Australia., Morrison said last week Australia had no plans to abandon the policy. “The Australian government’s policy is very clear,” he said.peter dutton rebukes jacinda ardern for regrettable deportation comments", "label": 0}, "train-191": {"text": "Doctored documents saga: Angus Taylor says the 'matter is closed', Earlier on Monday, federal police commissioner Reece Kershaw was forced to defend decision not to investigate , Angus Taylor has declared he is moving on from the controversy sparked by his erroneous attack on the City of Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore because “two independent police forces” have examined the issues and the Australian federal police says the investigation is over., After the AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, told a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra the decision not to investigate allegations against Taylor was considered and objective, and the case would not be re-opened, Taylor said it was time to move on., “We’ve had two independent police forces look at this … I’ve cooperated with them at each stage,” Taylor told the ABC on Monday night. “They have both considered and closed this matter, and the AFP commissioner said today the matter is finalised, full stop”., “I’m getting on with my job”., Kershaw faced sustained questioning at Senate estimates on Monday about what the AFP did to investigate allegations Taylor relied on a falsified document to launch an attack on City of Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore about her travel-related carbon emissions., The AFP decided last month not to investigate the matter because it had “determined it is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence”., It had previously emerged that police did not interview Taylor or Moore before dropping the investigation., The Greens senator Nick McKim asked Kershaw why his officers didn’t simply pick up the phone and ask Taylor about the allegations, given his signature was on a document containing false information., Kershaw said the AFP does not “operate like that”., He also ruled out any prospect of re-opening the investigation, saying:, “The matter is finalised – full stop.”, Kershaw was unable to immediately answer a series of questions from Labor senator Kristina Keneally about what steps police took to test Taylor’s claim that he downloaded the erroneous information from an annual report on the City of Sydney website., Taylor says he downloaded the erroneous document in early September before providing it to the Daily Telegraph, which subsequently ran a piece attacking Moore’s travel expenditure and associated emissions., Keneally asked whether police had examined Google Analytics, showing that the annual report in question was only downloaded 13 times in the four-day window relevant to Taylor’s defence. She asked whether police had accessed City of Sydney metadata, interviewed the council’s staff, Daily Telegraph journalists, environment department officials or anyone from Taylor’s office, or Josh Manuatu, a former Taylor staffer., Kershaw took all of those questions on notice., The questioning at times prompted outrage from Liberal senators. McKim suggested the AFP was running a “protection racket” for Taylor, a comment described by Liberal senator Sarah Henderson as “appalling”., Keneally asked the AFP whether its investigations had considered the possibility that Taylor’s wife, Louise Clegg, planned to run for the City of Sydney lord mayorship., “I think it’s quite relevant,” Keneally responded when her questioning drew condemnation. “We have a federal minister who used a doctored document to attack not only his political rival in terms of policy terms, but also potentially his wife’s rival in political terms.”, “The police have decided to discontinue the investigation, not to proceed to an investigation, it’s well within my rights to ask these questions.”, Clegg said the claim was completely false and she had no intention of running for the position., “I am not running, have never planned to run and am ineligible to run for the position of Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney Council,” she said., “This is an attack on a member of parliament’s family for political purposes.”, Kershaw said the decision not to investigate was partly shaped by a recent review of the AFP’s handling of sensitive matters, conducted by John Lawler., That review was launched in the wake of the raids on the ABC and recommended that the AFP consider the level of harm in potential allegations before deciding whether to investigate., The AFP deputy commissioner, Ian McCartney, has previously described the Taylor matter as presenting a “low level of ongoing harm”., Kershaw said operational priorities and resourcing were also factors in the decision, as was Taylor’s apology to Moore., Keneally asked how the AFP could determine the level of harm without having interviewed Moore, the victim., “How do you make a determination of harm and a decision not to continue to an investigation without speaking to the victim?”, Kershaw said the decision was objective and considered, and backed the officers and oversight team responsible., • This article was amended on 3 March 2020. A previous version suggested Kristina Keneally asked the AFP whether it had considered the fact that Louise Clegg planned to run for City of Sydney lord mayor.

In 2018-19 the old cart sold 85,000 coffees and collected $330,000 in revenue, although Stefanic noted that year’s results might have been down because of the federal election., “The current estimates for sales would put that well over 100,000 for this financial year, based on forecasts,” he said., Liberal senator Paul Scarr congratulated the department on an “extraordinarily good result, on any objective basis”., In 2017 department officials were forced to defend a proposed 70% rent hike for Aussies from $87,000 to $150,000 a year., Officials told Senate Estimates the proposed increase resulted from the cafe’s licence not having been market tested in 25 years and encouragement from the audit office to maximise the return to the Commonwealth.coffee cart upgrade at parliament house cost taxpayers almost 400000", "label": 0}, "train-194": {"text": "Australia knew of dangers facing murdered Balibo Five journalists, book says, Bernard Collaery says he ‘felt so sick’ after reading former British ambassador’s account of Australian intelligence, Lawyer Bernard Collaery says Australia had direct knowledge of the dangers facing the murdered Balibo Five journalists, citing a damning report suggesting Australian intelligence knew Indonesia viewed reporters as a “hurdle to be got over” in keeping its invasion of East Timor secret., Collaery has published his long-awaited book Oil Under Troubled Water, a forensic account of Australia’s relationship with its tiny developing neighbour, Timor-Leste. The lawyer describes the relationship as a “tortuous” and “grim” tale of exploitation, missed opportunity, culpability and complicity., The book’s release comes amid Australian government threats and the criminal prosecution of Collaery for his role in exposing the bugging of Timor-Leste’s government offices during sensitive oil and gas negotiations., Collaery’s book treads carefully around the criminal proceedings he faces for legal reasons. But it raises renewed questions about what Australia’s foreign intelligence service knew of the dangers to five journalists murdered by Indonesian forces in Balibo in the lead-up to the invasion of then Portuguese Timor in 1975., Collaery quotes a secret assessment from the then British ambassador to Indonesia John Ford that points to high-level and immediate intelligence sharing between Australia and Indonesia’s intelligence service, then known as Bakin, in 1975., Ford’s report described information obtained by “the Australians” showing they had knowledge of “clandestine activity” by Indonesian troops in East Timor in the lead-up to the invasion. It said Indonesia’s principal fear was that their activities in Timor would be exposed., “A particular hurdle to be got over is a plane load of Australian journalists and politicians who are due to visit Timor, apparently at Fretilin request, to investigate allegations of Indonesian intervention,” Ford said in his 1975 report. “The information from the Australians is sensitive and should not be played back to them or repeated to other missions.”, The Australian Secret Intelligence Service has fought to keep records on Indonesia’s occupation secret, though the report quoted in Collaery’s book has previously been unearthed by the British researcher Hugh Dowson., Collaery said he had found Ford’s report almost by accident while searching through the UK National Archives., “While writing the book in Cambridge, I spent a great deal of time at the royal archives,” Collaery told the Guardian., “Much of the unrevealed Australian record was there, and it was challenging to read. But when I found ambassador Ford’s letter, merely by chance, I got up and went out to the canteen and had a cup of tea, I felt so sick. I felt so sick. I’d assisted Balibo widow Shirley Shackleton with Balibo victim Greg Shackleton’s estate and I knew the families, and I couldn’t believe it.”, Clinton Fernandes, a leading expert on Timor-Leste who has fought Asis to release Balibo records, said the Ford report was “striking” because it hinted Australia’s foreign spy agency “knew more than has previously been admitted”., “Indonesian operatives in the 1970s viewed massacres and assassinations as normal modes of behaviour,” Fernandes told the Guardian. “If the journalists were ‘a hurdle to be overcome’ then their fates were sealed even before they landed in Timor, and Asis knew it.”, In his book, Collaery said there “seemed little doubt” the journalists’ lives could have been saved if Australia had directly warned Indonesian leaders., “It is for any inquiry to determine whether those dealing with Bakin knew the news team was headed to Balibo and shared that knowledge,” he said., He also expressed surprise that Australia, given its knowledge, did not warn journalists of the threat they faced in Timor., “Given the history of Indonesia’s ruthless suppression of media dissent at home and in West Papua, it is surprising that Australia and Britain did not give more direct warnings to the media contingents that continued to arrive at Dili in September and early October 1975 in a blaze of publicity about alleged clandestine Indonesian military activity,” Collaery wrote., “More damning, given the top-level intelligence liaison between Australia and Indonesia revealed by Ambassador Ford, is the apparent failure to warn Indonesian intelligence chief Lt General Yoga Sugama of the anticipated fallout were state-sponsored harm to befall foreign journalists., “Clearly the intelligence relationship, at least between Australia and Bakin, was robust enough for such a démarche.”, Oil Under Troubled Water is published by Melbourne University Press.australia knew of dangers facing murdered balibo five journalists book says", "label": 0}, "train-195": {"text": "Morning mail: virus spreads among Iran MPs, Super Tuesday under way, US slashes rates, \nMorning mail: virus spreads among Iran MPs, Super Tuesday under way, US slashes rates\n, Wednesday: about 8% of the Iranian parliament’s MPs have tested positive for the coronavirus.

The worst-case scenario is also the loss of about 1,800 local jobs., Of all Australian destinations, Cairns and far north Queensland face a unique risk. The area is heavily reliant on the usual stream of Asian visitors coming to see the Great Barrier Reef and the tropical rainforests. Because Cairns is remote, it cannot pivot as quickly or easily to attract more domestic travellers., The chief executive of Tropical North Queensland Tourism, Mark Olsen, said the industry had “never faced a tougher time” in Cairns and the reef. “There will be long-term effects. Even coming in to 2020 … we’ve seen a significant reduction in our air-seat capacity and the bushfire crisis driving down visitation from long-haul markets.”, Johnson said tourism markets were now reliant on domestic travellers to keep businesses afloat. “There is some fairly good discounting going on. Domestic travel is what will effectively get us through this crisis,” he said. “These hotels really do need Australians to support them and get up there and have a holiday.”, He said governments would ultimately have to provide an assistance package for businesses in such “exceptional times”., The prime minister told reporters on Tuesday the government was developing a targeted, measured and scalable economic response plan., “The Treasury is working closely together with the other relevant agencies of government to address the boost that we believe will be necessary, which I will have more to say about once we have worked through the details of that plan,” Scott Morrison said. “It will be targeted on the real diagnosis of the economic issue we are looking to confront here., “We will ensure that we do not make the same mistakes of previous stimulus measures that have been put in place.

At the bottom of it, it calculated the total overpayment., “It was something completely different to what I’d asked for. And somebody else’s details.”, Reid told Guardian Australia that he was concerned that this meant his own information had been sent to another welfare recipient., He has contacted Services Australia about the privacy breach and said he was told to bring the documents into a Centrelink shopfront to have them destroyed, or to do so himself., It comes amid a huge increase in the number of privacy breaches by the agency. Services Australia’s last annual report showed there was a 43% jump in substantiated privacy incidents, from 988 in 2017-18 to 1,416 in 2018-19. Since 2012-13, the number of incidents has increased by 200%, although there was a brief spike in 2014–15 when the agency recorded 1,939 breaches., The agency told Senate estimates recently that these incidents occurred across the whole department, not just Centrelink., Hank Jongen, a spokesman for Services Australia, said the agency took “the protection of personal information very seriously and apologise for any inconvenience”., “We take immediate action to address a privacy incident as soon as it is identified, including taking available measures to remediate the incident and minimise any harm that may arise from it,” he said., “We also undertake regular quality assurance and training activities to reduce the likelihood of privacy incidents occurring. This can include feedback and training to staff involved, increased guidance for all staff, and process and system improvements.”, Asked about the huge increase in privacy incidents last financial year, Jongen said the agency had 980m interactions with individuals in 2018-19 and that “privacy incidents represent a very small proportion of our overall interactions”., “The number of substantiated privacy incidents includes some incidents that we proactively identified as part of our data quality processes and subsequently corrected before they had any impact on customers.”, Citing an investigation into the breach, Jongen declined to comment on whether Reid’s personal information had also been inadvertently shared, nor whether the agency had contacted the person whose data had been accidentally sent to Reid.centrelink accidentally sends pensioners personal information to wrong man", "label": 0}, "train-200": {"text": "\nStuart Robert corrects interests register over $10,000 bowls club grant\n, NDIS and government services minister handed $9,725 novelty cheque to Paradise Point bowls club in his electorate in the lead-up to 2019 election , \nChristopher Knaus and \nNick Evershed, \n\nTue 3 Mar 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 3 Mar 2020 20.11 EST\n\n, Stuart Robert has failed to declare ongoing links to a Gold Coast bowls club that he previously handed a $9,725 novelty cheque to in the lead-up to the election., The NDIS and government services minister filmed himself handing over the giant cheque to the Paradise Point bowls club in his electorate of Fadden in February and distributed the video on social media., The money was awarded for new maintenance equipment through the Stronger Communities program, a scheme that gives local MPs some influence over the process., Robert has formal links to the Paradise Point men’s bowls club. He is its honorary patron and held the position at the time the government deliberated on the grant and awarded it., At the time the grant was awarded, Robert had properly and appropriately declared his patronage of the club to parliament., But he has failed to disclose his ongoing patronage since at least July last year., Robert promised to update the register after questions from the Guardian, saying he had “now updated the honorary patronage” on his register of interests., A spokesman said Robert had disclosed his links properly as required at the time the “grant was independently assessed and recommended by a community committee”. The Guardian is not suggesting otherwise., The spokesman also denied suggestions of a conflict between Robert’s role as club patron, his handing over of the $9,725 novelty cheque, and the role the Stronger Communities program gives him in inviting eligible organisations within his electorate to apply., The spokesman said Robert had invited all community organisations in his electorate to apply for a Stronger Communities grant but had no role in assessing applications., He said he simply acted on the recommendations of an independent community committee that conducted the assessments., Robert did, however, confirm he had established that committee., “As per the program guidelines, Mr Robert established an independent community committee of Fadden community representatives who assess and make recommendations for grants under the program,” the spokesman said., “Mr Robert is not involved in the assessment process and acts on recommendations of the independent community committee.”, The spokesman said committee members adhered to conflict of interest guidelines and recused themselves when necessary., He also sought to distinguish Robert’s role as patron of the Paradise Point men’s bowls club and the grant application by a separate entity, the Paradise Point bowls club, for which he “does not have a financial or honorary membership”., It is not the first time Robert has courted controversy for failing to declare interests to parliament., In October last year he got into strife after he failed to declare his interest in a bodybuilding supplements business for four months., The Stronger Communities grant program works by giving each of the 151 federal electorates $150,000 to fund small capital projects worth up to $20,000., Applicants must be invited to apply by their local MP. All others are shut out of the process., The local MP also establishes the committee that then considers the applications., Recommendations are then made to the department about who should receive money. Guidelines urge both applicants and MPs to take steps to declare and avoid conflicts of interest, including any “professional, commercial or personal relationship with a party who is able to influence the application selection process”., The Paradise Point bowls club did not respond to an email request for comment.stuart robert declared link to local bowls club in 2018 but not his continuing patronage after grant", "label": 0}, "train-201": {"text": "\nScott Morrison wants the nation to trust him – but how can we after sports rorts?\n, The prime minister has presented himself and his office as bystanders, but all the evidence points to their deep involvement , Contact author, \n\nTue 3 Mar 2020 03.15 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 3 Mar 2020 20.01 EST\n\n, Given the intricacies of the sports rorts controversy can be bamboozling, let’s keep this really simple., Scott Morrison has spent the weeks since the Australian National Audit Office completely eviscerated his government’s administration of the $100m sports grants program presenting himself and his office as a bunch of breezy feedback brokers, just lurking about periodically to give the sport minister a hand., In this version of events, while the former sport minister Bridget McKenzie lined up the various grants to be rolled out during last year’s election on the now infamous colour-coded spreadsheets – compiling and adjusting the list of projects she proposed to fund, summarised by state, political party and electorate – the prime minister’s office, by Morrison’s account, just passed on various representations from MPs., Caring and sharing. As you do., The prime minister’s office was a redirection service, periodically passing on the hopes and dreams of colleagues, and their plucky sports clubs, to Bridget, so Bridget could decide, because she was the decider., But the facts tell a different story., The ANAO has revealed that between 17 October 2018 and 11 April 2019 McKenzie and Morrison’s office exchanged 136 emails about the program. Now perhaps this level of traffic is consistent in some universe with hands-off caring and sharing, but, objectively, this is quite a lot of caring and sharing., It suggests more than a passing interest. It suggests active coordination., Then we have the inconvenience of records in the hands of the auditor indicating the prime minister’s office actually made things happen. I’ll let Brian Boyd from the ANAO take up the story., Boyd told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday night McKenzie “maintained the spreadsheet at all times”, but there was a lot of incoming. Sometimes, Boyd said, the prime minister’s office made representations, “but not all of those representations led to a change”., But at other times those “representations” led to concrete outcomes. “For example, when I referred to one project coming out and one project coming in, in terms of the 8.46am version, that was at the request of the prime minister’s office”., Let’s repeat that last bit. At the request of the prime minister’s office. Translation: pull this, and insert that, hey presto!, Obviously this is more than representations, take it or leave it., It is curious if you are Scott Morrison and you choose to reveal the first, the representations, while omitting the second, the outcomes you engineer, when the second component is actually more material., Morrison’s whole purpose in constructing his “we were just the freight-forwarders” defence is that he and his office were hands off, that this was all Bridget. Let’s call this strategy what it is: inoculation. Fire wall construction., The trouble for Morrison is every new piece of evidence that emerges tells us this wasn’t all Bridget. This wasn’t even close to being all Bridget. But only Bridget has lost her frontbench spot, and that was on a technicality., It’s a strange sort of universe where there is a clear documentary trail suggestive of significant alternative facts, but only Bridget faces practical consequences for suboptimal actions, and everyone else gets a self-conferred free pass., And when I say strange, I mean unfair. I mean wrong. I mean not even close to good enough., As well as consequences for actions apparently being arbitrary, the sports grants controversy has also unearthed cameos suggestive of a government that is entirely fast and loose with process and convention., From where I sit, this is deeply worrying. The most worrying thing about it is the complete absence of contrition, and the recurrent tetchy suggestions from Morrison that anyone who dares to call out the fast and loose tendencies is a nit-picker, or a partisan, or a bubble occupant., A bit like when the prime minister tried to brush off inconvenient questions about whether he tried to get the Hillsong pastor Brian Houston along to a state dinner at the White House as “gossip” and a bubble fixation, before abruptly confirming this had been true all along. Disconcerting – the short runway between gossip and fact., This column isn’t a piece of advocacy for McKenzie. I’m quite certain she can look after herself., I recount these facts to make another point, and the point is about trust. Trust matters. Trust is the glue that holds democracies together., Morrison asks for trust every day that he stands up and speaks to the nation about managing the coronavirus., The prime minister asks to be believed. He asks people to listen, to follow advice. Implicit in this pitch is words, advice, pronouncements, from the holder of his high office, carry meaning, and they are consistent with facts and evidence., Being believed, being trusted, is an antidote to pervasive disinformation, and cheap jack demagoguery. It is, in fact, the best antidote we have to these things., But “trust me, I’m the prime minister” doesn’t work if you then behave in a manner entirely inconsistent with your own request., So here’s the rub, prime minister. Being truthful isn’t a cause of convenience.

While the use of such a power may be necessary to limit the spread of potentially dangerous infectious diseases, the threshold for determining a LHD and then for imposing a control order needs to be carefully considered to ensure it achieves this purpose based on reasonable grounds., Updated\nat 12.39am EST\naustralia detained coronavirus biosecurity laws australian prime minister scott morrison update news politics live", "label": 0}, "train-203": {"text": "\nScott Morrison confirms he sought White House invite for Hillsong pastor Brian Houston\n, The prime minister has refused for months to answer questions from journalists and Labor, describing the story as ‘gossip’, \nSarah Martin Chief political correspondent, \n\nTue 3 Mar 2020 01.29 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 3 Mar 2020 04.02 EST\n\n, The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has finally confirmed that he asked the Trump administration to invite the Hillsong pastor Brian Houston to a state dinner at the White House, after refusing for months to answer the question and deriding the story as “gossip”., Speaking on 2GB radio on Tuesday, Morrison said that he had known the Hillsong leader for “a long time” and had included his name on a list of potential guests that was ultimately decided by the White House., “On that occasion, we put forward a number of names that included Brian, but not everybody whose names we put forward were invited,” Morrison said., “I’ve known Brian for a long time and Hillsong church has a very big network of churches all across the United States, and the ministry, when it comes to the music and so many other things have been very big – it’s probably the single largest church organisation that is known in the United States., The 2GB presenter Ben Fordham said the question about the invitation was relevant because Houston remained under police investigation., According to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, Houston failed to alert the police to allegations his father had sexually assaulted children, and had a conflict of interest when he assumed responsibility for dealing with the accusations., Fordham asked Morrison if he had been aware of the investigation., “All I know is that they’re a very large and very well-attended and well-supported organisation here in Australia, and, you know, they’re very well known in the United States, so well known that Brian was actually at the White House a few months after I was, so the president obviously didn’t have an issue with it, and that’s what I think that’s where the matter rests,” Morrison said., “But honestly people chased this round and round for months and what’s important is the relationship we have with the United States and it’s never been better.”, The request from the prime minister’s office for Houston’s attendance was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in September while Morrison was in Washington DC for a state visit. The report said that Morrison had been “determined” to invite Houston, but after several rounds of discussions between Canberra and Washington the idea was vetoed by the White House., When asked by the travelling Australian media about the report, Morrison refused to answer questions, saying: “I don’t comment on gossip or stories about other stories.”, On Tuesday Morrison said he had refused to answer questions about Houston at the time because he did “not want to be distracted by it”., “Honestly, at the end of the day, it was not a significant matter and people have not asked me about it for months and months and more,” he told ABC’s 730. “A journalist asked me about it today and I answered it straight up.”, On his return to Australia from the US trip, Morrison continued to evade the issuing by saying there were “rather aggressive statements” being made about Houston and again refused to confirm the report., “I’m not going to go into the habit of just because one journalist somewhere in the world talks to someone who won’t put their name to it, and all of a sudden apparently we’ve got to play 20 questions. That’s just not how I’m going to operate. If people have an established source who’s prepared to put their names to things, well that’s a different matter,” Morrison told Sky News., Labor also attempted to question Morrison about the guest list in parliament, prompting him to accuse Labor of casting aspersions on Houston., “If they are suggesting anything serious, or casting any aspersions on the individual which is the subject of the question, then perhaps I suggest they go and attend that church and they explain their concerns directly to their parishioners,” Morrison said., Morrison has credited Houston as being a key spiritual mentor, naming him in his first speech to parliament in 2008., “Growing up in a Christian home, I made a commitment to my faith at an early age and have been greatly assisted by the pastoral work of many dedicated church leaders, in particular the Reverend Ray Green and pastors Brian Houston and Leigh Coleman,” Morrison said., The Morrison family are regular churchgoers, and attended the opening session of the Hillsong annual conference shortly after the May federal election, where Morrison called for more love and more prayer to embody “the amazing love of God”.scott morrison confirms he sought white house invite for hillsong pastor brian houston", "label": 0}, "train-204": {"text": "More than 20 Aboriginal Australians may be in detention after high court rules they can't be deported, Senate committee hears second Aboriginal man released and 23 cases ‘under review’, A second Aboriginal man has been released from immigration detention and another 23 cases are “under review” after the high court decision that Aboriginal people are not aliens for the purpose of the constitution and cannot be deported., “We are working through the cases that might fall within that remit,” the home affairs department secretary, Mike Pezzullo, told a Senate committee on Monday., “A number of persons have come forward and advised on potential claims” and the department is “working on it as quickly as possible”., There is a three-part definition of Aboriginality accepted by the high court in the Mabo cases: biological descent, self-identification and recognition of identity by a First Nations group.

He had also pleaded guilty, made admissions to police, had an otherwise good character, and experienced disadvantage during his upbringing., Todd has also been diagnosed with a mild form of autism and has been in protective custody since his arrest, Gurvich added., A non-parole period that is too long becomes “counterproductive”, he argued during discussions about his potential to reoffend., Todd has been diagnosed with a sexual sadism disorder, which Justice David Beach said was a “potent” indicator of a person’s likelihood of reoffending. There is no known effective treatment for the disorder., Gurvich challenged Beach’s claim it would be speculation to say there might be some treatment developed in the future., “It would be sheer speculation to say that there would not, sheer speculation to say he would reoffend in the same or similar way in 35, 40 or 50 years,” he said.eurydice dixons killer jaymes todd appeals life sentence in melbourne court", "label": 0}, "train-206": {"text": "\nSick or disabled people on Newstart face 'unrealistic' obligations to find work\n, Those unable to access a disability support pension live in poverty and are ‘unable to afford basic necessities’, research finds, \nLuke Henriques-Gomes, \n\nWed 4 Mar 2020 18.04 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 4 Mar 2020 21.33 EST\n\n, The growing number of Newstart recipients who are sick or have disabilities face “unrealistic” mutual obligations to find work and sometimes have their impairments exacerbated while struggling on welfare payments, a new research paper says., The qualitative study – released as seperate government data reveals new details of the ageing profile of people with a “partial capacity to work” – suggests those unable to access the more generous disability support pension live in poverty and are “unable to afford basic necessities such as food, baby formula and sanitary pads”., Researcher Louise St Guillaume, of the Whitlam Institute, conducted in-depth interviews with more than a dozen participants in the western Sydney area who had a range of conditions such as anxiety, severe depression and schizophrenia, and physical impairments and injuries such as back injuries and heart conditions., Participants detailed struggles meeting living costs, including one person who had their house repossessed, while another woman who has depression told researchers how living on Newstart was ruining her financial situation., She was pushed into debt, having started a course because she did could no longer meet job search requirements. In the end, she was unable to finish the course as well., “The research found that people with a partial capacity to work have trouble with applying for the disability support pension,” the research paper said. “On Newstart they live in poverty and are unable to afford basic items, medication, doctors appointments, aids and equipment or meet their expenses as ‘jobseekers’., “They felt unsupported on Newstart and felt that their mutual obligations were unrealistic. For many their impairment/s were exacerbated, or a second impairment was acquired while living on Newstart.”, The paper adds to the extensive research about the difficulties faced by people on Newstart and comes amid increasing concern about the rate of the payment, which the government is under pressure to increase in real terms., Government figures show the proportion of Newstart recipients who are sick and disabled has surged from 25% in 2014 to 42% last year – a trend fuelled by a tightening of the disability support pension eligibility rules., Last year, there were 289,489 people on Newstart with partial capacity to work, which means they have an illness or disability that Centrelink acknowledges would prevent them from working full-time., And new data provided to the Senate in response to questions from the Greens’ Rachel Siewert shows that of that group, 61% are over 45 years old, while 35% were over 55. It means that of the 686,785 people on Newstart, one in seven were over 55 and had a sickness or disability that prevented them from working full-time., Existing statistics have shown that an overwhelming majority of people on partial capacity to work have psychological or psychiatric conditions, followed by musculoskeletal issues, although about 5,000 had cancer, according to data from July last year., Some participants in the study said the expectations placed on them by Centrelink exacerbated their conditions, including a woman who said that she had a breakdown after missing out on a job caused further harm to her mental health., “In fact, her psychologist noted in a letter when she was applying for DSP that even if she was to get a job it would be difficult for her to fulfil the obligations because she is so self-critical,” the report said, adding that “the system reinforced and perpetuated her supposed incapacities and failures through making her apply for jobs which she did not get”., The study also examined the system used by Services Australia to offer medical exemptions that allow sick Newstart recipients to gain a reprieve from their “mutual obligations” such as applying for jobs and attending interviews. Employment service providers will generally refuse successive medical certificates provided for the same reason., Siewert said it was “very distressing” that almost half of people over the age of 45 on Newstart have a partial capacity to work and were living below the poverty line., “Medication is often a discretionary item for people on Newstart and it is becoming more and more common for sick or disabled people to have to choose between medication or a meal,” she said.sick or disabled people on newstart face unrealistic obligations to find work", "label": 0}, "train-207": {"text": "Morning mail: Bloomberg quits, second Australian coronavirus death, AAP fallout, \nMorning mail: Bloomberg quits, second Australian coronavirus death, AAP fallout\n, Thursday: Billionaire withdraws from Democratic race as Joe Biden surges.

More than a billion animals were killed and threatened species were pushed towards extinction. Thousands of homes were destroyed., The 17 scientists from across Europe and the US, used computer climate models to examine the impact of increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on the risk of intense fires., The bushfire study used the computer models to look at a metric called the Fire Weather Index, which is one way to predict the severity of fires by combining wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, drought and the flammability of the fuel. The index is widely used across the world to forecast dangerous wildfire conditions., The models found the probability of the index reaching levels seen during Australia’s bushfires had increased due to human-caused climate change by 30%., But the scientists said the influence of extra greenhouse gases was likely much higher because when they compared the climate models to the actual temperatures, they found the models underestimated the extreme heat seen during the bushfires., Prof Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead author of the study, of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, said: “We found that climate models struggle to reproduce these extreme events and their trends realistically., “However, they always underestimate the increase in chances for extreme fire risks such as Australia saw in the last few months. This means we know the effect is likely larger than 30% increase lower bound, which is already a significant influence of global warming.”, The analysis also looked at conditions under a climate that warms by 2C above the pre-industrial levels. Two climate models found that fire weather conditions like those seen in 2019 “become about eight times more likely” in a 2C world, with a “lower bound of four times more likely.”, The study released on Thursday has not been peer reviewed, but is being submitted to a journal with all data being made available. The methods and climate models had been used in previous studies that had been peer reviewed, they said., Dr Sophie Lewis, a co-author of the study from the University of New South Wales, told a briefing the fires had broken out during Australia’s hottest and driest year on record., She said new records had been set for high Forest Fire Danger Index in all states and territories throughout the 2019 spring., Lewis, who is based in Canberra, recalled being stuck in her own home with a young family for weeks to avoid the heavy smoke from the bushfires., She said: “In January, the national park that forms a large part of our home in Canberra exploded in flames. It was just last week the fire was declared out., “Clearly this was an event with an enormous ecological and human cost. It’s because of this that it’s so important to understand the contributing factors to this.”, Looking only at observations, the scientists found the chances of Australia experiencing Fire Weather Index ratings as high as 2019 had already risen by “more than a factor of four” since 1900., The scientists that analysed the bushfire conditions are part of a project called World Weather Attribution that has examined the human influence on previous extreme events, including the 2016 bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef., That analysis found human-caused climate change had made the heat during the bleaching event 175 times more likely to happen., Co-author Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in the Netherlands, said it was “really scary that we are seeing such extreme conditions in countries that are as well prepared for bushfires as Australia.”, He said: “What’s really obvious in light of these findings of rising risk is that it will become even more important to build resilience and prepare for these rising risks., “But there are also limits to what we can do through that adaptation and preparedness. So it’s critical that we find ways of reducing the underlying drivers of these rising risks to avoid problems getting even further out of hand in the future.”, Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a UNSW climate scientist who examines extreme events who was not an author on the study, said: “Fire weather is a very complex thing to simulate., “Combined with everything about this event being unprecedented, its extremely challenging for climate models to simulate everything about fire weather perfectly., “Australia just just experienced its worst bushfire season on record, overlapping our warmest and driest year on record. We know climate change has a role in increasing temperatures, which is a component in bushfire weather.”bushfire crisis conditions eight times more likely under 2c warming analysis shows", "label": 0}, "train-209": {"text": "\nNorfolk Island residents sound the alarm over shortages of food and other essentials\n, Shops are running out of basics after freight company servicing supermarkets and stockfeed suppliers cut services, residents say, \nStephanie Convery, \n\nWed 4 Mar 2020 11.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 4 Mar 2020 11.35 EST\n\n, Norfolk Island is running out of food, its residents say, after the recent decommissioning of a ship by the main freight company servicing the island., Residents of the tiny island 1,412km east of the New South Wales north coast, which relies heavily on the importing of goods from mainland Australia and New Zealand, say many supermarket shelves are empty as shops run out of basics like toothpaste, rice and deodorant., “The situation is quite bad,” said Geoff Bennett, who owns the island’s biggest supermarket, Foodland, as images of empty shelves circulated on social media., “We just haven’t got enough capacity in sea cargo to fill the shelves up again.”, Until last year, freight company Pacific Direct Line was running regular cargo services to Norfolk from Auckland with the vessel, Capitaine Wallis, but the company announced the ship was being taken out of operation in November., After outcry from residents, the company scheduled another ship, the Southern Tiare, to come out to Norfolk while a more permanent solution was being negotiated., The Southern Tiare’s last voyage there was at the end of December. Norfolk hasn’t had a cargo ship arrive since. While the Southern Tiare is due to sail there again at the end of March, the intervening months have seen supplies reduce substantially, and the forthcoming schedule only provides approximately 50% of the island’s freight needs., After the Capitaine Wallis was taken off the route, the Norfolk Island administration organised Australian-government subsidised air-freight services to continue to ensure essentials came in., But with a weight limit of approximately 1.5 tonnes, compared to the 1,000 tonnes available on a ship, and a cost increase of more than 500% for some goods, air freight can only be a limited, temporary solution., “We are certainly facing some challenges,” Eric Hutchinson, Norfolk’s Australian government-appointed administrator, told Guardian Australia., He sought to downplay fears that there was no food on the island. “Stocks vary across the items that are available and from retailer to retailer., “If you’re a tourist coming to Norfolk Island you will get fed, and you’ll get fed really well.”, Hutchinson said planes were not a long-term solution as it was uneconomic in a lot of cases to transport things by air. But he said there was “no limitation” on the flights., “If there is additional capacity required, there’s capacity to be able to bring those flights forward as is required.”, While many island residents acknowledged that the island often had lean times, those who spoke to Guardian Australia said they had “never seen it this bad before”., Martin Cross runs Norfolk Stock Feed. He told Guardian Australia that he’s been out of supplies for weeks., “Normally I have stock all the time. I never run out. But I haven’t had chook feed for seven weeks,” he said., Cross said that due to a lack of chook feed, those with livestock had begun feeding oats, rice and other grains to their animals, further depleting food resources., “We’ve had our times when we’ve run out of things. But we’ve never had our shelves on the supermarkets as empty as they are now. There’s no toothpaste, deodorant, rice, flour. All the staples are not there.”, “I’ve probably got a tonne of stuff sitting in Brisbane waiting to come over that I can’t get on board,” said Cross. “Never seen it this bad.”, He called the situation a “national crisis” in an article he published over the weekend in the Norfolk Online News., Norfolk Island is one of very few remaining places in the world to operate without containerised freight, due to the lack of safe anchorage at the dock for cargo ships. Instead, ships remain out at sea, with loose cargo picked up with grappling nets and lowered down the side of the ship into wooden lighters that bring it to shore. The limitations add a further complicating factor to the freight issue., As of last week, there were six flights scheduled before the Southern Tiare was due to arrive. A working group of importers, stevedores, shipping agents, the shipping company and community members was meeting regularly to find a solution., “We’ve got a really constructive group that are looking at addressing what we want to happen which is a regular and reliable and cost effective sea freight service to Norfolk Island,” Hutchinson said., Norfolk has been governed from Canberra since 2015, despite a strong local independence movement. There are approximately 1,800 permanent residents on the island, with about 700 to 900 tourists at any one time during peak season, according to the island’s administration., Tourism is Norfolk’s primary industry. Many locals hold livestock and grow fruit and vegetables, some commercially, but there’s no capacity for large-scale industry on the island, so essentials such as toiletries, staples like rice, flour and cooking oil, and many discretionary items and foodstuffs must be imported.norfolk island residents sound the alarm over shortages of food and other essentials", "label": 0}, "train-210": {"text": "\nAustralian Signals Directorate has already spied on Australians, boss confirms\n, Rachel Noble tells Senate estimates the agency has sought ministerial approval to gather intelligence on Australians, \nPaul Karp, \n\nWed 4 Mar 2020 04.24 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 4 Mar 2020 04.27 EST\n\n, The Australian Signals Directorate has already spied on Australians in the last year, invoking “rare circumstances” and seeking ministerial approval to extend its powers in an unspecified number of cases., ASD’s director general, Rachel Noble, indicated in Senate estimates on Wednesday that although the focus of the agency’s powers was directed at gathering intelligence about people or organisations outside Australia, it had also produced intelligence about Australians., The evidence follows the home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo’s, confirmation on Monday that “detailed consideration” is under way to better use law enforcement to tackle “evils” on the dark web., In June 2019, the News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst’s home was raided after she reported on government plans to extend ASD’s spying powers to Australians., The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, dismissed the report as “absolute nonsense” but has since repeatedly called for a public debate about extending the powers, as recently as February., Noble said that “while much of our cybersecurity role, and the protection of Australia’s digital borders, is conducted domestically – ASD is prohibited by legislation from producing intelligence on Australian persons except in rare circumstances, and only then under the authority of a ministerial authorisation”., “This is an important safeguard, and one that is fundamental to ASD’s work,” Noble said in an opening statement tabled at the hearing. “Our responsibility to protect the online safety and privacy of Australians is paramount.”, Asked by senator Jacqui Lambie if any of the “rare circumstances” justifying production of intelligence on Australians had occurred in the last 12 months, Noble replied: “Yes.”, Noble took on notice follow-up questions about the number of incidents and how that compared with previous years., Noble declined to answer what the circumstances were, explaining that to give an example would reveal classified information., Earlier, in her statement, Noble said the Australian Cybersecurity Centre had “responded to over 1,275 cybersecurity incidents” since July, more than five a day., The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said there was “currently no proposal before government” to extend ASD’s domestic spying powers and noted that the home affairs department was responsible for policy development., Noble said that home affairs was considering the challenges of “the dark web, the proliferation of cyber crime and the horrors therein”., ASD’s role was to be consulted on technical advice about its own powers “to help them develop a clear view about where there are gaps”, she said., In July 2018, the government expanded ASD’s functions to include prevention and disruption of cybercrime conducted outside Australia, which included the power to do so for crimes undertaken or enabled by an Australian person offshore “in special circumstances, subject to authorisation by the minister”, she said., Noble denied that ASD had given advice about extending its powers to the disruption of cyber crime on Australian telecommunications infrastructure., On Monday, Pezzullo said the government “will soon consider a new cybersecurity strategy to succeed the strategy that was launched in 2016”., Pezzullo said that while “connectivity is a positive force for global human interaction and prosperity, in the shadowy creases of the surface web lies the demonically evil phenomenon known as the dark web”., “As I’ve previously advised this committee, it is the expert view of my colleagues and myself that the only way to hunt and disrupt on the dark web is to better use the lawful capabilities of our law enforcement and technical intelligence functions in closer partnership and under strict oversight., “As ministers have said, this is something to which detailed consideration should be given. That process is under way.”, The Australian federal police wants the power to be able to call in the ASD when its hunt for cyber criminals, including those related to child abuse and terrorism, lead back to Australian borders., In February, the AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, told the National Press Club while the AFP is happy with its current powers “there are some challenges there in some additional legislation that is required”., Dutton said he believed it was time to have that conversation, a call he first made publicly mid last year., “At the moment, if there is a server in Sydney that has images of a five- or six-month-old child being sexually exploited and tortured, then that may not be discoverable, particularly if it’s encrypted and protected to a point where the AFP or the Acic can’t gain access to that server,” Dutton told the ABC., “It can be a different picture if that server is offshore, so there is an anomaly that exists at the moment.”, In 2013 Guardian Australia reported that the then Defence Signals Directorate offered to share information collected about ordinary Australian citizens with its major intelligence partners, according to a secret 2008 document leaked by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden.australian signals directorate has already spied on australians boss confirms", "label": 0}, "train-211": {"text": "\nClimate campaigners condemn 'insidious' cocktail party for MPs and coal industry\n, Parliament House event represents an effort to undermine climate action, environmental group 350 Australia says, \nChristopher Knaus, \n\nWed 4 Mar 2020 03.17 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 4 Mar 2020 15.33 EST\n\n, Environmental campaigners say a cocktail night involving the fossil fuel industry and federal politicians represents an “insidious” lobbying effort to undermine climate action., The pro-coal Liberal MP Craig Kelly and Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon hosted a cocktail event at Parliament House to discuss carbon capture and storage with industry leaders on Wednesday night., An invite seen by the Guardian was sent out by Kelly and Fitzgibbon, who chair the parliamentary friends of resources, together with representatives of Santos and the carbon capture body CO2CRC. The event is described as a “cocktail event to mark the inaugural meeting of the CO2CRC Carbon Capture and Storage Policy Forum”., That forum features companies such as BHP, Chevron, Coal21, ENI, Exxon, the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, JPower, Shell and Woodside., The invite says the forum aims to “work with governments, industry and other stakeholders” to create “suitable policy settings and a regulatory framework to accelerate the development and deployment of CCS technology in Australia”., “CCS has the potential to create a new wealth-creating industry for Australia, breathe new life into existing industries by reducing carbon emissions, and underpin the development of new energies such as hydrogen,” the invite said., Environment group 350 Australia says the event shows the need to “crack down on the undue influence of lobby groups on our democracy”., The 350 Australia chief executive, Lucy Manne, said the event was an “insidious effort by the fossil fuel lobby to undermine action on the climate crisis”., Manne said carbon capture and storage had proven a “pipe dream of the coal and gas lobby” and diverted millions away from proven renewables., “The climate crisis has been felt across the country this past summer, with communities suffering due to extreme bushfires, drought, floods and heatwaves,” she said., “It’s outrageous that instead of working out how to rapidly transition to the renewable energy future the vast majority of Australians and businesses want, our elected representatives will tonight be sipping cocktails with the coal lobby and discussing how to extend the life of dirty coal-burning power stations.”, Such lobbying is generally hidden from the public unless revealed by the media. The Fitzgibbon-Kelly cocktail event was reported in News Corp papers., It does not appear in any of the transparency measures governing lobbying. Federal ministers are also not required to disclose who they have met with, unlike in states like Queensland and New South Wales., “One of the things that we’re calling for is the politicians to pledge for a whole range of transparency reforms so we have much better transparency around donations,” Manne told the Guardian., “We also want more transparency around lobbying.

The prime minister characterised that question as “desperate” and “feeble”., Before Wednesday’s appearance at estimates, Sport Australia had previously given evidence that McKenzie sent the agency a signed brief, dated 4 April, and an attached list of successful grant recipients, at 8.46am on 11 April – the day the parliament was prorogued., The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) – the agency that kicked off the sports rorts controversy by savaging the Coalition’s administration of the program – told a different story on Monday night., The ANAO told an estimates hearing its records indicated that McKenzie’s office sent another email to Morrison’s office at 12.35pm on 11 April, with different grants. One project was deleted and another nine were added. At 12.43pm McKenzie’s office sent that material to Sports Australia., Luke McCann, the chief operating officer at Sport Australia, acknowledged he was in error by failing to mention the second contact from McKenzie’s office on 11 April. He said a correction to the evidence was being prepared – although Colbeck, the responsible minister, said he didn’t regard the omission as “misleading the Senate”., McCann was asked what explanation McKenzie’s office gave Sport Australia for sending a brief with two different lists attached during the caretaker period. McCann said the minister’s office told Sport Australia the second email was sent because there was an error with the first email., “We were advised at 12.43pm that there were some errors in that brief and that this was the correct brief,” McCann told Wednesday’s hearing. “That was how it was characterised by the minister’s office.”, The chief operating officer indicated this had happened before, during the first round of grants under the program. The minister’s office had sent a brief with a list of approved grants and then subsequently amended the list. He said in that instance the minister’s office had again indicated there had been an error., McCann said the changes between the first and the second email on 11 April added about $2.7m to the cost of the program., The ANAO on Monday night told an estimates hearing McKenzie’s office maintained the spreadsheet of successful sports grants applications at all stages, but there were representations from Morrison’s office. Brian Boyd, the performance audit services group executive director, said not all the high level representations led to a change, but “sometimes they did”., “For example, when I referred to one project coming out and one project coming in, in terms of the 8.46am version, that was at the request of the prime minister’s office,” Boyd said. “But of the changes made later that day, for the 12.43pm version, none were evident as being at the request of the prime minister’s office rather than the minister’s office making the changes.”, Labor says sports grants has become a trust issue for Morrison. Anthony Albanese told the ABC on Wednesday “the prime minister’s office has been in this up to the neck, and that is obvious for all to see”., Albanese declared there was now a pattern of behaviour, from obfuscating over a family holiday in Hawaii to “the Brian Houston incident whereby for reasons beyond my comprehension, the prime minister said that was just gossip, and now a month later has confirmed that it’s a fact”., “And on sports rorts, we have seen an attempt to cover this up.”, Morrison told parliament the government was taking the grants imbroglio “extremely seriously”., “One side of the house is taking this matter very seriously and has taken the actions that are necessary, and the other side of the houses just engages in a desperate political smear campaign to prop up what is a very feeble leader of the Labor party,” the prime minister said.new email puts morrison back in firing line over sports rorts", "label": 0}, "train-213": {"text": "Frydenberg defends Coalition's economic record after national accounts – as it happened, The economy holds the headlines as government inches closer to releasing its stimulus package in response to coronavirus.

He had some thoughts:, The government appointed Gerard Boyce to the Fair Work Commission a little over a year ago., Last year he had to be counselled for making partisan political and anti-union social media posts – damaging the commission’s reputation as a fair and impartial umpire., In Senate estimates today we learned this same guy decorated his section of the workplace with “a large number” of sexualised anime figurines that were the basis of an avalanche of complaints from his colleagues., What did he do in response to these complaints? He set up surveillance cameras in his office., This is truly bizarre behaviour and the government must explain how they think Mr Boyce is a fit and proper person to hold this important position., I welcome Senator Marise Payne’s acknowledgement in estimates that this behaviour is inappropriate and her undertaking to raise it with Minister Christian Porter., But the conduct revealed today will undermine trust in the professionalism of the commission. The government must act to restore that trust.,  ...Mr Porter is due to make further appointments to the commission in the coming weeks.

It would certainly be unhelpful at the very least and may for some viewers be considered partisan or political in some way ...

The deputy prime minister made a big song and dance about *writing* to the states and territories today, asking them to speed up infrastructure projects. For the good of the nation., This is *literally* what the prime minister Scott Morrison had to say about this yesterday in a press conference, when asked about that very thing:, Now, we brought forward $3.8bn worth of infrastructure projects last year. And I sat down together with the infrastructure minister and the urban infrastructure minister with states and territories to identify those elements of the supply pipeline and our infrastructure program to get as much of that into this next, you know, this six months and the next financial year. , Now, I’m pleased we did that, because that means those projects are now being accelerated and that will play a part in what can be made to occur. And if there are any elements of that that we can move more quickly, fine. , But it’s not a simple thing to do. You can’t just turn on an infrastructure project, not even necessarily one that’s even under way in terms of ramping up its level of activity.,  I mean, they will have issues about supply lines as well. And so what you have to focus on is that is the things that can move more readily. , We’re dealing with a very time limited issue here, because the demand and supply disruption impacts will appear for a time. , And when the health issue is addressed and passes, then the economy will return to what was a more structurally sound basis. , And it’s important that when you address the budgetary issues, you also keep in mind the structural integrity of the budget., DO THESE PEOPLE EVEN TALK TO EACH OTHER?, Updated\nat 1.18am EST\n, \n\n12.27am EST\n00:27\n\n, He seems like a good bloke and all, and I will never begrudge anyone doing overtime, but come on people., “It’s flat out.

But an overloaded system that discourages or delays genuine claims disadvantages all asylum claims.”, The apparent link between the online lodgement system and the surge in claims comes despite the government announcing $5m in the 2017-18 budget to “further strengthen the integrity” of the electronic authority system., Keneally also warned that with an increased number of people on bridging visas, the backlog leads to a growing “honeypot” for people smugglers who facilitate travel to Australia for the specific purpose of having an extended stay in our country, often to access the labour market., “As that continues, along with the wilful ignorance on the part of the government, the exploitation of these vulnerable people – a developing economic underclass – will only continue to grow., “Plain and simple – this is a work scam.”, Since taking on the home affairs portfolio, Keneally has been targeting minister Peter Dutton over plane arrivals and the growing number of temporary migrants in Australia, saying their number has doubled since 2007 to 1 million people, or 4% of the population., A large cohort of this is the more than 216,000 people on bridging visas in Australia, with the majority of those waiting for the department of home affairs to process their visa applications., There are also more than 62,000 people who have overstayed their visa living in Australia, and the administrative appeals tribunal has 66,500 cases currently listed before the migration and refugee tribunal of the AAT., She pointed to the “astonishing” fact that the processing time for partner visas had blown out to 31 months, leaving people in a state of “migration limbo”., “Our permanent migration intake has been reduced by the current government whilst the number of temporary migrants in Australia continues to swell,” Keneally said., “The health of Australia’s migration system is dire.”, Labor has established a Senate committee into temporary migration which is examining exploitation of temporary visa holders and the number of airplane arrivals claiming asylum, and how this is flowing through to the Australian economy more broadly., Keneally said the government did not have a plan to stop the “slavery-like conditions” that were afflicting the temporary migrant workforce, and called for increased funding and “identity management improvements” to get on top of the issue., “It’s incumbent on the Morrison government to try and stem these arrivals because a failure to do so will only add to the intractable caseload,” she said.keneally says surge in visitors on tourist visas claiming asylum exposes dire system", "label": 0}, "train-220": {"text": "\nDrought-breaking rain brings joy to some Australian towns, but many dams still await relief\n, Heavy rainfall across New South Wales and Queensland boosts rivers and allow farmers to plant crops for the first time in several seasons, \nGraham Readfearn, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 02.05 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 03.00 EST\n\n, Heavy and widespread rain across three states is bringing joy to parched towns with some farming regions receiving “drought-breaking” rains., Further rainfall from ex-Tropical Cyclone Esther was delivering water into regional water storages and rivers, with farmers able to plant crops for the first time in several seasons., WaterNSW said major flows from Queensland were boosting flows into the Barwon-Darling river system that was seeing its biggest natural flows since 2016., But the state’s water supply agency said even though many of its water storages were building, many were still in “drought territory”., The Bureau of Meteorology issued a drought update on Thursday, showing there were still large areas of New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory with rainfall well below average for the past month., But the falls in the past two days appeared likely to change that picture. Flood warnings were current for about 10 rivers around the state., Severe weather warnings for heavy rain and locally damaging winds remain current over parts of eastern Australia with a risk of severe storms in Qld and NSW later today.

Birdsville had seen 125mm in two days., National Farmers’ Federation CEO Tony Mahar told Guardian Australia: “The rains are certainly drought-breaking in many areas.”, Moree, Dubbo, Parkes, Guyra, Tamworth, and south on the Monaro, the NFF said, had received welcome falls., “The impact of this wet weather on the psyche of farmers, can’t be overstated,” said Mahar., “Many grain growing regions are now in a position to sow a winter crop and livestock producers are starting to see good pasture growth.”, 🌧️ Rejoice! Rain has drenched central NSW today, with over 90mm recorded in #deniliquin#abcriverina @abcnews @abcrural Shot on the #GH5 pic.twitter.com/q68CovZdHr, He said the rainfall was the most widespread seen in 2020, but “there will always be, very unfortunately, areas that miss out.”, He added: “While the dams have filled and soil moisture levels replenished, the recovery from drought won’t happen overnight.”, Mahar pointed to government agriculture data released earlier this week that showed many NSW farms would record “zero farm cash incomes” for 2019 and 2020., Mahar said: “Farmers have been pushed to the limit in terms of cash reserves and access to capital. Many livestock producers have also almost entirely destocked. Restocking will be challenging with supply pushing the price of cattle in particular, sky high.”, Drought assistance measures would play an important role in the recovery of drought affected farmers, he said, as cash would take time to flow., WaterNSW executive manager Adrian Langdon said there had been good and steady rainfalls across the whole state. “We expect to see some good river flows, but it’s not drought-breaking for water storages., Great seeing the rain.....

This, he said, had given an extra four to five months of water supply., He said: “The commentary I’m getting from people is that it’s nice for them to be talking about water again. This has been an extremely hard drought up north., “The soil moisture is up and they can plant a crop for the first time in six seasons and get an income and put some food on the table., “The feeling of having grass and feed changes people’s attitudes and gives them a feeling that there’s a change in the weather and that there’s a chance it might be breaking.

We heard throughout the inquiry that workplace sexual harassment is pervasive. It occurs in every industry, in every location and at every level. This is not simply the story of a few bad apples. Women are still most at risk, but we also heard from men who’d been harassed at work ..., “Young people under the age of 30 are at the highest risk, as well as LGBTQI workers, workers with a disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers and migrant workers. We also now understand that some industries and environments create a higher risk of sexual harassment. We heard that gender inequality is the key power disparity that drives sexual harassment, along with other cultural and systemic factors.”, Jenkins noted “new” barriers to combatting sexual harassment including the impact of media reporting, the low rate of union membership and “the numbers of women in employment, if not in leadership”., “We heard now more than ever making a complaint of sexual harassment can risk a complainant’s income, job prospects, mental health, family wellbeing and community connection.”, Jenkins noted workplace sexual harassment was estimated to cost $3.8bn in 2018., Updated\nat 12.48am EST\n, \n\n12.43am EST\n00:43\n\n, Just back on the tone policing on Anne Aly from Alex Hawke there – which is what it was, let’s be clear here.

What we discovered was the system on sexual harassment for individuals, including employers and victims, was quite confusing as to where you go for what complaint. The purpose of that council was not to duplicate or create new bodies but bring those bodies together to ensure on sexual harassment we are all consistent, we understand what we’re trying to do ... and we can create a better system going forward.”, Jenkins noted the terms of reference include a three-year review of changes, and she would like “to have progressed as many recommendations as possible” in that period.Other high priorities nominated by Jenkins include:, Updated\nat 12.44am EST\n, \n\n12.34am EST\n00:34\n\n, Paul Karp, Of the 55 recommendations of the landmark sexual harassment at work inquiry report, the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, nominated setting up the Workplace Sexual Harassment Council and “the legislative change we’ve proposed – particularly a positive duty under the Sex Discrimination Act” as the top priorities.The proposed duty on employers is to “take reasonable steps and proportionate measure to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation as far as possible”., Jenkins said: “The refocus to the positive duty was because it was really clear our laws on sexual harassment have really only been triggered when someone makes a complaint, and the evidence was really clear that Australians don’t want to make a complaint, and if they do there is a high risk ... so our stats told us only 17% of people who’ve been harassed make a complaint. So it was really clear relying on the idea this only comes into play if someone complains is a system that will never work.”, Jenkins said employers have responded to a positive duty to create a safe workplace, and the same will apply with respect to sexual harassment. “Employers as a general rule have been very well-intentioned about sexual harassment ... but I do think it will be something that they’re comfortable with, in time,” she said., Updated\nat 12.43am EST\n, \n\n12.34am EST\n00:34\n\n, Ken Wyatt is talking about the measures being taken to stop an outbreak of coronavirus in remote Indigenous communities to Patricia Karvelas on Afternoon Briefing:, In some cases you restrict the number of people visiting a community. Because often you will have public servants from state and commonwealth agencies. You will have tourists going through the area. , Now in discussions I’ve had with communities over a period of time, they will make a decision to shut down an area or will appeal to government agencies not to go out there during the most vulnerable period when the peak of any infection occurs., ... What they want to do is restrict access of entry, which is showing that they’re forward-thinking, they’re understanding what the implications are and they’re making a decision, because the community are doing it with their medical staff and with their community-controlled health services. , But equally, the committee that minister Hunt has established will provide advice for where they believe measures should be taken., Now in this instance you’ve had a community take the decision themselves. And so they’re going to have a mix of those, Patricia, in the way that they deal with them and I have every confidence in our Indigenous leadership that are working with minister Hunt. , But equally, the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, has flagged as well his concern for vulnerable communities and remote communities, isolated communities for a couple of reasons. , One is their own health but the other is having access to the right people to provide the level of services. It is a good approach by the commonwealth and we’re being proactive., Updated\nat 12.41am EST\n, \n\n12.22am EST\n00:22\n\n, Alex Hawke has attacked Anne Aly in the chamber during a matter of public importance on the strength of multiculturalism for “citing her diversity as being something better than other people’s diversity” and “ignoring reality”., “Many MPs have had a parent or been born here ... myself and when the member opposite likes to cite her diversity than something better than other people’s diversity, she ignores reality.”, “This is outrageous,” Aly can be heard yelling back. Hawke smiles. , The minister for international and Pacific development, who has maternal grandparents from Greece, continued, despite the obvious, obvious discomfort of most of the people in the chamber, including Llew O’Brien, in the Speaker’s chair., Hawke:, If I have offended you, then I withdraw. But your tone and the words you take into this House ..., ... The member for Cowan should reflect that people have come from all parts of Australia, over many years, and just because you are a migrant from one country, doesn’t make you better than from another and the tone that you take, as you enter that debate, that just because you have arrived more recently, or you have more chips on your shoulder, that somehow you are better than others, is exactly the essence of what has happened in this debate from the member of Scullin Andrew Giles, who introduced the MPI., Aly was born in Egypt and moved to Australia when she was a young child. She is the first Muslim woman elected to the Australian parliament. She has often spoken of the very real struggle she and her family have experienced with racism and xenophobia., Hawke’s contribution to this debate *is* outrageous. , Updated\nat 12.33am EST\n, \n\n11.55pm EST\n23:55\n\n, The sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, is launching the sexual harassment report., If you didn’t think workplace harassment was a problem anymore – oh boy. I hope you enjoy your cakes filled with rainbows and butterflies and your rose coloured glasses of privilege., As Jenkins says:, I met a health executive who had humiliating pornographic comments directed at her. She hoped that she would be able to make her workplace better by complaining. , But instead, she was treated as the problem. Which has made it impossible for her to work in the industry again. , An older male rural worker told me he was touched on his leg and propositioned by his male boss while driving home one night. When he rejected the advance, his contract was terminated and he couldn’t get another job without a reference. , And I spoke with younger workers who told me the best places to work were ones that were respectful, with leaders that were trusted, and where men and women were treated equally. , These experiences speak of the impact that sexual harassment has on the lives of too many Australians – and on our productivity. They show how our laws, workplace practices and community attitudes have contributed to the surprisingly high rates of sexual harassment. , While the same experiences I heard, over and over again, were all different, the message was the same. Australians don’t want to complain about sexual harassment – they just want solutions to make it stop. And that is the purpose of this report – to improve how Australian workplaces prevent and respond to sexual harassment. To provide those solutions., Updated\nat 11.58pm EST\n, \n\n11.51pm EST\n23:51\n\n, And Craig Kelly on his ‘misrepresentation’:, In the Age newspaper on the second of March, in the letters to the editor section it was represented that my comment, and I quote, “the evidence is clear – young Australians are living at a time when they are safer from climate disasters than any time in human history”, was made without any evidence in support of my statement. , Mr. Speaker, this is incorrect. My statement is in fact supported by evidence, evidence from the emergency events database known as EM-DAT, from the centre of research on inaudible on disasters..., And my statement is further supported by analyse of that data by Professor Bjorn Lomborg., Updated\nat 11.55pm EST\n, \n\n11.43pm EST\n23:43\n\n, Anthony Albanese made a personal explanation at the end of question time in response to the attack from Scott Morrison that he was “too busy having selfies with sports stars” for a coronavirus briefing with Brendan Murphy last week:, Mr. Speaker today in Question Time, the prime minister repeated a claim he’s made outside this house that there was a refusal to have a briefing from the chief medical officer last Wednesday. , That is not true. , The facts of the case is at 7.25pm last Wednesday, the health minister’s office rang the shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, saying that they’d been mixed up in Brendan Murphy’s office, the CMO and that he had arrived at Parliament to give the opposition of briefing. , That briefing went ahead at 7.30pm with the shadow health minister, my chief of staff and my senior health advisor. , At that time, I was with the prime minister at the vigil for Hannah Clarke and her children. That’s where I was when that phone call was made. I was unaware of any of this until the next day.

It will also be difficult if parents have to stay home because schools and child care centres are closed., People will face a choice between self-isolating and potentially stopping the spread of the virus and earning an income to pay the rent., Existing payments simply aren’t the answer, given this government has put in place a one week automatic wait for Newstart, AND the government is doubling the liquid asset waiting period for Newstart applicants., Many aged care, NDIS, transport, retail and hospitality workers are casual and they will be left short changed if they self-isolate.

It's time for a federal Icac\n, If we care about integrity in government, the Coalition must be held accountable for the grants saga, Contact author, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 7 Mar 2020 02.59 EST\n\n, Before we go forward, just for a minute, I want to look back. Let’s track back to last April when the Morrison government was mulling the grants at the centre of the “sports rorts” scandal., Politics was hurtling towards a federal election that the Coalition (well, perhaps everyone apart from the prime minister himself) fully expected to lose. Believing there were five minutes left to live, the government went into hyperdrive. There was a rush of appointments and decisions – in the press gallery it felt like a volcano was erupting in our inboxes., My colleague Christopher Knaus tracked some of this activity contemporaneously, and found in the fortnight between 27 March and 11 April, the government announced 70 appointments to boards, statutory bodies and tribunals, and diplomatic postings. One in five people appointed to government bodies in that fortnight had links to the Liberal or National parties., So that’s the time when the rubber was hitting the road on sports grants, round three. This is useful context to have in your mind: a government moving as fast as a retreating army, sprinkling explosive ordinance chaotically in its wake to impede the anticipated advance. Perhaps this wasn’t the high-water mark of commonwealth decision making. Perhaps people were making decisions they didn’t expect to have to defend, or explain., We can jump to the present now, or near enough. On Friday, Scott Morrison declined to take any questions on sports grants at his press conference. As well as that being a shocker, Morrison’s avoidance of accountability is a great pity in a substantive sense, because it multiplies the number of questions without answers. A statement issued by Bridget McKenzie on Thursday night opens brand new territory in this imbroglio, and things were already serious enough., Anyone watching can see sports “rorts” is a gripping political story. There is pork barrelling, a gritted-teeth ministerial resignation, which in part triggered a major eruption in the National party, and a rolling effort by the prime minister to inoculate himself from the fallout of the government’s failure to administer the program through the lens of public interest., But as well as the drama, there are questions of substance that remain comprehensively unanswered despite this mess spanning a couple of months. The question I’ve been asking about sports grants since the end of January is a foundational one: when it comes to this expenditure, did our government act lawfully?, Perhaps in the age of politics-as-reality television, in the Trump epoch, our collective expectations have now lowered to the point where these sorts of questions are now considered quaint. But for what it’s worth, I reckon these questions remain the difference between order and chaos; the difference between inhabiting a world of facts and liberal democratic norms, and a universe where the benchmark for powerful people is not the national interest but whatever you can get away with., So let me repeat this because it’s important, because it’s a measure of things, and we still don’t have an authoritative answer. Did our government act lawfully?, There are currently three tiers of legal uncertainty associated with this program. The first is constitutional. A leading legal academic has warned that the sports grants program may be unconstitutional because the federal government lacks power to hand out money to sports clubs, a view supported by other expert submissions., The second tier relates to whether the grants in this scheme were ever made with proper legal authority. This important question was raised by the Australian National Audit Office when it excoriated the government’s management of the program. If you want the full box and dice of the ANAO’s questioning, I went through this in some detail in a column at the end of January., If you lack the time for that detailed recap, all you really need to know is no one has yet produced evidence indicating the process was conducted lawfully. Sports Australia, the agency at the centre of the maelstrom, has told a Senate inquiry it has legal advice from an eminent QC clearing it of exceeding authority, but the agency is yet to make that advice public., Now we’ve reached the third tier of legal uncertainty, which are the new questions raised by the statement McKenzie posted on her website on Thursday night, just after parliament rose. Given this is still new information, let’s step through it carefully., Bit of background first. We know, because the ANAO has told either a Senate inquiry or Senate estimates, the following things: McKenzie signed a brief detailing the successful grants (which were listed at attachments) on 4 April. Subsequent to that there was email traffic between McKenzie’s office and Morrison’s office, and between McKenzie’s office and Sport Australia. This all happened on 10 April and 11 April – the day the parliament was prorogued for the 2019 election. Caretaker conventions were in effect from 8.30am on 11 April., During this to and fro, one project came out of the spreadsheet and another came in at the request of the prime minister’s office. Let’s pause here long enough to absorb the fact that this evidence directly contradicts the many breezy statements from Morrison declaring McKenzie was the decision maker and his office just passed on “representations” – including statements to this effect made by the prime minister in parliament. Bit of a problem, that., Another set of changes was made before the final material was sent to Sport Australia at lunchtime on 11 April, with one project removed and nine added. The ANAO suggested McKenzie’s office made those final changes. So three versions of the material went to Sport Australia on 11 April: one at 8.46am, one at 12.35pm, and the last at 12.43pm., I won’t divert us too much with outrage here, but this wrangling was going on at a time when official government business was supposed to have ceased, and Sport Australia was evidently perturbed enough to seek advice about whether this was OK in the caretaker period, when current governments are not supposed to bind future governments to major decisions., Now we arrive at McKenzie’s statement on Thursday night. The former minister says she signed off on the sports grants brief on 4 April, and made no “changes or annotations to this brief or its attachments after 4 April 2019”. This matters, because it gives rise to an obvious question: if McKenzie didn’t make the changes, who did?, Stitching this all together, we are now in a position where: 1. These grants could be unconstitutional; 2. There are separate unanswered questions about whether McKenzie ever had to the legal authority to allocate the grants in the first place; and 3. Changes were made to McKenzie’s decision by unidentified people who, wait for it, weren’t the minister., Let’s linger briefly on point three. I don’t know who made these changes, but I do know this. Ministerial advisers, no matter how senior and no matter who they work for, are not ministers and cannot exercise the legal authority of ministers, even if they think they can, or should., We could, I suppose, seek to explain this behaviour as pre-election chaos, or someone having a bad hair day, or someone stuffing up – and perhaps there is an element of truth in all of that, which is why I situated us back in real time at the start of this column., But if we care about integrity in government, this behaviour must not be minimised, or excused, or defended, particularly when you line this case study up with other things, like the unsolved mystery of how Angus Taylor came to use completely false figures in a political attack against the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, or the government rolling out another potentially unlawful program in robodebt., I’ve spent much of my career as a journalist in the national political sphere thinking we don’t really need an anti-corruption commission federally, for two reasons., The first was most of the political class I watched and interacted with seemed to respect – not all of the time, but most of the time – the self-regulatory norms and conventions of the vocation to the point where there were sanctions for transgressions., The second reason I was attentive, but sanguine, was media organisations possessed the institutional power to check the worst impulses of powerful people., Now, 23 years after I started as a reporter in Canberra, I question both of my previous beliefs, at a fundamental level., Our ecosystem is profoundly disrupted., Politicians are bolder, and we who watch them on behalf of voters are weaker institutionally., These deductions take me to the logical place. The case for a national anti-corruption commission is now entirely self-evident.sports rorts changes everything its time for a federal icac", "label": 0}, "train-226": {"text": "\nATO issues false, years-old tax debts worth thousands of dollars due to IT error\n, Exclusive: Debt letters demand payment within two weeks, with some dating back five years, \nChristopher Knaus, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 14.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 6 Mar 2020 14.04 EST\n\n, Taxpayers are being asked to pay false, years-old debts worth thousands of dollars due to system problems at the Australian Taxation Office., Guardian Australia received reports this week that taxpayers had received erroneous debt letters headed “You have an overdue tax debt”, warning they owed unpaid general interest charges., The letters asked Australians to pay hefty debts within two weeks. In some cases, the debts dated back five years., When taxpayers called to query the debt, ATO staff told them not to pay it and to ignore future automated letters and calls asking for repayments., The ATO told the Guardian the debts were being issued due to a problem with a new system it uses to process activity statements. The problem emerged in January, a spokeswoman said, and caused general interest charges to be incorrectly applied to the accounts of taxpayers., “We are resolving this as a priority and are in the process of remediating the affected clients’ accounts,” the spokeswoman said. “The ATO will work with affected clients as appropriate and will ensure that no collection action will be taken on these accounts.”, The ATO apologised for the inconvenience or concern, but said that no action was required from taxpayers or their representatives. The remediation would ensure taxpayers were not asked to pay erroneous debts., It is currently unclear how many people the problem is affecting, or the total amount wrongly raised in debts., In one case, the Guardian understands a taxpayer was asked to pay more than $1,000., The ATO has struggled with technical problems in recent years. In 2016, a technical glitch put large amounts of data at risk and caused critical services to go offline at a crucial time in the financial year., The problem was caused by the ATO’s 12-month old Hewlett Packard Enterprise hardware storage system and its primary backup, which are believed to have failed., Some of our services (incl. the portals &amp; our online services via myGov) are currently unavailable or experiencing slowness.

And it said it would install fast-charging equipment for electric vehicles at 12 sites this year., The government also announced a review of what would need to be done to reach net zero emissions before 2050., The Liberal administration in question was not the Morrison government in Canberra, where the climate policy debate remains focused on the cost of acting above all else, but the Tasmanian state government in Hobart., Peter Gutwein, a long-time treasurer who became Tasmanian premier in January after the surprise resignation of Will Hodgman, used his first “state of the state” address to set out what, by national standards, were a striking series of commitments that could put the state at the forefront of the shift to an emissions-free world., Gutwein, who has retained responsibility for treasury and also taken on the climate change portfolio, said it was time for the state to “showcase our innovation to the world and stake our claim as a renewables powerhouse”., “Tasmania has the opportunity to ensure that the most compelling 21st century competitive advantage that industry and consumers want – renewable energy – underpins our economy,” he said., Tasmania starts well ahead of other Australian states in the shift to low emissions. It mostly runs on clean hydro power and has already reached 100% renewable energy generation in some years. But analysts said, if delivered, the shift in Tasmania could provide an example for others to follow., Anna Skarbek, chief executive of research organisation ClimateWorks, said the new Tasmanian commitments were consistent with what other countries and jurisdictions that ran on hydro were doing. They are also in line with what analysts have found: that Australia had great potential to be a clean energy industrial hub., “It is a good example of a government looking at opportunities for future clean energy markets,” Skarbek said. “What we’ve found is, when the intent is signalled, international technology providers are looking for opportunities to invest in other jurisdictions.”, The most fleshed-out element of the Tasmanian commitment is a promise to offer $50m in funding, concessional loans, subsidised power and tax breaks for green hydrogen development over the next decade. Making hydrogen is an electricity-hungry process that involves using an electrolyser to split water into hydrogen and oxygen., With a report for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency having estimated an Australian industry could be worth up to $10bn a year by 2040, Gutwein said hydrogen was “one of the most extraordinary sunrise opportunities Tasmania could ever step into”., He said the state had already received interest from companies in Japan, Korea and Singapore, and cited forecasts hydrogen produced with clean power would have about a 15% price advantage over fossil fuel-derived hydrogen. “We know that with our renewable energy that we can generate green hydrogen cheaper than what they will be able to on the mainland,” he said., The other elements Gutwein announced remain little more than dot points. He has promised a renewable energy action plan in April, and a plan in the state budget for the government to have more electric cars in its fleet., Locally, the commitments received a largely, but not universally, positive response. Politically, Tasmanian Labor said they were welcome but long overdue; the Greens said they were welcome but nothing like enough to take the climate emergency seriously, and said they would introduce a bill that would go further., Outside parliament, the Wilderness Society described the new pledges as refreshing, while the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, said the green hydrogen vision was a “forward thinking plan for the state”., “It’s great to see the Tasmanian government backing our renewable energy sector by investing in this emerging industry,” said Leanne Minshull, the Australia Institute’s Tasmanian director., But both organisations had caveats. Minshull said the massive clean energy expansion should be used to drive Tasmania to zero emissions, including by moving the state’s vehicles and farms to running on electricity and attracting further clean industries to the state, before more was exported to the mainland via new undersea cables, including the proposed Marinus Link with Victoria., Tom Allen, from the Wilderness Society, said the state’s first step in cutting emissions should be to end native forest logging. He said the government still intended to log 226 forest reserves that contained more than 10m tonnes of carbon., “If this logging happens it would obliterate all the environmental policies he announced this week,” he said. “The quickest, easiest, lowest-cost way to boost Tasmania’s carbon stocks, protect wildlife and provide new, badly needed nature recreation spaces is to permanently protect these outstanding reserves.”inside the liberal state stepping into a low emissions future", "label": 0}, "train-229": {"text": "\nScott Morrison refuses to take questions about timing of changes to sports grants\n, Prime minister won’t address evidence from Bridget McKenzie that creates doubt about who made last-minute changes to the grants, \nPaul Karp and \nKatharine Murphy, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 01.26 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 6 Mar 2020 01.49 EST\n\n, Scott Morrison has refused to answer questions about the sports grants saga, as Labor cites fresh evidence from the former sports minister Bridget McKenzie that she didn’t change the brief and attachments laying out the controversial funding decisions after 4 April, 2019., On Thursday evening McKenzie revealed she had not made “any changes or annotations” to the 4 April brief approving the third round of sports grants – raising the question of who changed the material before it was sent to Sport Australia on 11 April, and whether the changes had proper legal authority., Morrison declined to take questions on the sports grants issue at a press conference on Friday. He said he was there to talk about the latest developments on the coronavirus, including a new funding agreement with the states to provide additional health care. “I’m dealing with coronavirus,” the prime minister said., Speaking on the Gold Coast, Labor leader Anthony Albanese said McKenzie’s statement, which was uploaded to her website after federal parliament had risen for the fortnight, contradicted the prime minister’s account that “it was minister McKenzie who made all the decisions”., Albanese said the public deserved answers about who had changed the material after 4 April. “Was it the prime minister? The prime minister’s office? Someone else?, “We know that the prime minister’s office made a change early on the morning at 8:46am on the 11th of April,” Albanese told reporters in Coolangatta. “Who made the further nine additional funding grants, with one removed, later that afternoon during caretaker period?, “The prime minister has to answer these questions and answer them very clearly. You can’t have taxpayer funds being allocated, and changed, and swapped around without knowing who was making those decisions.”, Morrison has sought to distance both himself and his office from the controversy, insisting that McKenzie was the sole decision maker and characterising the role of his office as passing on information “based on” representations from MPs., The Australian National Audit Office told Senate estimates this week the prime minister’s office had requested a last-minute change before the documents were sent to Sports Australia at 8.46am on 11 April, which was the day parliament was prorogued for the 2019 election. But another set of changes were made later that day., Constitutional law expert Anne Twomey told Guardian Australia on Friday that McKenzie’s revelation raised the prospect that somebody else made late changes to grants without legal authority., Twomey, who believes the sports grants are unconstitutional and that McKenzie lacked legal authority to make them, said the latest revelation was “bizarre” because it was not clear who made the changes, if not McKenzie., Twomey told Guardian Australia that even if McKenzie had legal authority, “if the minister wasn’t actually making the decision about which of those grants were approved because she made her decision on 4 April and somebody else – whether it be people in her office or whatever – made changes, that would be problematic from a legal point of view., “If you accept the commonwealth’s view that the minister is the decision-maker, either the minister’s staff as her agents made decisions to approve things after 4 April, which means she made that decision … or if they are asserting someone else made the decision, and that it wasn’t legally her decision because they were not her agents, then these actions have been taken unlawfully.”, Twomey said McKenzie’s claims she did not make the changes showed the “enormous dysfunction” of the way the government had handled sports and other grants. She renewed her calls for the government to explain the basis of its claim McKenzie had authority to approve the grants., Albanese noted that McKenzie and Phil Gaetjens, the head of Morrison’s department who investigated a breach of ministerial standards in relation to the program, a process that ultimately lead to McKenzie’s resignation, are due to appear before a Senate inquiry into the sports grants., “We actually just need some straight answers about this scandal,” Albanese said., “What we know is … hardworking volunteers would have spent hundreds of hours of time filling out application forms, thinking there was a level playing field, when in fact, the fix was in., “It’s taxpayers’ funds. And then there needs to be answers and transparency.”scott morrison refuses to take questions about timing of changes to sports grants", "label": 0}, "train-230": {"text": "\nHome affairs fought for three years to stop Serco detention centre manual release\n, Information Commissioner orders release, rejecting argument it would enable detainees to ‘intimidate Serco personnel’, \nJosh Taylor and \nChristopher Knaus, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 22.58 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 23.06 EST\n\n, Home affairs tried to suppress the release of Serco’s immigration detention centre operating manual by arguing it would allow immigration detainees to make human rights complaints as a “means of intimidating Serco personnel”., The Department of Home Affairs and Serco, which helps run Australia’s onshore detention centres, fought for almost three years to keep the company’s detention centre policy and procedure manual secret from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre., They warned the manual, if released to the ASRC through freedom of information laws, would provide a “guidebook of Serco’s operational responsiveness capabilities to detainees and ‘sympathisers of nefarious intent’”, an apparent reference to refugee advocates., The department, speaking on behalf of Serco, sought to characterise detainees as violent, querulous, unpredictable and dangerous, saying one-third had come from prisons and more than half were detained for visa non-compliance., They warned the release of the manual would lead to an increase of complaints to the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Commonwealth Ombudsman., Such complaints, they argued, were used as a deliberate means of pressuring Serco staff and increasing the “administrative burden” on the company., “Several detainees are known or reasonably suspected of creating excessive complaints to external bodies for their stated purpose of causing administrative burden to Serco and the department as a means of intimidating Serco personnel,” Serco and the department argued in their submission to the Information Commissioner., “The release of the documentation would provide querulous detainees with access to a list of specific processes which Serco undertakes in the management of property, recording of personal details, conduct of individual management processes and virtually every other aspect of detainee care, management and interaction.”, Serco and the department argued the “querulants” were likely to base “future false and misleading allegations” against Serco to “stifle the administration capabilities of Serco and the department”., The Information Commissioner, in a decision published last week, rejected the submissions and ordered the document be released., Commissioner Angelene Falk said she was not satisfied the “documents could result in a substantial adverse effect on the safety, security and good order of immigration detention facilities and operations as asserted by the department and Serco”., ASRC principal solicitor, Carolyn Graydon, told Guardian Australia the argument was “ludicrous”., “There’s a complete lack of accountability for the treatment of people in immigration detention centres so it is ludicrous to be turning the argument the other way around, when what is required is a statutory framework for conditions of immigration detention, which we lack in Australia,” she said., “We have common complaints of excessive use of force, common complaints that the risk assessment procedures being used are inappropriate and not reviewable and cannot be obtained under FOI.”, Graydon called for the department to release the document quickly., “It’s about shining a light on the darkest places in relation to the treatment of people in immigration detention,” she said, adding that it puts the argument that the documents should be exempt on commercial grounds “in the bin”., There have been no indications whether the department plans to appeal the decision., Guardian Australia sought comment from both the department and Serco. , Recordings leaked to the Guardian last year showed Serco guards boasting about the ineffectiveness of detainee complaints., In one recording a Serco guard claims he has been the subject of numerous complaints, but none has ever been investigated., “I honestly have no idea how many complaints I’ve ever had,” the guard is recorded as saying. “You know how many times I’ve been investigated?

The $500,000 grant to the Alice Springs based Red Tails AFL club to help young Indigenous men in the region was developed by NIAAA because the minister told them “it was who he wanted to support”., Other grants handed out in that six-week period included $15.8m to Wesfarmers for an “employment parity initiative”, almost $17m to the Cape York Institute for five youth programs, and $10m to the Brisbane Broncos for a girls’ academy and a mentoring programs., NIAAA secretary Ray Griggs said he could not say exactly how many grants were applications by agencies, and how many were approaches by the minister but “I suspect it is an admixture”., The NIAAA later released details of the 12 programs Scullion funded agianst advice., Scullion maintained control over the entire budget, but NIAAA had delegation to approve grants of less than $5,000 for Naidoc activities, Griggs said., “We were not involved in the process in the minister’s office,” he said and, under questioning by Labor senator Tim Ayres, could not say whether the minister engaged with the prime minister’s office in making the funding decisions., Only seven funding decisions, worth about $32.2m, have been made by the current minister Ken Wyatt, and they have all accorded with the advice he has received from NIAAA, Griggs said., “I am just stunned that someone in the authority of a ministerial position can have no accountability with the way he spent Indigenous funds,” Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy said after the hearing. “I’m just appalled., “And obviously we will have a deeper look at the details of that spending, but you have a department for a reason and he was a one-man show.

Residents also had no internet access, Eftpos or access to cash after all telecommunications were lost between Wednesday and Friday., “A remote Aboriginal person’s access to banking, food, fuel, services is their cards and mobile,” an Angurugu woman from Groote Eylandt said. “Basic card, Medicare card, bankcard. There is no cash carried in wallets., “After two days the supermarket became the focus of attention as it was difficult for people to understand why food is on the inside and hungry people are on the outside.”, Telstra said storms and flooding meant that technicians could not access the area to conduct repairs, and apologised to communities and residents., A spokesperson from the NT Department of the Chief Minister said telecommunications, welfare payments and the Basics Card are “the responsibility of the Australian Government.”, “In a complex and widespread telecommunications network, outages will occur from time to time,” the spokesperson said. “In remote communities the impact is often more pronounced due to lack of alternative network pathways and the longer times for telecommunications providers to attend and restore services compared to urban centres.” , The NT government said most community stores in east Arnhem Land have back up satellite communication., But one Groote Eylandt resident told Guardian Australia: “The idea that backup systems were in place and communications maintained is laughable.” ., Health workers maintained contact with patients by going door-to-door “but otherwise communication was extremely minimal”, the resident said, on condition of anonymity., Access to satellite phone reception was intermittent due to cloud cover and, because they don’t work inside buildings, sat phones could be used to make but not receive calls., In Queensland, the Cape York community of Kowanyama was also without phone and internet for three days between 23 and 26 February., “People here are living week to week and were running low on the power and food,” a resident said. “Some people were out of both by the Monday and the only way to purchase anything was through cash, which no one had., “People were sitting outside the shop distraught as they were hungry and had no power.

We were stuck in our classrooms with no communication about what was happening and someone had to physically go to the police station to get help.”, Other remote Indigenous communities have reported telecommunications failures since the start of the year., Galiwinku (Elcho Island) in the NT had two outages over Christmas, both lasting three days, and nine central Australian communities went without phone coverage for several days over January, prompting people to drive into Alice Springs to access money and food., A Telstra spokesman said: “While Telstra’s network is generally very reliable, we can still experience issues occurring due to natural events such as floods and fires, vandalism or accidental damage that can result in a loss of service. , He said fixed landlines and the NBN “allow for more opportunities for uninterrupted communications in remote communities”., “If remote residents have access to a wifi connection, they can still make and receive mobile calls using the wifi option available on many popular phones. ,  “We encourage remote businesses to also consider connecting to NBN Sky muster satellite service and ensuring their Eftpos machine is wifi-enabled.”, But the NT government spokesperson disputed this was a solution., “Having access to satellite broadband is unlikely to provide the answer for financial transactions in outage scenarios, as services may not function over satellite or not have backup capability over satellite.”, NIAAA said it had discussions with it’s manager on Groote Eylandt and will “have discussions again early next week”. Sam Jeffries was unsure of the timeline for putting any contingency plans in place, but said it would be done “as quickly as possible”., Independent territory MP Yingiya Mark Guyula said earlier this week it was not OK that people were going for several days without access to food and essential services such as power when the phone lines are down., “There are concerns that people cannot contact emergency services if needed, and that nurses who are working remotely cannot access patient files,” Guyula said. “This creates serious health concerns.”power cuts that left aboriginal people on nt islands with no food were widespread", "label": 0}, "train-233": {"text": "\nMurray-Darling: federal government backs off threat to take over NSW rivers\n, New water minister Keith Pitt in ‘good faith’ negotiations with NSW over 20 water-sharing plans, which were due last year , \nAnne Davies, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 21.56 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 22.00 EST\n\n, The commonwealth has backed off a formal process to take over NSW’s river management and instead is having “good faith” negotiations with the recalcitrant state over when it will lodge 20 water-sharing plans for its rivers in the Murray-Darling., A Senate estimates committee heard on Friday that NSW was still to lodge any of its 20 water-sharing plans, while other states had lodged theirs., These plans include the detailed rules about when water can be extracted by each type of licence and when early flows and low flows are protected. They are critical to the success of the Murray-Darling Basin plan., In late January, the former water minister David Littleproud triggered a formal process to take over NSW’s management of the rivers and withhold funds under the plan, noting that NSW’s failure to submit is 20 plans, which were due last year, was “disappointing”., “It is not my intention to approve commonwealth expenditure to New South Wales related to the basin plan until there is demonstrated progress on water resource plans,” he wrote., But despite the NSW water minister, Melinda Pavey, failing to reply within the two weeks to the formal notice, triggering formal mediation, the committee heard the new federal water minister, Keith Pitt, has backed off., Bureaucrats told the committee Pitt was now in discussion with Pavey and they were “hopeful there would be progress”. There are also discussions about whether funds would be withheld., In the past both Pavey and the NSW Nationals leader, John Barilaro, have threatened to pull out of the plan and last week Barilaro called for a royal commission into the plan., The NSW plans have all gone through a first round of community consultation but more consultation is required and there appears to be no firm timetable for finalising the plans., Federal ministers were also grilled over slow progress in passing legislation to establish the office of the Murray-Darling inspector general and to give him powers to demand information from states and irrigators, on pain of criminal sanctions., The former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Keelty is acting in the position, but no legislation has been drafted despite being announced in July last year. Instead he is operating pursuant to a letter., The commonwealth environmental water holder, Jody Swirepik, had good news however, on the pilot project to get water into the Ramsar-listed Narran Lakes, near Lightening Ridge in NSW., She said the commonwealth had received about 10GL under an agreement with Eastern Australia Agriculture to forego taking recent flows in the Condamine-Balonne system., The exact amount of water will be verified at the end of the water year in June but she said it had been vital to rejuvenating the lakes, which are an important breeding ground for migratory birds., But she was unable to tell the committee how much water the commonwealth would receive from the overland flow licences, which the commonwealth purchased from EAA in an $80m deal in 2017., She said the licences had all been triggered and in the next few weeks she expected water to reach the lakes. She assured the committee that levees had been broken through to allow the water to reach the lakes and that it was being monitored. She said photos and video would be made available., The controversial $80m deal is now under review by the Auditor General as to whether it was value for money.murray darling federal government backs off threat to take over nsw rivers", "label": 0}, "train-234": {"text": "\nSarah Hanson-Young 'appalled' by behaviour of friend charged with assault but stands by character reference\n, Greens senator said both the man and his victim had spoken to her and wanted to move on with their lives, \nAmy Remeikis and \nPaul Karp, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 21.44 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 21.50 EST\n\n, Sarah Hanson-Young says she was “shocked and appalled” to learn a friend had been charged with common assault, but agreed to give a character reference after she was approached by both parties, who wanted to move on with their lives., The Greens senator and outspoken critic of violence has drawn criticism after it was revealed she had provided a character reference for a friend who was alleged to have slapped his partner in a domestic incident., Hanson-Young said she agreed to provide the reference after learning her friend planned to plead guilty and had owned up to his actions, and both parties had reconciled and wanted to put the incident behind them., The South Australian senator said some reporting around her reference had been “false and misleading” and her character reference was not in conflict with her opposition to violence., “I was shocked and appalled by the man’s behaviour. He was right to own up to it and plead guilty,” she said in a statement., “I was asked to give a character reference with the support of both parties to help the family move on with their lives. I stand by my reference that his criminal conduct – which he admitted – is inconsistent with his good character., “I do not and have never condoned or excused domestic violence, any suggestion otherwise is absurd. In the interest of the family concerned and their privacy, I don’t intend to make any further comments.”, Moments like this must force politicians and leaders to confront the brutal reality of the domestic violence epidemic in our communities.Funding and action is urgently needed to keep women and children safe. And honesty about the crisis is crucial. Thoughts &amp; prayers need action, In the character reference, lodged with a magistrate’s court, Hanson-Young said she was “shocked and surprised” to learn of her friend’s charge, which she said was out of character from the man she knew., “I do not know the precise details of the incident, but I can confirm I have never seen, nor heard of, any behaviour by the man that is remotely violent or otherwise aggressive,” she told the court., “…The man is now back loving in the family home and things are going well, he has told me. I understand that he and his partner have reconciled but I do not know any details., “Obviously the man has told me that he has no intention of reoffending in the future, and given of what I know of his character, I am confident that no re-offense will occur.\", “As someone who works in politics, I understand what reputation means in public life. In my view, a criminal conviction would have a severe and unwarranted impact on his reputation and consequently on his work.”, The revelations of Hanson-Young’s character reference brought criticism, given the senator’s stance against violence and bullying, which most recently included a successful defamation action against former senator David Leyonhjelm for a series of interviews he gave, which she said amounted to “slut shaming”., Leyonhjelm has appealed the decision.sarah hanson young appalled by behaviour of friend charged with assault but stands by character reference", "label": 0}, "train-235": {"text": "\nBridget McKenzie reignites sports rorts affair by denying late changes to grants\n, Former sports minister denies making changes during caretaker period as Scott Morrison continues to claim she was the sole decision maker, \nKatharine Murphy Political editor, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 20.19 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 5 Mar 2020 15.37 EST\n\n, The former sports minister Bridget McKenzie has reignited the sports rorts controversy by insisting she made no changes to the brief and attachments outlining successful projects funded under the sports grants scheme after 4 April 2019., In a statement on her website, the first public intervention since stepping down from the ministry, McKenzie says: “I did not make any changes or annotations to this brief or its attachments after 4 April 2019., “My expectation was that the brief would be processed in a timely and appropriate manner. Nevertheless, changes were made and administrative errors occurred in processing the brief.”, McKenzie does not identify who made the changes. According to constitutional expert, Anne Twomey, the revelation raises the prospect that somebody else made late changes to grants without legal authority., The Australian National Audit Office told Senate estimates this week the prime minister’s office had requested a last-minute change before the documents were sent to Sports Australia at 8.46am on 11 April, which was the day parliament was prorogued for the 2019 election. But another set of changes were made later that day., “For example, when I referred to one project coming out and one project coming in, in terms of the 8.46am version, that was at the request of the prime minister’s office,” Brian Boyd, the ANAO’s performance audit services group executive director, told estimates on Monday night., “But of the changes made later that day, for the 12.43pm version, none were evident as being at the request of the prime minister’s office rather than the minister’s office making the changes.”, In her statement McKenzie suggests that any changes made after 4 April were done without her knowledge, but she accepts ultimate responsibility for the decisions. “I was the minister for sport and therefore ultimately and entirely responsible for funding decisions that were signed off under my name, including and regrettably, any changes that were made unbeknown to me.”, The former minister suggests she only became aware of the changes through the Senate estimates process this week. “The brief authorised approved projects for the third round this included nine new and emerging projects which, it must be emphasised, had been identified and sent to Sport Australia in March for assessment in line with program guidelines.”, Twomey, who believes the sports grants are unconstitutional and that McKenzie lacked legal authority to make them, said the latest revelation was “bizarre” because it was not clear who made the changes, if not McKenzie., Twomey told Guardian Australia that even if McKenzie had legal authority, “if the minister wasn’t actually making the decision about which of those grants were approved because she made her decision on 4 April and somebody else – whether it be people in her office or whatever – made changes, that would be problematic from a legal point of view”., “If you accept the Commonwealth’s view that the minister is the decision-maker: either the minister’s staff as her agents made decisions to approve things after 4 April, which means she made that decision … or if they are asserting someone else made the decision, and that it wasn’t legally her decision because they were not her agents, then these actions have been taken unlawfully.”, Twomey said McKenzie’s claims she did not make the changes showed the “enormous dysfunction” of the way the government had handled sports and other grants. She renewed her calls for the government to explain the basis of its claim McKenzie had authority to approve the grants., Scott Morrison has sought to distance both himself and his office from the controversy, insisting that McKenzie was the sole decision maker and characterising the role of his office as passing on representations from MPs., But the ANAO’s evidence disrupted that line of defence by identifying specific changes that were made at the request of the prime minister’s office., Sport Australia, the agency administering the grants, was also forced to admit this week it had provided incomplete evidence to a Senate inquiry examining the imbroglio. The agency failed to tell the inquiry it had received a second set of instructions from McKenzie’s office on 11 April., Sport Australia told estimates this week McKenzie’s office had told them two versions of the funding decision were sent to the agency by email on 11 April because of errors. “We were advised at 12.43pm that there were some errors in that brief and that this was the correct brief,” Luke McCann, the chief operating officer at Sport Australia, told Wednesday’s hearing. “That was how it was characterised by the minister’s office.”, Labor says the sports grants saga has become a trust issue for Morrison. Anthony Albanese told the ABC on Wednesday: “The prime minister’s office has been in this up to the neck, and that is obvious for all to see.”, Labor has also been pursuing questions about whether McKenzie made funding decisions after the government went into caretaker mode and backdated her ministerial brief to avoid a breach of the convention. McKenzie says in her statement she signed the brief in Canberra on 4 April., Albanese declared this week there was now a disturbing pattern of behaviour, from obfuscating over a family holiday in Hawaii to “the Brian Houston incident whereby, for reasons beyond my comprehension, the prime minister said that was just gossip, and now a month later has confirmed that it’s a fact”., “And on sports rorts, we have seen an attempt to cover this up.”, Morrison told parliament this week the government was taking the grants imbroglio “extremely seriously”., “One side of the House is taking this matter very seriously and has taken the actions that are necessary, and the other side of the House just engages in a desperate political smear campaign to prop up what is a very feeble leader of the Labor party,” the prime minister said.bridget mckenzie reignites sports rorts affair by denying late changes to grants", "label": 0}, "train-236": {"text": "\nCashless welfare card loophole enables purchase of alcohol\n, Social services minister admits card’s restrictions can be bypassed in places such as cafes and diners but says that is soon to be addressed, \nLorena Allam, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 20.16 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 6 Mar 2020 00.35 EST\n\n, The social services minister, Anne Ruston, admitted during a Senate committee hearing there was a loophole with the cashless debit card which still allows people to buy alcohol., The government says the card, which quarantines up to 80% of a welfare recipient’s payments for use at selected stores, has led to a reduction in violence and harm related to alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling., But on Thursday night, the Senate community affairs legislation committee heard that some merchants outside the trial sites, such as “cafes, restaurants, cafeterias, diners and soda fountains”, could bypass the card’s restrictions under the “merchant category code” system., The code system allocates a number to merchants so they are able to charge items to the card and prohibits the purchase of certain items or services – such as alcohol or gambling – from “declared” outlets based on what is known as their merchant category code., The loophole is the “eating places and restaurants” category code, which includes places that have alcohol on the menu and are not on the government’s blocked list – meaning they can still charge alcohol purchases to the cashless welfare card, using the code 5812., Ruston described the code system as “a very technical question” and offered the senators, including Labor’s Malarndirri McCarthy, a “full technical briefing on the issues”., McCarthy then asked: “Does the merchant category code 5812 enable me to buy alcohol on my CDC?”, Ruston replied, “At the moment, yes” but said the system would soon be replaced with a more “granular” means of blocking purchases at the product level., The government said it had spent $3.4m on a product-level blocking trial that departmental officials told the committee was “working so far”., It has spent $50m over five years on trails of the cashless debit card, with expenditure increasing every year since then. In 2015-16 it allocated $10.9m to the trial, and spending increased every year to 2018-19, when it allocated just over $16m on the card’s rollout., The card is operated by Indue and is currently being trialled in Ceduna in South Australia, East Kimberley and the Goldfields in Western Australia and Hervey Bay in Queensland., Indue currently blocks merchants rather than products. It provides a list of banned merchants, most of which are pubs and bars in the trial areas., The government says the card is automatically accepted at about 900,000 businesses across the country, including Australia Post and big retailers where alcohol is sold, such as Woolworths and Coles. But cardholders have complained about having their cards declined at retailers that do not primarily sell these banned goods., The federal government is pushing for a nationwide rollout of the controversial policy. But critics say the card causes stigma, makes it harder for people on low incomes to buy secondhand goods and is difficult to exit., The government has set aside $128m to transition all Northern Territory welfare recipients from the current income management system, the Basics card, to the cashless debit card, if the enabling legislation is passed next month., However, independent senator Jacquie Lambie says “the government has a problem” with the rollout of the card, after her fact-finding visit to the Northern Territory and Western Australia over the summer., Lambie visited several remote Aboriginal communities to “get a view from the ground on how the card is functioning, before voting on the government’s proposed changes for its future”, she said. The real aim should be “to get people off the card altogether”., “That doesn’t happen if there aren’t the jobs. And you don’t get people who’ve been unemployed for a generation into a job if you don’t invest in them,” she said. “We’re on a hiding to nothing if we’re not building up their skills and confidence.

The measures helped avert a recession., Cormann noted that although the Coalition had supported the initial phase of Labor’s stimulus during the GFC, which he described as “proportionate”, the then opposition was “very concerned and totally opposed” to the second phase., At a press conference in Canberra, Scott Morrison said that economic conditions had changed “very significantly” since 0.5% growth in the December quarter, and noted weak retail figures, released on Friday, showing a 0.3% contraction in seasonally-adjusted terms in January., Morrison told reporters stimulus would be “something that is needed for a fixed period of time, that can be delivered with maximum effect, that also at the same time does not undermine the structural balance of the budget over the medium term”., “So when the economy bounces back, which it will, the budget will bounce back in the same way,” he said., In a new report on Friday, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s said Australia was “vulnerable” to a recession and slashed its estimate of growth for the country in 2020 by a full percentage point, from 2.2% to a miserly 1.2%., S&amp;P said unemployment, which is now 5.2%, could rise to 5.3% because the sectors of the economy hit hardest by the coronavirus outbreak – travel, tourism and education – were labour-intensive and the casualisation of the workforce made people easier to sack., “If the unemployment rate rises by up to one percentage point, as our models suggest, this will further dampen consumer confidence, drag on spending, and could stall the nascent property market recovery,” said its chief Asia-Pacific economist, Shaun Roache., Across the Asia-Pacific region, S&amp;P expects the outbreak to carve $211bn from the incomes of households, companies and governments., Roache said a recovery would now be later in the year than S&amp;P previously forecast “due to a harder hit to China’s economy in the first quarter, viral transmission outside China, and tighter financial conditions”., Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said it was “good to see that minister Cormann has finally acknowledged what Labor, industry groups, the Reserve Bank and economists having being saying for months now”. , “Business investment was weak before the bushfires and coronavirus having gone backwards for three consecutive quarters and has been a significant drag on economic growth.”cormann rules out rudd style cash splash to boost australian economy as coronavirus bites", "label": 0}, "train-238": {"text": "\nHave you encountered police enforcing Australia’s coronavirus social distancing laws?\n, We would like to hear about your experiences with officers since the introduction of strict new rules, \nGuardian community team, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 19.39 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Apr 2020 00.59 EDT\n\n, Since Sunday evening, when Scott Morrison announced strict new social distancing measures and a limit to public gatherings to two people, state and territories around Australia have introduced their own rules, fines and even jail sentences to deal with people breaking the rules., Some of the rules are unclear and the different penalties for each state and territory makes some of the new infringements confusing.

Most have a crew of more than 1,000 who often live in close quarters below decks., At least a dozen people have already been brought to shore off these ships requiring urgent medical attention., The NSW government hopes that after this medical work is done, these vessels will return to their ports of origin., “A ship left two nights ago, and there’s information that over the next couple of nights another couple of ships will refuel and restock and go back to their original port, or their port of origin. So, we are chipping away,” Fuller said., The International Transport Workers’ Federation wants the Australian government to allow the thousands of crew members on the ships to be disembarked and flown home to their countries of residence amid fears the vessels will become humanitarian disasters if coronavirus takes hold aboard., In the case of the Ruby Princess, which was sitting off Botany Bay, six crew had already had to be medically evacuated. The ship has been linked to more than 400 cases among passengers who disembarked on 19 March and 8 March in Sydney., The ship, registered in the Bahamas, had 1,100 crew members still on board., “We call on governments to repatriate crew members to their countries, leaving only crew for maritime operations, and the cruise lines should pay for it,” said Dean Summers, the national coordinator for the International Transport Workers’ Federation in Australia., “This is an emerging humanitarian catastrophe,” he said. “I feel sympathy for the passengers, but crew are living in much more dangerous conditions,” he said., At least 18 foreign-registered ships were docked or floating in Australian waters, with an approximate total of 15,000 crew on board., In New South Wales, the Voyager of the Seas and Celebrity Solstice, with approximately 1,200 crew each, were docked at Port Kembla near Wollongong, while the Radiance of the Seas (894 crew), Ovation of the Seas (1,500 crew), Spectrum of the Seas (1,551 crew) and Carnival Splendour (1,150 crew) were off the coast., As of Wednesday, six crew members from the Radiance of the Seas had been brought ashore to hospital, and there had been 79 confirmed cases of coronavirus linked to the Ovation of the Seas., In Sydney, the Pacific Explorer was docked at the White Bay cruise terminal, while the Ruby Princess was off the coast., In Queensland, the Sun Princess (924 crew), was heading to Gladstone, according to ship tracking site Marine Traffic. The Carnival Spirit (930 crew) was off the coast of Brisbane, while the Sea Princess (910 crew), Azamara Journey (408 crew) and Pacific Dawn were all floating off the Sunshine Coast. The Queen Elizabeth cruise ship, with 1,005 crew, was docked in Gladstone., In Western Australia, the Artania cruise ship and its 450 crew refused to leave on Wednesday, after 29 Australian passengers on board tested positive for Covid-19 and were taken to hospital., The state’s premier, Mark McGowan, said he believed “the federal government needs to step up here … I just urge them to resolve the situation as soon as possible”., The world’s largest private residential ship, The World, was off the coast of Fremantle with 280 crew. The Golden Princess (1,100 crew) and Viking Orion were docked in Melbourne, and the Pacific Aria (602 crew) was docked in Adelaide., Most of the ships were sailing under flags of convenience from Caribbean countries, but Summers said this was done to avail the cruise lines of tax havens and to avoid first world employment conditions and wages., He said if the cruise ships returned to the ports they were flagged to, they would not even have berths for them., In what is developing into a legal quagmire, the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, ordered the six ships off the coast of NSW to return to their port of origin, but they remained offshore., The NSW Port Authority has been permitting cruise ships to refuel and take on food, and the Radiance of the Seas and Carnival Sprit departed Port Kembla this morning. , The maritime law expert John Kavanagh from Pacific Maritime said Australia had an economic zone stretching 200 miles offshore; and a 12 mile zone that is considered to be part of the nation. In between was the contiguous zone between 12 and 24 miles which allowed coastal nations to police bad behaviour such as drug smuggling and pollution., But Kavanagh said there was also an exception of “innocent passage”, which allowed ships “as of right” to navigate through these zones., He said there were also obligations on Australia under international treaties, adopted by the Navigation Act, which imposed a duty to render assistance to ships in distress., Summers said a declaration of distress would trigger obligations for Australian governments, although he noted that when the MV Tampa, having picked up 433 asylum seekers from waters off the north-west coast of Australia sought the right to bring them to Australian waters, the Howard government refused., “We rescue millionaire yachtsmen at great cost, so we should honour our obligations,” he said., A number of the cruise ships currently offshore claim Australian ports as their ‘home ports’ and operate in the Pacific, but they pay no Australian tax and employ few Australians., “The concept of ‘home port’ is simply an arcane rule and doesn’t mean anything. It’s the flag which determines what law applies,” Kavanagh said., In a bid to avoid a repeat of the the Ruby Princess fiasco of two weeks ago, the federal and state governments set up a task force, with the department of foreign affairs and the NSW police commissioner as the decision makers., On 28 March, the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, signed an order that means no one can leave these cruise ships, including Australian citizens, without the permission of the police commissioner., “Allowances will be made to allow ships to reprovision, and cargo ships can continue to dock but no one can leave them without the police commissioner’s express permission,” a spokesman for the NSW police said., Earlier in the week, the commissioner said: “They don’t pay taxes in Australia, they don’t park their boats in Australia, their primary flags are often in the Caribbean in different islands. It’s time to go home.”, On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean – which operates the Radiance of the Seas, Voyager of the Seas, Ovation of the Seas and Spectrum of the Seas – said that the ships were “in the process of leaving Australia”., “All scheduled passenger disembarkations in Australia have been completed and cruising operations suspended,” she said, citing a statement from Cruise Lines International Association Australasia. “This leaves a number of out-of-service ships, either at berth or at anchor, or in the process of leaving Australia., “Cruise lines are now focused on the arrangements to repatriate crew to their homes and families, and preparing their ships to be laid up with skeleton crew for the duration they are out-of-service., “Cruise lines are working with the federal government on approvals for out-of-service ships that are home-ported in Australia to remain here, while it is planned that the rest of the ships will leave Australia as soon as practicably possible.”coronavirus calls to repatriate 15000 crew members from cruise ships off australias coast", "label": 0}, "train-240": {"text": "Morning mail: WHO sounds alarm, childcare sector faces shutdown, the joy of hugging friends, \nMorning mail: WHO sounds alarm, childcare sector faces shutdown, the joy of hugging friends\n, Thursday: Daycare centres call for urgent government lifeline.

In a time of social distancing, the innocuous touch of family and friends is sorely missed. “One of the greatest paradoxes of this moment is most of us are feeling more tender and afraid than we ever have, and want nothing more than to pull close the people we love, to seek reassurance and comfort. Yet, for the first time in our lives, unless we live together, we can’t do this – not physically, at least.”, The Australian government remains unswerving in its commitment to tax cuts despite all the coronavirus-related economic uncertainty, writes Greg Jericho. But having not even been costed when they were legislated, amid this latest volatility, these cuts are now anchored in “scenarios of pure fantasy”. “Over the more than 2,000 trading days in the decade from January 2010 … the ASX200 moved by more than 3% only 13 times.

Commercial landlords and tenants, in particular, would be expected to “share the pain”, he said., On residential tenancies, Sukkar said the moratorium “does … not absolve people of their responsibility to pay their rent”., “Unless you’ve got an arrangement with your landlord that takes into account your financial circumstances, you are required to pay your rent., “We’ve strengthened the safety net to ensure people are able to meet the essential costs of day-to-day life.”, Sukkar said the moratorium on evictions was designed to ensure people were not left “without a home at this very, very difficult time”., “But at the same time we have to be sensitive to the financial realities for landlords who have repayments that they have to make and rely on the income stream from those properties in order to meet those repayments.”, On Wednesday O’Neil wrote to the president of the REIA, Adrian Kelly, complaining that residential tenants had received “threatening correspondence from their real estate agents regarding the payment of rent and notice around evictions”., In one email seen by Guardian Australia, which unions believe is typical of correspondence to property managers, agents are advised to tell tenants they must “continue to pay your rent in full and on time” and to recommend they seek relief payments from Centrelink or consider early access to superannuation., As part of the second tranche of Covid-19 economic support, the government granted early access to superannuation for those experiencing financial hardship, allowing one withdrawal of $10,000 this financial year, and the same next year., “Australian unions have been notified by their members of the intransigence of some landlords and real estate agents to broker a temporary rent freeze or reduction through this crisis, or unhelpful and unsolicited financial advice from real estate agents about withdrawing from their superannuation or their presumed eligibility for Jobseeker payments,” O’Neil wrote., O’Neil called on the institute to “desist from providing financial advice to tenants” and suggested that instead it consider temporary rent freezes and alert their tenants and landlords to the “landlords’ ability to access temporary mortgage relief through nearly every bank”., In response to the letter, Kelly told Guardian Australia: “The priority for our people at the moment is looking after our tenants and property owners, in particular those that have lost employment.”, Kelly suggested the ACTU should help “its own members in achieving practical outcomes for everyone instead of writing letters making scurrilous claims”., On Sunday the national cabinet agreed to a set of principles on commercial tenancies, including that “commercial property owners should ensure that any benefits received in respect of their properties should also benefit their tenants in proportion to the economic impact caused by coronavirus”., It said national cabinet would aim for “cost-sharing or deferral of losses between landlords and tenants, with commonwealth, state and territory governments, local government and financial institutions to consider mechanisms to provide assistance”., On Tuesday the Shopping Centre Council of Australia reached a joint position with the two peak retail bodies and the Pharmacy Guild, agreeing that tenants and landlords should agree to “temporary rent assistance” on case-by-case basis.real estate agents criticised for suggesting tenants consider using superannuation to pay rent", "label": 0}, "train-242": {"text": "\nOverseas, stranded and in lockdown: how Australians are struggling to get home\n, The coronavirus pandemic has left thousands of Australians stranded overseas.

Currently, parents have to continue paying the “gap” between the childcare subsidy and the centre’s fee, even during absences., This situation is leading some families to cancel their enrolments altogether, meaning centres no longer receive the childcare subsidy that accounts for a large part of their revenue. That is putting the future viability of childcare centres at risk., Monique Atack, the director of Hunny Pots Early Learning Centre in Glenwood, New South Wales, said the centre usually had 56 children, but over the past two weeks an average of just 15 were attending each day. More than 10% of parents had cancelled their children’s enrolment altogether, with that share growing by the day., “We made our first redundancy yesterday, which was heartbreaking. Being a family-owned business, our staff is our family,” Atack said, adding that staff members had also had their hours reduced., “They the government have got to act and it’s got to be immediate. If they don’t, we’re going to really suffer.”, Early Childhood Australia, a peak body, estimates that across most of the nation, about 650 early childhood education and care services – or 4% – have already closed. While those figures largely comprise outside school hours care, it also includes some long day-care centres. The data collected so far do not include Tasmania and the Northern Territory., The peak body’s chief executive, Samantha Page, called on the government to continue to pay services the childcare subsidy based on enrolment numbers in the first week of March, before the steep drop in attendance., The childcare subsidy accounted for about 60% of the revenue of childcare centres, Page said. She said the government should also waive the contribution required to be charged to parents when the children were absent., “It doesn’t mean that everybody could continue to be employed at the same hours, but it would certainly secure a good proportion of jobs,” Page said., She said this proposal would be a better support than the recently announced jobkeeper payment, because services may not reach the drop in turnover threshold. She did not want to see centres put in a position of potentially having to close – with their turnover therefore vanishing – in order to be eligible for the new wages subsidy of $1,500 per fortnight per worker., The country’s biggest childcare operator, Goodstart Early Learning, said its 665 centres remained open but were experiencing increasing numbers of absences. Goodstart told its 3,000 casual educators last week that it was no longer able to provide them with ongoing work., The chief executive of Goodstart, Julia Davison, said many of these educators were “extremely distressed” and looking for assurances that the organisation would be able to provide assistance through the government’s recently announced jobkeeper payment program. The group is seeking clarity from the government about its eligibility., “Goodstart Early Learning urgently requires access to the jobkeeper scheme and a viability package to keep our centres open and retain our dedicated highly trained educators and teachers through the next six months in order to continue the essential support we provide for vulnerable children and essential services workers,” Davison said., Helen Gibbons, the United Workers Union’s director of early childhood education, said parents were un-enrolling their children from childcare to avoid having to pay the gap fee, which in turn was costing educators either their jobs or their normal rostered hours., “What we’ve seen in the first wave is all of the casuals losing their hours and a fairly significant part of the sector is staffed by casuals,” Gibbons said. These developments were “tragic”. But changes to stop charging the gap fee could help “keep the centres alive”., Gibbons said educators had also been organising for centres to implement additional safety measures to avoid Covid-19 spreading, including temperature checks before children entered each day, as social distancing was impractical in these contexts., “You can’t change a nappy from 1.5 metres away,” she said., Last month the government made some changes, including increasing to 62 the number of days that a childcare service would continue to receive the childcare subsidy when a child was absent from care. It has also pointed to a grants scheme for special circumstances., However, Labor’s early childhood education spokesperson, Amanda Rishworth, said the government needed to announce a more comprehensive solution right away., “There’s already a direct relationship between the centres and the government. The government is already paying them a subsidy. Make it as simple as possible: pay the subsidy and keep them open.”, Federal, state and territory education ministers are considering regulatory, funding and viability measures.

This is Melissa Davey bringing you the main stories on Wednesday 1 April., Western New South Wales local health district said a person admitted to Orange base hospital with Covid-19 died on Wednesday after suffering complications due to the virus., At the request of the family, a district spokeswoman said no further details would be provided. It takes the NSW death toll to 10 and the national toll to 21. Earlier on Wednesday, NSW Health announced that a 95-year-old woman who was a resident at the Dorothy Henderson lodge died overnight. The woman is the fifth person to die from coronavirus in the home. There are 4,860 cases in Australia., More than 40,000 doctors, nurses, midwives and pharmacists who are no longer practising or registered will be encouraged to re-enter the workforce to boost capacity to treat patients throughout the pandemic., The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency on Friday said a short-term pandemic response sub-register would be in effect for the next year. This will be a separate and temporary register to the existing register of medical practitioners., Only those who are properly qualified and competent will be invited to register, so practitioners who lost their registration due to malpractice will not be included. While it will be an opt-out register, no practitioner will be forced to practise and can remove themselves for any reason. , On Wednesday morning Victoria’s police minister, Lisa Neville, and the premier, Daniel Andrews, both said partners who lived separately would not be allowed to visit each other under the state’s interpretation of the new restrictions on movement. But by the afternoon the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, reversed the ruling, saying Victoria had “no desire to penalise individuals who are staying with or meeting their partners if they don’t usually reside together”. Neville subsequently said the initial ban was Sutton’s idea but the change in tack made a mockery of the premier’s insistence that to comply with the new rules Victorians just needed to use “common sense”., Queensland will toughen its border shutdown laws from Friday, barring all non-residents from entering the state unless they have been granted an exception. Under the previous rules, people could cross the border provided they self-isolated for 14 days afterwards. But the police minister, Mark Ryan, said on Wednesday that the rules were set to change further., “Anyone who is not a Queensland resident or considered exempt from the restrictions will not be able to enter Queensland from 12.01am Friday, April 3, 2020,” Ryan said in a statement reported by the Courier-Mail., The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the government has amended the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations Act 1958 to stop exploitative exports of essential goods. This took effect on Tuesday., “The minister for health has now made a determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015 to enable the Australian Border Force to require that goods already in their custody be surrendered for provision to the National Medical Stockpile, or destruction if the goods are defective,” Dutton said., The minister said the changes meant people who have purchased essential goods at retail can not on-sell them at extortionate price, which is set at 120% of the price for which they were purchased., People who flout these laws would also be forced to “surrender the essential goods to the Australian Federal Police for provision to the National Medical Stockpile, or destruction if the goods are defective”, Dutton said., On Monday the deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said he would push the national cabinet to unlock modelling on how many Covid-19 cases may be expected in Australia, acknowledging that transparency is essential. New Zealand released a clearer picture of its modelling on Tuesday and there has been pressure on the government by some researchers and health workers to do the same., But Kelly clarified his position on Wednesday, saying while “transparency can be a very important thing”, modelling could be easily misinterpreted., “We need to make sure that it’s presented in a way that is useful,” he said. “The other thing I would say about modelling, and modellers themselves would also say this, modelling is not necessarily the truth. It is a way of seeing the world and potentially pointing out how one can influence certain scenarios. But if we knew the truth and could see exactly what was going to happen in the next few months exactly, then we don’t need to model.”, Guardian Australia has previously written about why calling for the modelling on Covid-19 is not necessarily a straightforward ask., Six of Australia’s leading international aid agencies urged the federal government to include specific measures to help charities continue their lifesaving work in Covid-19 support packages., The organisations – Care Australia, ChildFund Australia, Oxfam Australia, Plan International Australia, Save the Children Australia and World Vision Australia – said the not-for-profit sector was facing a perfect storm of falling revenue and unprecedented demand for their services fuelled by the pandemic., Eleven baggage handlers at Adelaide airport have tested positive, with two further cases among family members, taking the cluster of cases associated with the Qantas staff to 13. More than 100 other people related to the cluster, either fellow workers or close contacts, are also in self-isolation., South Australia’s deputy chief public health officer, Michael Cusack, said the outbreak had prompted a change in testing criteria. Anyone who had visited the airport in the past 14 days and who had since developed symptoms was now advised to get tested and self-isolate. But Cusack said health officials had not recommended closing the airport completely – AAP, Scott Morrison has offered a prayer for the national cabinet to stay “strong and united” as it responds to Covid-19.

Labor has also written to the Australian National Audit Office asking it to scrutinise the more than $200bn of government spending and more than $100bn in lending in the first two tranches of economic support., On 18 March the governor general declared Covid-19 to be a “human biosecurity emergency”, which enlivens very broad powers in the Biosecurity Act for the health minister to “determine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary” to prevent entry or spread of a disease., They are subject to safeguards that the requirement must be “likely to be effective”, is “appropriate and adapted” to its purpose and is “no more restrictive or intrusive than is required in the circumstances”., The Labor senator Kim Carr, the deputy chair of the delegated legislation committee, has received advice that the powers could be used to order telcos to turn over metadata, including location data, to track whether citizens are abiding by physical distancing rules and conduct contact tracing., On 23 March the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee endorsed the use of mobile phone data to enforce quarantine., Edgar noted on the Australian Public Law blog that as at 27 March the minister had made four non-disallowable determinations including to ban overseas travel by Australians and to use the Swissotel in Sydney for quarantine by declaring it to be a “human health response zone”., Edgar noted their non-disallowable nature “conflicts with regulation-making norms” – that parliament can reverse executive actions that go beyond legislative authority – and the orders come with criminal penalties including imprisonment., “The check on the power that is relevant is that the determinations cease to apply at the end of the human biosecurity emergency period, which is three months.”, Carr told Guardian Australia he is “concerned that executive-made laws do give the appearance of decision-making by decree”., Carr accepted they were “entirely justified for the defence of the community today” but said they need to be explained by the government, including their duration, which he said cannot be “indefinite”., “This is not a question of disagreeing with the policy aim, it’s about implementation, the arbitrary use of power by decree – there should be proper scrutiny of that., “I don’t want Australia to become like Hungary,” he said, in reference to new laws using the coronavirus to create indefinite emergency powers. Carr also questioned the use of the military to conduct quarantine checks, which are then enforced by state law enforcement., The delegated legislation committee, which is chaired by the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, resolved to write to ministers warning them that regulations must “be time limited where it trespasses on personal rights or liberties, or amends, or modifies the operation of, primary legislation” and calling on the government to explain what safeguards are in place., “Parliamentary scrutiny of executive-made laws is essential in critical times like these,” Fierravanti-Wells said., “By continuing to scrutinise legislative instruments which would ordinarily be subject to parliamentary oversight, the committee will play its part in ensuring that the government remains accountable to the parliament during this time.”, On Wednesday, Dreyfus welcomed the government’s decision to recall parliament to pass its $130bn third support package, which includes a new jobkeeper wage subsidy payment., On Twitter, the shadow attorney general said Scott Morrison “must not shut parliament down again as soon as he gets what he needs”., When the Parliament re-convenes, Mr Morrison must not shut it down again as soon as he gets what he needs – Parliament should continue to sit in some way, shape or form during the current crisis (e.g. with the assistance of technology or with fewer MPs attending in person) 2/5, “Over the coming months, the Morrison government will make decisions that will have extraordinary consequences for millions of Australians and for the social and economic fabric of our country for at least a generation,” Dreyfus said., “Parliament has given the government emergency powers to respond to this crisis., “Every member of the parliament has a role in ensuring that those powers will be exercised in the best interests of their constituents and of our nation.”, Parliament has given the Government emergency powers to respond to this crisis. Every member of the Parliament has a role in ensuring that those powers will be exercised in the best interests of their constituents and of our nation. 5/5, The shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has written to the auditor general noting that the first two tranches of fiscal stimulus were dealt with in a single day’s sitting and Labor expects the third tranche will be “dealt with in a similarly expedited way”., Gallagher noted parliament had increased the contingency fund available to the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, to $40bn and allowed the social security minister, Anne Ruston, to vary thresholds for welfare payments., Gallagher suggested the “unprecedented” level of spending and “novel arrangements and extra powers” given to ministers warranted an ANAO audit., Several Australian states and territories have issued public health orders and directions under their own state laws to implement a recommendation of the national cabinet on Sunday to ban gatherings of two or more people., New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria have gone further than the “strong guidance” to stay home by also banning non-essential outings., Breaching the orders is punishable in NSW by fines for individuals of up to $11,000 or six months in prison, or both, and in Victoria by fines of up to $19,800 through courts and $1,652 on the spot., On Wednesday, Cowdery wrote to the federal and NSW governments and opposition, warning that the current adjournments of parliament were “unacceptable and dangerous for democracy”., He cited the constitutional law expert Anne Twomey, from the University of Sydney, who has warned that “there will be very little parliamentary scrutiny of the government for nearly five months, a critical period during which extreme powers may be exercised”., “Even the darkest days of the world wars did not force parliament to close for extended periods,” Cowdery said., “NSWCCL believes Australia needs more democracy and accountability in these difficult months, not less.”labor says parliament should sit to scrutinise governments coronavirus emergency powers", "label": 0}, "train-246": {"text": "\nAustralian universities change admissions as coronavirus disrupts education\n, Calls grow to amend exam requirements and ease stress on year 11 and 12 students , \nMichael McGowan, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 02.22 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Apr 2020 02.24 EDT\n\n, Australian universities are changing traditional admission policies amid growing calls for state education authorities to amend requirements for students caught up in the coronavirus pandemic during their final year of schooling., Year 12 students across the country head into the Easter holidays with little certainty about how assessments will progress if school closures continue into the next term., While some state governments have announced changes to final-year assessments, ministers were unable to agree on the makeup of end-of-year exams at an education council meeting last week., “Ministers agreed that it is important that no senior secondary student is disadvantaged,” the education council said after the meeting. “Future decisions will ensure equitable outcomes for all senior secondary students as they complete their schooling.”, For now, state education ministers say end-of-year exams will proceed. On Wednesday the Victorian education minister, James Merlino, said final-year students “will complete their studies”., “Our students and their families, teachers and principals are obviously concerned about what the impact of the coronavirus pandemic will be on students who are currently doing their VCE or VCAL,” he said., “Our year 11 and 12 students will receive the care and support they need during this important time in their schooling., “We are working on a range of options to ensure they supported to do that. This includes a greater focus on online learning, the delaying of deadlines for particular pieces of assessable work and the timing of exams, and looking at what other supports we can provide.”, Other state education authorities have already begun making changes to requirements for year 12 students., In Queensland the education department announced on Wednesday that it had decided to drop one of the four assessments usually required for final-year students in each subject “to provide some relief for students during this time, and support teachers manage reduced classroom time”., New South Wales announced last week that higher school certificate exams would go ahead but principals would be given more power over the number and weighting of assessments. , Some universities have already begun taking steps to change the way they process admissions., On Tuesday night the University of Western Australia – one of the Group of Eight which makes up Australia’s most prestigious tertiary education providers – told potential students it was offering two new entrance pathways into its main undergraduate degrees., Beyond the normal Australian tertiary admission rank, UWA said it would also admit students on the basis of a predicted Atar calculated using a student’s year 11 results as well as a special tertiary admissions test., While there are some limits on the degrees offered under the new admissions pathways, UWA said it had made the announcement early to “put your minds at ease during this time of unprecedented uncertainty”., Universities Australia, the peak body for the tertiary sector, said all universities were developing “contingency plans” in case there was widespread disruption to admissions., “Universities use a range of criteria as part of their admittance processes,” said UA’s chief executive, Catriona Jackson. “This unprecedented situation is changing so rapidly that the impacts on both universities and schools six, nine and 12 months from now just aren’t possible to predict., “However, universities are nonetheless aware of the potential impact of COVID-19 on school examinations and are developing contingency plans.

As a former principal of the Templestowe College in Melbourne, he scrapped year groupings and formed an agreement with Swinburne University which allowed soon-to-graduate students to gain pre-acceptance without having an Atar and study a university subject in their final year of schooling., He says the disruption caused by Covid-19 could be an opportunity to take the pressure off students to gain university admission., “What I would like is for the ministers to come out and say to the kids, don’t panic, we’ll sort you out, you aren’t going to miss out on university,” he said., “There are huge mental health impacts to the current situation and its unfair to put kids through preparing for an exam period that’s going to be called off.

Many other former prime ministers, including Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Kevin Rudd, identify as Christians., On 23 March Morrison called for Australians of faith to pray as parliament reconvened to pass the second tranche of fiscal support for those harmed by the economic effects of Covid-19 shutdowns., But glimpses of Morrison’s personal practice of Christianity are rarer, such as his decision to invite cameras into Horizon church at Easter in 2019., In the video, which appears to be filmed in his prime ministerial office, Morrison thanked people for their prayers and described the world as “largely in trauma … with the scale and pace of what is unfolding – this is incomprehensible, even just a month ago, what we’re seeing today”., “Pray for the premiers and chief ministers, they’ve joined me in a national cabinet – which is unprecedented for Australia,” he said., “It is a moment like when Moses looked out at the sea and held up his staff … there are moments of great faith in this., “But as a prime minister I have to take my decisions based on very strong advice and exercise the best judgment I can., “And my faith gives me an enormous encouragement in how I can make those decisions and try and do that in the best way I can.”, Morrison then shares biblical verses from Psalms about God delivering the righteous from troubles and from Isaiah that the Lord “will guide you always” and “will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land”., “Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins – that’s a prophecy over our country, I believe – and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called repairer of broken walls, and a restorer of streets with dwellings., “I pray that we will be a restorer of streets, with people in them, businesses open again, Australians going about their lives again, returning to their jobs, returning to their livelihoods, returning to normal times in our schools so children can learn and that we can get to the other side of this.”, Morrison offers a prayer that begins “heavenly father, we just commit our nation to you in this terrible time of great need and suffering of so many people”., “And we do this also for the entire world – in places far from this country there are people suffering even more, going through tremendous hardship, crying out.”, Morrison also prays for “colleagues in parliamentary roles, it doesn’t matter what party they’re from”, ministers in his cabinet, and again for the premiers and chief ministers., “Pray that you’ll keep the national cabinet strong and united, and we may be able to face each day and each challenge with unity and purpose.”, Bishop Phillip Huggins, the National Council of Churches Australia president, told Guardian Australia: “The prime minister says he’s a person of faith – therefore he prays., “He’s just being true to himself – likewise – the prayer we’re asking people to share is consistent with our tradition.”, The NCCA prayer asks worshippers to pray for “those in need of healing” and the “Holy Spirit’s discernment amidst the many choices and decisions facing our national, community and medical leaders”., Martyn Iles, the Australian Christian Lobby managing director, said it was “refreshing to see a prime minister with the humility to consider and pray for others in the midst of crisis”., “Alongside his emphasis on practical measures, it demonstrates good leadership,” he said.scott morrison prays for australia and commits nation to god amid coronavirus crisis", "label": 0}, "train-248": {"text": "\nIs Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

The charts showed good signs, they said, but there was a long way to go., Analysis of coronavirus case data compiled by Guardian Australia shows the growth rate in new cases is now approximately 10% using a five-day average, compared with a high point of 27% on 22 March., Experts caution that this slowdown is likely to be due to a drop in travel-related cases, and local transmission rates need to be carefully monitored and suppressed., Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert at Australian National University, said there were “some grounds for optimism” in the apparent plateauing in the number of cases being reported., He said there was a lag of between five to 10 days between an action being taken – such as restricting travel – and that having an impact on the number of cases being reported., “If what you had was uncontrolled spread, then those numbers would be going up and up,” he said. “I will feel more confident in a week’s time, but there is a suggestion it’s trending downwards.”, Collignon said Australia’s number of reported cases was skewed by arrivals from overseas, which were now being severely restricted., “What we have to keep an eye on is the transmission with no contact,” he said. “Even though they are small numbers at the moment if they go up and up, then that’s a worry. That is transmission that is not controlled and that’s the part of the curve I would be most concerned about.”, Prof Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist at Monash University, agreed and said the plateau in case numbers was “very likely” a reflection of “the fall in overseas travellers, now limited to Australians returning home”., “It is likely that this plateau will only be temporary, as it is likely there will be a shift to more local transmission,” he said.is australia flattening the coronavirus curve look at the charts ", "label": 0}, "train-249": {"text": "\nFree childcare: what do the Australian government's coronavirus changes mean for my family?\n, The federal government has announced far-reaching changes to childcare funding arrangements. Here are the details, \nDaniel Hurst, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 19.34 EDT\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 2 Apr 2020 03.31 EDT\n\n, The federal government says it will make Australian childcare services free during the coronavirus crisis, with priority given to parents who need to continue working. It is promoting its plan as a way to help childcare centres remain open and viable through the crisis. It also says parents who choose to keep their children at home during the pandemic can remain enrolled without paying fees and keep their place for when the crisis is over., The childcare sector has been calling out for urgent assistance from the federal government as, over the past few weeks, an increasing number of parents have been pulling their children out of care. Because of the existing rules, operators have continued charging parents the gap between the childcare subsidy and the overall fee during absences. This has prompted some families to cancel enrolments, and centres facing a decline in their revenue have started to lay off staff, cut their hours or even consider closure., From 6 April, the government will start making payments to childcare centres at the rate of about 50% of the usual fees. It will be based on the attendance figures that each centre had in the fortnight before 2 March – before numbers plummeted. These payments will be instead of existing payments, such as the childcare subsidy. The government estimates these payments will be worth $1.6bn over the coming three months. In addition, new wage subsidies may be available to centres., In return for receiving the new government payments, childcare services will be required to ensure families are not charged a fee, including an out-of-pocket or gap fee., Again, childcare services that continue operating will be required not to charge families any fee at all., The government will provide the new funding directly to childcare operators. During the new arrangements, the existing childcare subsidy (CCS) and additional childcare subsidy (ACCS) payments will not apply. This means those who send their children to childcare will pay no fees directly., Again, the new funding goes directly to childcare centres. You should not have to pay the centre a fee once the new system kicks in next week., The education minister, Dan Tehan, has said the means-testing arrangements are no longer in place, because the government wants to ensure everyone who is working and needs to access care during the coronavirus disruption can do so., Before this announcement, a number of centres had already closed their doors because of the financial pressures. The government wants to ensure as many remain operating as possible., In return for the new funding, services will be subject to a range of conditions, including that they “stay open unless closed on public health advice or for other health and safety reasons”. Services that make a business decision to close are not eligible for the new funding., Families who need to increase their hours or days have been advised to discuss it with their child’s centre. The government is calling on people to show commonsense and understand that the priority will be given to those who need to be working and cannot care for their children., Yes, depending on the circumstances. Tehan said centres had been asked to prioritise those who need their children cared for because they are working, including when they cannot care for their children safely at home. Other priorities include vulnerable children who need continuity of care, and those who have recently been taken out of childcare., At a media conference in Canberra, Scott Morrison said: “In this new normal that we are living in, it is no longer about entitlement. It is about need. We are calling on all Australians to think about what they need and to think about the needs of their fellow Australians who may have a greater need when it comes to calling on the many things that have been provided.”, Parents should speak directly to their childcare operator if they have questions about how it will affect their services. There is no government application process for parents., The government is encouraging families who have terminated their enrolment since 17 February to get back in contact with their centre about restarting their arrangements. “Restarting your enrolment will not require you to send your child to childcare and it certainly won’t require you to pay a gap fee,” Tehan said. “Restarting your enrolment will, however, hold your place for that point in time when things start to normalise, and you are ready to take your child back to their centre.”, You will not have to pay fees to keep the place. From 6 April, the old rules about the number of allowable absences no longer apply. During an appearance on the ABC’s 7.30 program, Tehan was asked about parents who choose to keep their child at home and whether the place would still be available down the track when the pandemic was over. “Yes,” the minister replied., Childcare centres will be allowed to waive out-of-pocket fees for families where a service remains open but children are not attending for Covid-19 reasons, from 23 March onwards. However, this particular waiver is at the discretion of the centre. The move is designed to encourage families to stay enrolled. The new fee-free system takes effect on 6 April., The system will be reviewed after a month and the government will consider an extension after three months. There seems to be an expectation that the system will last at least six months in total., The government says the new arrangements also apply to family daycare services., These services will be able to access the new measures., Vacation care is also covered. However, the government’s funding to services providing vacation care only will be calculated based on the vacation period between term 3 and term 4 last year.free childcare what do the governments coronavirus changes mean for my family", "label": 0}, "train-250": {"text": "Morning mail: police crackdown, global cases surpass 1m, meditative cooking, \nMorning mail: police crackdown, global cases surpass 1m, meditative cooking\n, Friday: Man fined for eating a kebab on a public bench.

It said changes to the RFAs recognised a commitment by the premier, Dan Andrews, in November to immediately protect old-growth forests, and would allow “more timely interventions” to protect threatened species., Conservationists and environmental lawyers said the changes did not go far enough, and risked being disastrous for both the environment and timber workers., Legal organisation Environmental Justice Australia said the agreements had been renewed without properly considering what the fires meant for wildlife. EJA’s chief executive, Brendan Sydes, said it was a “massive failure of leadership” by both tiers of government., “They should have said the regional forestry agreement framework is no longer adequate to deal with the conflict between biodiversity values and logging,” Sydes said. “If they were not going to phase out logging immediately, they should have moved to assessing it on a case-by-case basis under the EPBC Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.”, A report released by EJA this week says the bushfires severely affected more than 3m hectares of parks and reserves set aside to protect the environment, and demands a shift in policy., The fires followed the Andrews government announcing in November it would immediately protect 90,000 hectares of old-growth forest and set aside a further 96,000 hectares of native forest to save the threatened greater glider. Andrews said native forest supply agreements would be extended to 2024, when a $120m package for businesses and workers would kick in ahead of a 2030 end to native forest logging., At the time, the premier warned native timber supply was already down about 50% in a decade, and that a large bushfire might hasten the industry’s end. He reiterated the point on ABC radio as bushfires burned in January., Victoria’s environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, this week said the updated RFAs would strengthen protection of wildlife and biodiversity, and meant the state was better able to respond to major events, such as the summer’s bushfires., “They recognise the pressures facing our forests right now and will enable us to adapt our management approach accordingly,” she said., Three forestry organisations – the Victorian Association of Forest Industries, the Australian Forest Products Association, and the Australian Forest Contractors Association – said they “cautiously welcomed” the RFAs extension as it provided some relief for the industry after it was hit by bushfires and the planned phase out., The federal agriculture department, which is responsible for forestry, said the updated RFAs took into account the impact of the bushfires through a “major event” clause. “This provision triggers a review of the impacts of major events, including bushfires,” a department spokesman said., The Wilderness Society called on the state government to immediately invoke the major event clause and review logging practices in light of the fire damage., Amelia Young, the society’s national campaigns manager, said a two-year review of the RFAs had shown the public expected native forests to be managed in a way that reflected all their values, including water supply and carbon storage., “Logging clearly cannot go on as before,” Young said. “Now, given the bushfires, and the uncertainty for species and for the industry, a major event review is warranted, timely and critical for community, forests and industry to recover.”, Janet Rice, forests spokeswoman for the Australian Greens, said none of the changes in the updated RFAs – including major event reviews, tighter timelines for assessing impact on threatened species and improved consultation with traditional owners – were strong enough., She said their extension would fast-track extinctions and the climate emergency., “We’ve seen this before,” she said. “The original agreements said that they had provisions to protect our animals and conduct reviews, but logging has continued as business-as-usual in the 22 years years since the agreements have been in force, bringing many forest animals closer and closer to extinction.”decision to renew victorian logging agreements criticised after summer bushfires", "label": 0}, "train-252": {"text": "\nHow coronavirus is transforming Australian politics\n, The coronavirus has provoked a radical shift in policy for the Morrison government, with historic stimulus packages, and a dramatic expansion our welfare system.

warning some are at risk of collapse due to falls in international enrolments during the Covid-19 crisis., Ahead of the education minister, Dan Tehan, taking a support package to cabinet to be announced as early as next week, Plibersek told Guardian Australia that there are “now serious concerns that without federal government action some leading institutions could collapse”., Universities, many of which rely on international students for more than a third of their revenue, are currently engaged in cost-cutting including asking staff to use up leave and instituting hiring freezes., But representatives of the sector have played down the risk, with Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, insisting they are “not asking for a bailout” from government, only “support to help us weather the period ahead”., Labor wants the government to provide universities with certainty by guaranteeing “proper funding for Australian students”, including paying at least the commonwealth grant scheme funding for the next three years based on projected student numbers before the 2019 budget., Plibersek also proposes “low or no-cost loans to provide stability in coming months”., “Australian universities are under immense pressure,” she said. “For years, universities have used income from international education to help fund their world-leading research., “The Covid-19 pandemic, and global travel restrictions, have led to a crisis in this funding model, with income from international students plummeting over recent months., “Australia cannot afford to let our universities fall off a cliff. The federal government must act now to shore up our universities.”, In addition to employing almost 260,000 people, Plibersek cited universities’ role in developing new treatments, cures and equipment and educating doctors, nurses and health experts, as reasons to support them., “They are absolutely critical to dealing with this urgent health crisis – and will be just as critical to our recovery in the years to come,” she said., “If the federal government fails to act now, some universities could collapse, which would see vital research cut, thousands of jobs lost, and leave students hanging in the middle of degrees.”, Group of Eight universities tend to derive the most revenue from international students, although are considered very unlikely to fail due to their large asset bases. The greater concern is smaller regional universities that also derive a large proportion of revenue from international sources, such as Federation and Central Queensland universities., Jackson said that Universities Australia has “been talking with government since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic about ways to best support university students and staff, research and teaching, and have greatly appreciated the collaborative approach”., “Universities are not asking for a bailout,” she told Guardian Australia. “Rather we are seeking government support to help us weather the period ahead, and come out the other side able to play our part in economic and community recovery.”, Luke Sheehy, executive director of the Australian Technology Network group of universities, said he “anticipates the government will consider additional funding for the sector, and that would be welcome”., “We hope that it will allow us to look after students and staff, and continue to conduct vital research including to combat Covid-19.”, Sheehy noted universities would feel the greatest impact in the second semester, when international students from the northern hemisphere begin studies in Australia., Guardian Australia contacted the Group of Eight universities and Regional Universities Networkfor comment.labor warns some universities face collapse as international enrolments plummet", "label": 0}, "train-255": {"text": "\nHow has the Morrison government responded to the coronavirus crisis? – Australian politics live podcast\n, Katharine Murphy talks to Laura Murphy-Oates about how the government has transformed its identity almost entirely as it responds to Covid-19 , \n\n\nHow to listen to podcasts: everything you need to know\n\n, \nKatharine Murphy and \nLaura Murphy-Oates.

The prime minister said he did not want parents to have to choose between feeding their children and having their children cared for and educated., “This virus is going to take enough from Australians without putting Australian parents in that position,” he said. , From Monday, the government will start making payments to childcare centres at the rate of about 50% of the usual fees but based on attendance numbers in late February, before the numbers of children attending plummeted., The government estimates these payments will be worth $1.6bn over the coming three months. Centres may also be eligible to claim the new wage subsidies of $1,500 per worker a fortnight., In return for receiving the new government payments, childcare services will be prohibited from charging families a fee – including an out-of-pocket or gap fee – and must stay open unless forced to shut on public health advice. Centres have been told to prioritise care to essential workers, vulnerable and disadvantaged children and previously enrolled children., The education minister, Dan Tehan, said the government was “turning off” the complex old funding system because it was “drafted for a pre-pandemic time”. The government insists the free childcare plan is temporary., Early Childhood Australia, a peak body, said the announcement “tackles most of the big issues that services and families have been grappling with over the past month”., But Goodstart Early Learning, the nation’s largest provider with 665 centres, issued a statement saying the plan did not offer “any comfort for the 3,000 casual educators we had to stand down last week”. It warned that it would not be able to keep its centre open unless the government guaranteed it access to the jobkeeper payment scheme., Speaking to the Seven Network, Morrison indicated that schools across Australia would reopen after the Easter holiday period, but said there would be a protracted period when many students would be participating through e-learning, while those who had to attend in person could do so., In the latest sign of intensifying restrictions to stop the spread of the virus, the WA premier, Mark McGowan, announced that his state would close its border from Sunday night, with several limited exemptions, such as for health and freight purposes., “In effect, we will be turning Western Australia into an island within an island – our own country,” he said., Morrison declined to be specific when asked on Thursday when Australia’s international border might reopen or other strict restrictions on public gatherings might be lifted. But he took the opportunity to urge Australia to “stay together” and brace for the long haul, ahead of another meeting of the national cabinet on Friday., “There is a new normal here in Australia and it’s one that we now need to get used to and settle into for that haul over the next six months,” Morrison said. “That is something that will go against the grain for so many, but we adapt. We can change the way we live, but it doesn’t change who we are.”, Morrison became emotional as he recounted being told stories by his grandmother about what they used to do as a family to get through the Great Depression., While the prime minister said it was a great comfort to him that his family had joined him in Canberra, he added that it was difficult to “imagine the world on the other side of this and to give your family some positive and encouraging news about how amazing Australia is and how we all come out of this”., Parliament will return on Wednesday next week to pass the $130bn wages subsidy package, which aims to help up to 6m Australians who face an uncertain economic future, the latest in a series of stimulus and support measures. But calls are growing for greater parliamentary oversight of the extraordinary measures being rolled out at a rapid rate to address the Covid-19 pandemic., On Thursday, Labor and the Greens both backed the idea of a parliamentary committee to scrutinise the government’s response, following the lead of New Zealand., Labor wants the parliament to return not just to pass the third economic support package but as a means of restoring legislative oversight, as most decisions to tackle the public health crisis are occurring through unchecked executive actions., The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, told ABC Radio either a Senate committee or a joint select committee “should be established to provide that oversight, both in terms of the departmental responses but also to hear from people about where there are gaps in the system”., Later, on Sky News, Albanese noted that Labor had supported and improved the first two tranches of economic support, but warned the government that “bipartisanship does not mean silence”., However, Morrison played down the suggestion that parliament should do more than “continue to do its job, as it is called on to do, in terms of passing legislation”., “The difficulty in calling the parliament together is a practical one, frankly,” he said. “We have got people coming to Canberra and moving to other parts of the country. As we need to call the parliament together, we will, and it will continue to do its job., “Equally, our parliamentarians, while they may not be meeting here, I know they are working incredibly hard in their communities.”, Morrison suggested MPs were busy helping their constituents contend with challenges posed by the current crisis and “frankly, they have got a bigger job to do out there in their communities at the moment than they would have here in Canberra”., On Thursday the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, wrote to Morrison asking for the creation of a joint committee with a non-government chair and 11 members: four from the Liberal and National parties, three from Labor, one Green and three crossbench MPs or senators., The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick who supports the plan, said a joint committee would “allow both houses to provide oversight, but a fallback position would be to have the Senate initiate a committee” - a threat to proceed with or without government support.coronavirus scott morrison scraps childcare fees while warning australia to brace for six months of upheaval", "label": 0}, "train-257": {"text": "Australian PM announces free childcare as Covid-19 death toll rises to 24 – as it happened, Victoria and Queensland register deaths as Western Australia flags border closure and federal government acts on childcare and industrial relations concerns.

Not physically at school?, Tehan:, What we’ve made very clear is we want the option to be there for those who can’t safely look after their children at home to be able to go to school and get their education at school. And all the states and territories are committed to doing that. , We will continue to work with the states and territories to ensure that we’re getting the best learning outcomes we can for our children this year.

The Guardian reported this week that about 10% of the country’s cases were from that ship. Passengers were allowed to disembark in a decision the NSW health minister now agrees was a mistake. , Fuller is asked who is to blame, Border Force or the NSW health department. He doesn’t really say. , There’s another party in this, which is obviously the captain of the ship and the crew on the ship and whoever made contact with NSW. So I’m looking at that matter as the broader part of the responsibilities coming in. Obviously I wasn’t involved in the operation at that time. But I will go back and look at the 000 calls and the calls from the actual ship itself, and try and get a feeling for what information was provided at the time. I think that’s an important starting point: what information was provided to the NSW government or the federal government., Updated\nat 4.57am EDT\n, \n\n4.51am EDT\n04:51\n\n, NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller is on 7:30. Leigh Sales notes that cruise ships are one of the largest sources of infections in Australia. , Sales: , In New South Wales, 20% of all confirmed cases have come from cruise ships. There are still eight of them in NSW waters, containing nearly 9,000 people. , Sales says there are at least 21 ships carrying thousands of people docked off the coast of Australia. She asks Fuller how testing these people onboard will work. He says: , If anyone is ill on the ships, we need to get them off and we have been doing that regularly, working between the ports authority and the police marine area command and health. In terms of the eight ships we currently have docked or off the coast of NSW, it’s putting our health people on with a third party provider that are experts in this area., Fuller says the cruise companies have indicated they would be willing to sail out of Australian waters if their crews test negative. , Updated\nat 4.54am EDT\n, \n\n4.43am EDT\n04:43\n\n, The PM stresses that the “health advice we have is that there is no health reasons why children can’t go to school”. , Asked if taxes will increase to pay for the government’s massive stimulus funding, Morrison does not address this directly. , Obviously there will be a heightened debt burden as a result of decisions we have had to take. They have been necessary decisions. Otherwise the calamity for Australian households economic will be disastrous. We have taken the decisions of government to step up and to make this commitment to provide people with an economic lifeline over the many months ahead. But you are right, we will have to then work hard on the other side to restore the economy. Now, that’s why we are being so careful not to have things that tie the economy and the budget down off into the future. We do need to snap back to the normal arrangements on the other side of this., Updated\nat 4.47am EDT\n, \n\n4.39am EDT\n04:39\n\n, Morrison says schools have been planning for a “balance – a combination of distance learning” and, for those who can’t “provide a learning environment at home, for the children to be able to return to school”., School will return after the holidays. They just won’t be holidays that most school students have known for a long time. And when they go back, it’s the learning that matters, and we hope to have an arrangement that can return as much to normal as possible. , But we have to accept that there will be, for some protracted period of time, this combination of distance learning, and for those who can’t do that at home, no child should be turned away., Updated\nat 4.43am EDT\ncoronavirus update live news australia nsw victoria queensland qld tas act sa wa nt covid19 latest updates", "label": 0}, "train-258": {"text": "\nTwo cyclists die in separate accidents in New South Wales\n, A 72-year-old woman died in Bathurst and a male cyclist died after being hit by a truck in Leichhardt, Sydney, Australian Associated Press, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 03.33 EDT\n\n, Two cyclists have died in separate accidents on New South Wales’s roads, including a 72-year-old woman who was struck by a car in Bathurst., A male cyclist also died on Thursday afternoon after being hit by a truck in Leichhardt in Sydney., The man died at the scene and the truck driver, who was not injured, was taken to hospital for mandatory testing.

This is Josh Taylor bringing you the main stories on Thursday 2 April., The total number of deaths of patients confirmed to have coronavirus has now reached 24 in Australia after two deaths in Victoria and one in Queensland., The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Australia stands at 5,108, up 244 on the previous day., The federal government is funding half the revenue for 13,000 childcare centres in a $1.6bn package to ensure parents who are working during the pandemic can send their child to childcare. This is on top of the jobkeeper wage subsidy, and is estimated to cover around 1 million workers needing childcare for their children., The existing means testing arrangements are no longer in place, so anyone who is working can access childcare during the pandemic. Those who have pulled their children out of childcare since 23 March can have the gap fee waived to put their children back into childcare after the pandemic., Scott Morrison scraps childcare fees while warning Australia to brace for six months of upheaval, Free childcare: what do the Australian government’s coronavirus changes mean for my family?, IR minister Christian Porter announced temporary changes to modern awards for the period of the crisis, as agreed upon by business and unions. Three of the 121 modern awards were changed in restaurants, hospitality and the clerk award. Workers can now be reclassified as performing one type of duty to performing another, and workers can take longer amounts of leave at reduced pay rates., Workers can now also take two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave., On Tuesday we revealed that there were at least 229 cases outside NSW linked to the cruise ship – according to the health departments of every state and territory. That number will inevitably be higher today, as we’re still waiting for the other states to release their latest numbers., But as of Wednesday, there were 78 in South Australia, and as of Monday, there were 70 in Queensland, 43 in Western Australia, 22 in the ACT, 18 in Victoria, three in Tasmania and two in the Northern Territory. Add that to NSW’s announced 340, and you get 576., From midnight tonight, Queensland will now turn away anyone who is not a resident, or does not fall under one of the exempt reasons, from entering the state. This is a change from the previous policy where people were forced to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, announced on that WA would also be moving to a “hard border” from Sunday night, saying the move would make his state “an island within an island”., NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller has confirmed that the current restrictions in place in the state will remain in operation until the end of June, but after that time he is hoping to relax them, depending on the success in reducing the spread of coronavirus., Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has acknowledged that the restrictions on gatherings might make people feel quite isolated, particularly those who live alone, and has said people who have one or two friends over, observing social distancing, would not be in violation of the new rules. But she said you shouldn’t have strangers around., Victoria is not currently being as generous, but the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, overnight agreed to allow people who do not live with their partner to be allowed to visit them or have them over., On the agenda includes rent relief and what to do about Year 12 exams this year. There has been widespread reports that the government’s approach of suggesting renters and landlords “work it out between yourselves” hasn’t been too successful, with residential landlords demanding to know information such as whether tenants will dip into their super, while commercial landlords are not willing to provide “meaningful relief” to stores forced to shut as a result of the restrictions, according to Retail Food Group., More than 1,200 doctors have signed a letter calling on the government to release asylum seekers being held in detention, including those in hotels who were brought to Australia under the medevac legislation., Doctors and advocacy groups have been in discussions with the minister and his department for more than a week, but these talks have broken down, sources have told the Guardian, with a refusal from the government to consider releasing significant numbers of asylum seekers and refugees into the community temporarily., Australia’s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions, Full Story podcast: when is it legal to leave your home?, Is Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

And it has a strong political motivation., Not all reversions to the old ways will be applauded, and the government won’t have the money to keep emergency schemes going., The snapback is the moment when, for example, parents find childcare is no longer free to them and employers have to return to the old industrial relations battlefield., It is a gauge of the prime minister’s optimism the Covid-19 menace will be defeated, and his apprehensions of how a return to our previous national life will be greeted, that he already is urging voters to accept there will be a change back to pre-pandemic programs., Further, the government wants immediately to smother suggestions the cost of its response will force it into policy positions it has fought against previously – such as elimination of the franking credits tax relief., Morrison told reporters on Thursday that everything old will be back again, saying “there is a snapback to the previous existing arrangements on the other side of this”., The major measures designed to combat the spread of the virus and compensate its financial victims have been built to run for a finite lifetime, to inevitably self-destruct. At a specific time, yet to be determined, they will switch off., But a problem for the government is some of them will leave an imprint on the national debate. One legacy of the crisis, for example, could be a renewed campaigning for a universal basic income, given the temporary precedent of the jobkeeper payments., Industrial relations minister Christian Porter on Thursday seemed to indicated some changes in his area were here to stay., “It probably is fair to say that there has been the type of change in three weeks inside the award system that you might otherwise wait 30 years to see,” Porter told reporters., But the government is insisting nothing is forever., There are no structural changes being made which would last beyond the emergency, Morrison told reporters on Thursday, in a explanation of his strategy and yet another shot at Labor’s handling of the GFC., Referring to decisions 12 years ago, he said: “When we went through this last time there were long tails of expenditure and there were structural changes to expenditure.”, The lingering question is when things will snap back., That moment might not arrive for a year, although the prime minister has repeatedly suggested a six-month schedule, which probably is being dictated by the exhaustion of revenue., By any reasonable forecast Morrison will still be leader when it happens., Voters will have to accept that the big guns of the government responses to Covid-19 have to be retired because the cost of keeping them on the battlefield could not be sustained.morrison

South Wales police have said anchored cruise ships must return to home ports but federal government says it has a duty to provide healthcare, \nAnne Davies , \nDaniel Hurst and \nNaaman Zhou, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 00.54 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 00.12 EDT\n\n, NSW Police’s Marine Area Command has provided an escort for NSW Health and an independent medical team to board the stricken cruise ship, Ruby Princess, off the coast of Sydney earlier Thursday to assess the health of more than 1,100 crew and whether they are infected with Covid 19., The joint operation between Australian Border Force and NSW Police is part of the Australian government’s efforts to deal with at eight cruise ships that are in Australian waters off the east coast and which have ignored an order to leave to their home ports., No police officers boarded the vessel, the police said in a statement., “During today’s joint operation, a 66-year-old crew member was transported from the vessel requiring medical care,” it said., “The NSW Police Force is also assisting with a number of medical evacuations and transfers of Australian crew members from several cruise ships anchored off Sydney,” the police said., NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller, who is in charge of the cruise ship situation in NSW will provide an update on the evolving operation regarding the management of cruise ships on Friday morning., Earlier in the day the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia had an obligation to provide healthcare to people who are sick and within our territorial waters, and that the government would take doctors from a private company to review health of about 8,500 crew, mostly foreigners, are onboard the ships owned by Carnival Cruises and Royal Caribbean., The prime minister said in his midday press conference that the ships off the New South Wales coast had been “visited for the purposes of health checks very, very recently” ., The Australian government ordered the vessels to leave Australia waters during the Covid-19 pandemic but they have so far refused to do so and some sick crew members have had to be medically evacuated to Australian hospitals., Fuller has the final say on who can disembark cruise ships., On Thursday morning Fuller said he feared that “bringing 9,000 people off the cruise ships” could “overload” the state’s health system. “We know around the world that when the hospital systems become overwhelmed, then lots and lots of people die., NSW police also forced another cruise ship, the Pacific Explorer, to leave Sydney harbour and anchor off the coast., Sture Myrmell, the president of Carnival Australia, which operates the Pacific Explorer, said in a statement posted to YouTube that the decision was “particularly sad and disappointing”. , “Being able to send home those crew members who are not required for the safe operation of the ship is the right thing to do both from a humanitarian point of view and Australia’s international standing as a maritime nation that looks after foreign nationals in its care,” Myrmell said., “We remain concerned that it is not safe for the ship to sail away from Australian while there are crew members on board who are ill. , “Australia has maritime obligations to protect the welfare of seafarers and as such we need to care for foreign nationals as we would expect other nations to care for Australians in similar circumstances abroad.”, But Morrison made it clear Australia would honour its international obligations to assist the sick in its waters., “If there are people who are sick and need healthcare, then whether it is a foreign national off our shores or an Australian somewhere else, then countries have been respecting that and that is the position of the Australian government,” he said., “That has been respected, that has been honoured, as recently as we have seen in Western Australia with the cases that are there. We are provisioning those ships, so they will be able to move on their way.”, Support to reach the ships and process any people evacuated is being provided by the defence forces., A defence department spokesman said: “At the request of the New South Wales government, Defence is planning to provide land-based logistics and additional quarantine compliance at some NSW ports in support of NSW police.”, The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said on Thursday that non-Australian residents who were trapped on the ships could be “extracted” and “flown back to their country of origin”., Six crew members from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has now had more than 500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, had already been taken to Australian hospitals after falling ill. It remains off the coast of Sydney with 1,100 crew onboard., Doctors from the private company Aspen Medical will be taken to the seven ships off shore – an eighth is in port in Sydney – to determine how many crew are ill with Covid-19. It is then hoped the ships will depart for their port of origin – usually a flag- of-convenience port such as the Bahamas or Malta.,  Dutton said on Thursday that if ships were free of Covid-19, then it might be possible to send them out to sea or repatriate crew without risk., But he also accused some of the cruise ship companies of misleading authorities about the health of people onboard. “It’s clear that some of the companies have been lying about the situation of the health of passengers and crew onboard, so what we’ve agreed to do with NSW is to look at each of the vessels,” he told 2GB radio., He said the approach might vary from ship to ship. “Some of these ships will move off and go back to their port of origin, some of them we may be able to extract the crew and fly them back to their country of origin, some of them – because they’ve been out there for more than 14 days – there’s no presence of Covid-19 onboard. Others we do have concern about.”, Aspen Medical – a private company that has done work for Princess Cruises, owned by Carnival, in the past – will provide the medical staff., A company spokesman said: “Aspen Medical is operating at a high operational tempo, with a significant amount of work relating to the Covid-19 response, both at home and overseas, including establishing respiratory clinics, emergency departments, infection control training for health professionals and aged care staff and providing screening at Swissotel Sydney., “Our involvement in the Covid-19 cruise ship response began in Tokyo, where we managed the land-based quarantine facility for the crew of the Diamond Princess. Following the success of that operation, we were contracted to undertake similar work onboard the Grand Princess off San Francisco,” he said., The details of the contract with Australian Border Force in relation to cruise ships off the coast was being finalised now, he said.,  The Maritime Union of Australia has urged the federal government to urgently repatriate all crew members, other than those directly responsible for marine operations, to address the growing humanitarian crisis., That would mean bringing crews onshore and organising charter flights to countries such as Philippines, India and China, where many of the crew originate., But the presence of the novel coronavirus will potentially open up a legal quagmire, particularly if the captains of the ship declare their ships in distress or refuse to leave Australian waters. There may also be difficulties getting countries to accept repatriated crew., Dutton said the Australian Border Force commissioner had already issued directions for a number of vessels to depart Australian waters “and we’re working through that with each of the companies now”., But Dutton added: “We’ve also got to be cautious about the fact that if you force these boats to set sail, and they end up having people die or people who are seriously sick by the time they get a couple of hundred nautical miles off the coast, they’d turn around and come back.

Firstly, that Santos set targets aligned to the goals of the Paris agreement for its direct emissions and the indirect “scope 3” emissions released by consumers of its products, and secondly that it review its industry association memberships. The motions received 43% and 46% support at Santos’ annual general meeting , was held online on Friday due to the coronavirus pandemic., Both resolutions were backed by several large proxy advisers and superannuation funds, but opposed by two Chinese shareholders, ENN Ecological Holdings and Hony Capital, that control about 30% of shares., The resolutions were not officially put to the meeting after a push to change the constitution to allow advisory resolutions was unsuccessful, but were acknowledged by Santos’ chairman, Keith Spence, who read out the vote results., The centre’s Dan Gocher said it showed there was strong support for fossil fuel companies to set targets to limit not just their own emissions, but those that result from their goods. He said many of Santos’ peers, including BP, BHP and Royal Dutch Shell, had committed to scope 3 targets., “These results show how much of a laggard Santos is on climate change,” Gocher said., “The onus is now on institutional investors to ensure that their vote is not ignored. Santos should immediately move to implement the review and disclosure measures recommended in the two resolutions.”, Spence told the meeting that while the resolutions had been rejected, it was clear that climate change was an important issue to our shareholders., “It’s something that is personally important to me as well,” he said., “Our company is already taking industry-leading action towards emissions reduction, and we will continue to engage constructively with shareholders on climate change, and work towards our shared aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050 over the coming year.”, Santos has a target of cutting emissions by more than 5% by 2025 and an aspirational goal of net zero emissions by 2050, but aims to lift gas production by 60% over the next five years., Gocher said it was untenable for Spence to maintain his opposition to setting a target for scope 3 emissions “given the clear signal sent by his shareholders”. , Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said oil and gas companies had been told for years that investors expected them to address climate change in line with the Paris agreement., “The question now for Australian companies like Santos and Woodside is whether they are matching their European counterparts, who increasingly recognise that a strategy for a diversified business beyond pure fossil fuel extraction is required to reduce climate risk and provide long-term value for investors,” she said.almost half of all shareholders at santos agm back stronger emissions target", "label": 0}, "train-264": {"text": "\nAustralian news: stories you may have missed during the coronavirus crisis\n, High court to hand down George Pell verdict, water flows into the Menindee Lakes and Victoria renews logging, \nNaaman Zhou, \n\nFri 3 Apr 2020 15.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Apr 2020 17.24 EDT\n\n, As Australia’s coronavirus outbreak continues – but with the cautious optimism of a slowing rate of infection – a lot of important news has slipped under the radar., Here are the stories you may have missed over the past week., The high court will hand down its judgment in George Pell’s final appeal on Tuesday in Brisbane., The final arguments from both sides finished up in March, and we will find out at 10am on Tuesday whether his conviction on five counts of child sexual abuse will be upheld or overturned., The Sydney to Melbourne train that derailed in February, killing two people, was travelling at more than 100km/h in a section limited to 15km/h., That section was part of a diversion, introduced that afternoon, from the normal route with a speed limit of 130km/h, according to the preliminary report on the crash, which came out on Friday., Read the full story here., Chris Dawson formally pleaded not guilty on Friday to murdering his then wife on Sydney’s northern beaches nearly 40 years ago., The former teacher and Newtown Jets rugby league player has repeatedly claimed that Lynette Dawson is still alive and several people have seen her since her disappearance in January 1982.

But they will be with us for a long time, by  Katharine Murphy Political editor, \n\nFri 3 Apr 2020 15.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 18.55 EDT\n\n, We’ve forgotten this now, because this pandemic has unmoored us. New information about the crisis crests by the minute., But back in January, the single biggest health and economic calamity of our lifetimes crept towards us slowly. In Australia, we thought 2020 had delivered its worst when the swathes of the coast and country burned, and cities choked in smoke. As we crept towards the Australia Day holiday, we thought we were about to turn the corner., We were wrong., By the third week of January, the disaster of Covid-19 was escalating at its point of origin. By 21 January, 198 cases of coronavirus were confirmed in the Wuhan region, with three fatalities. Another 19 cases were reported in other regions of China, and a smattering of infections had turned up in Thailand, Japan and South Korea., The distant thunder in Wuhan triggered Australia’s bureaucratic machinery for managing a pandemic. The Communicable Disease Network requested a coordinated national health response on 20 January, and Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, convened a meeting of his state counterparts to discuss developments., The national incident room was activated and Murphy’s group, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, endorsed enhanced border measures for the three direct flights a week between Wuhan and Sydney – but not mass screening at airports. The next day, 21 January, Murphy told journalists this was now a “rapidly evolving situation”. Concern had been heightened by events of the “last three or four days”. There was now evidence of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19., At around the same time that Murphy was briefing reporters, the national women’s soccer team of China passed through Wuhan on the way to Australia. A week later, that team was holed up in quarantine in Brisbane. There was a confirmed case in the state, a Wuhan resident, in isolation at the Gold Coast University Hospital: Queensland’s patient zero. By the end of January, Australia hit seven cases., Queensland was the first state to move. It declared a public health emergency on 29 January. In Canberra, the response was also gathering pace. Morrison told reporters the government would activate Christmas Island as a quarantine area. He also upgraded the travel advice, telling Australians to reconsider all travel to China., But coronavirus was not the prime minister’s only problem. Over those same late summer days, he was easing Bridget McKenzie out of her portfolio after a scathing audit report about the management of sports grants. Easing McKenzie out triggered a toddler tantrum in the Nationals. Barnaby Joyce made a bull run at Michael McCormack. Obscured by the B-grade theatrics, and by the pursuit new facts about sports grants, the looming health crisis continued to build in the background as the Australian parliament roiled throughout February., On the last sitting day of the month, 27 February, Morrison summoned reporters to his courtyard at parliament house and dialled it up to 11. He declared the risk of a global pandemic “is very much upon us”., He initiated the government’s coronavirus emergency response plan. There were now substantial outbreaks in South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. There were cases in Africa, West Asia, Europe and South America. But Morrison was both moving, and soothing. Normal life would go on. “You can still go to the football, you can still go to the cricket, you can still go and play with your friends down the street, you can go off to the concert and you can go out for a Chinese meal.”, A day later, health ministers met in Melbourne. The dominant issue was aged care. A senior official familiar with the discussion on that day insists that only Queensland, which had already declared a health emergency, and New South Wales, had a sharp grasp of what was coming. Victoria was slow, but would come in forcefully later. “There really was no national leadership at that point,” the official says., Morrison and the government would doubtless contest this assessment by pointing to the steady accumulation of action since 20 January. The government was also beginning to talk itself around on the likely need for fiscal stimulus. The first package of measures was in its infancy., But the clear impression from the states in late February, at least at the health intersection point, was Canberra hadn’t yet locked on just how bad the Covid-19 health crisis would ultimately get., In March, the operating tempo would change., Two key events would drag the federation of Australia into the new normal., The Covid-19 pandemic is an extraordinary event. Live coverage throbs day and night. Billions blur into other billions, days become indistinguishable. But in Australia, two incidents in March moved the dial, pushing the management of the crisis into new territory., The first escalation happened on 13 March, when Morrison met the premiers and chief ministers in Sydney for the council of Australian governments. The second major pivot point played out over the following week, culminating in the weekend of 21 and 22 March., The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, gave an inkling of what was to come on 10 March. Standing inside the Royal Melbourne hospital, he warned journalists “extreme measures” were coming. Schools would be closed, entire workforces would be working from home, sporting events would be cancelled. “That time will come,” Andrews said. “We are going to ask a lot of Victorians.”, Two days later, in Canberra, Morrison launched the first fiscal stimulus package, which was predicated on businesses being open, at least in some form, and consumers being able to spend. He told reporters he was confident the targeted measures would be enough to “do the job” of propping up the economy. If more was needed, there was always the budget in May., By the evening of 12 March, the premiers and chief ministers were at Kirribilli House with Morrison for a social gathering ahead of Coag the next day. Some of the leaders noticed when Andrews hung back when others left. The Victorian premier congratulated the prime minister on the stimulus, but predicted government assistance would shortly need to tick over into survival payments. Swathes of the economy were going to have to shut down., Morrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye, By the time the leaders woke the next day and made their way out to Parramatta stadium, which was the venue for the Coag talks, the world had reached 130,000 Covid-19 cases, and more than 4,700 deaths had been recorded. The Italian health system had been overwhelmed. There were more than 1,000 fatalities., Overnight, there was a wipeout on global financial markets. London and Wall Street had recorded their worst trading days since Black Monday in 1987. Donald Trump slapped a travel ban on Europe. When the Australian markets opened, the ASX plunged 7%. The Reserve Bank pumped more than $8bn into short term bank funding. Flight Centre closed 100 stores. The Grand Prix fell over, which triggered a cascade of event cancellations over the course of the day., That Friday felt like pure mayhem. Live coverage could barely keep pace with events. But inside the cavernous football stadium, the Coag meeting started with the preordained agenda. There were briefings from the Reserve Bank of Australia and from Treasury. Murphy, the chief medical officer, also supplied a detailed briefing. The leaders then broke for a cup of tea., Running parallel with the leaders, health advisers from the states were also conferring by teleconference. Murphy was shuttling between the leaders meeting and the teleconference. Victoria, which had recorded the first case of community transmission that Friday, and Queensland, pushed during the discussion for stronger and more urgent action to force social distancing. People familiar with the dynamic in the meeting of medical officers insist it wasn’t a boil over, but the forward-leaning states insisted more was needed. They sought a consensus to craft new, stronger, recommendations to be put to the leaders., Murphy conveyed that shift to the leaders meeting. That news hit the group like a thunderclap. Morrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye. Officials were promptly turfed out of the room and the leaders were left in a huddle, in a cavernous, empty football stadium in western Sydney, to determine what to do next., The table had been set for lunch. Lunch didn’t happen. Tumult happened. But within the hour, entirely on the hop, nine political leaders had invented a new governance structure. No papers, no proposals, no guidance from officials. Morrison suggested they manage the crisis by convening regularly as a national cabinet. The proposal materialised in the room. The states agreed and insisted the group just be them, first ministers – no opposition leaders., The group created an emergency national government of nine. Morrison later bolted in the national cabinet as a subcommittee of the regular cabinet., The leaders then moved to the discussion about imposing new limits on crowds, and how that would be announced to the public. There was a debate about when the proposed restriction should commence. Now, or Monday? Did people need to be given notice given it was now mid-afternoon on a Friday and events were scheduled for the weekend? There was a view some notice was required., Morrison war gamed in the leaders huddle about whether going to the opening game of the NRL season on Saturday night – something the prime minister had been foregrounding for days – would be a good or a bad signal. Would people be unsettled if he suddenly wasn’t going? The leaders resolved the position they would telegraph, and emerged, and Morrison announced there would be a ban on non-essential gatherings of 500, effective Monday. The prime minister said he’d be going to the football on Saturday night because there was no cause for alarm, and “it might be the last game I get to go to for a very long time”., The day wasn’t yet over. Shortly after the leaders scattered, there was another bombshell. The home affairs minister Peter Dutton had been infected with the virus, likely during a trip to America. That news broke in the early evening, raising alarm about whether the prime minister and other key cabinet ministers had been exposed to the illness, and may need to self-isolate., A small frenzy ensued, particularly when photographs emerged of Dutton grinning next to Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump. The story bounced quickly into American news outlets., By 7.30pm on Friday night, Morrison was not going to watch his beloved Sharks., The rapid recalibration at Coag was the first of two gear changes. The next one played out over the following weekend., Covid-19 is a health crisis that has triggered the most profound economic shock since the global financial crisis. Morrison has told colleagues the impact of this pandemic will be more far-reaching than the Depression. As the world wobbles, Australia is worried about failed states, and the risk of a global sovereign debt crisis., The national government is responsible for economic wellbeing. This crisis has triggered a legitimate dialogue between the tiers of government about protecting lives and livelihoods; how to craft public health measures that save lives without deepening an economic crisis that would threaten wellbeing in other ways. Morrison wanted to craft measures that would enable Australia’s economy to move into a period of hibernation, and he wanted to sequence the inevitable health restrictions to flatten the curve of infections with bursts of significant fiscal firepower., The economic response to this crisis is massive, as it was a decade ago during the global financial crisis. The Morrison government is drawing on the central bank, on the Council of Financial Regulators, on the retail banks, on big corporates, on coordination commissions. Public servants are being redeployed to frontline agencies. Sacked call centre workers are being picked up by Centrelink, and working in contact-tracing call centres in the states. Morrison and Frydenberg are talking regularly to their counterparts overseas., While the economy is largely Canberra’s problem, the states manage health systems, and there was concern in the two most populous states that tough restrictions necessary to stop infections were not moving fast enough. Which brings us to the events of the weekend of 21 and 22 March., The Ruby Princess, the boat two Coalition governments failed to stop, would cause a spike in infections, It was this weekend where the inevitable tension in the federation between saving jobs and preventing unmanageable numbers of ICU patients reached its peak, and manifested publicly as sonic boom Sunday., The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, had endured a terrible few days. Passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship had been allowed to disembark and disperse around the country even though some were already ill with Covid-19., That was a total fiasco, and it triggered inevitable blame-shifting and finger-pointing between NSW Health and Border Force in Canberra. The Ruby Princess, the boat two Coalition governments failed to stop, would cause a spike in infections over the coming week., Sydneysiders also flocked en masse on Saturday to Bondi beach, taking advantage of the glorious early autumn weather. Social distancing was nowhere in evidence, and by Sunday, the number of Covid-19 cases in Australia sprinted past 1,000. A tipping point had been reached., In Canberra, Morrison was hunkered down with colleagues finalising the government’s second stimulus package. The plan was to unveil the $66bn worth of new measures on Sunday. Journalists were briefed late on Saturday so stories could appear in the Sunday papers and on the political shows., But in Sydney and Melbourne, Berejiklian and Andrews were alarmed. They felt public health restrictions needed to be imposed more quickly, because people were ignoring polite entreaties from politicians and chief medical officers. Canberra was not blocking action, but a dialogue about how hard to go with social distancing restrictions that would force businesses to close remained unresolved., Berejiklian and Andrews were in touch throughout Saturday, into Saturday night and then again Sunday morning. Berejiklian told Morrison on Saturday night that NSW and Victoria wanted to implement the first stage of restrictions pronto – the closure of places like pubs and clubs. She said the two states were prepared to move ahead of other jurisdictions if there wasn’t prompt consensus through the national cabinet., Not all states were persuaded that it was time to force widespread lockdowns, and worried they would be dragged along in the slipstream when there wasn’t a solid evidence base. Politically it would be hard for premiers to explain to their constituents why some states were moving and they were not. One official from another state says: “We were moving ahead of the health advice, and all the political pressure is to go further; to be out in front of this”., The story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet, But the ACT was fully on board with the NSW/Victoria view that stage one lockdowns had to happen, and now. The chief minister, Andrew Barr, noted there could not be one rule for Canberra and another for Queanbeyan. A leaders meeting scheduled originally for Tuesday had been brought forward to Sunday evening., The two premiers were not mucking around. Morrison was in his courtyard in Canberra about two-thirds of the way through unveiling stimulus round two when a reporter from the Nine Network asked the prime minister to comment on a new push by NSW and Victoria “for a total shutdown on non-essential businesses”. The story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet, and the news channels were broadcasting live., Morrison was not pleased by the political firebomb, but he ploughed on. He responded by saying he would be guided by the health advice that was currently being prepared by the chief medical officers. If he had a view, he would be expressing it in the national cabinet, not on the hop to journalists. “That’s the orderly and calm way to deal with these things, and to make decisions in a responsible manner.”, Public statements from the two states followed confirming that was in fact the position: restrictions needed to happen, and they were prepared to go in advance of others. Victoria upped the ante by signalling it would close schools from Tuesday. The national cabinet had been jolted into more urgency on the health side. The view in the states intent on pushing the envelope was this was a necessary jolt, delivered just in the nick of time., Later that night, after the national cabinet discussion, Morrison fronted the cameras and confirmed pubs and clubs would close. Restaurants and cafes would be restricted to takeaway only. Schools, confusingly, seemed to be both open and closed., Given the obvious tumult of the day, Morrison also felt compelled to affirm the national cabinet had not splintered. The self-created government of nine had mauled, inelegantly, to a point of consensus. It has weathered its first big test. “All of its members are very committed to its processes and decisions,” the prime minister said., This pandemic is close. It casts a shadow. “We are all next to it,” Josh Frydenberg tells Guardian Australia while downing a late dinner in his Canberra digs one night this week. As the treasurer was working up the third economic support package in as many weeks – the $130bn for wages subsidies the government unfurled early this week – his cousin was seriously ill in intensive care in a Melbourne hospital. Frydenberg’s cousin had picked up the virus during a trip to London with his wife, and soon succumbed to a high temperature and breathing difficulties. Fortunately, he is now recovering well., After the watershed weekend in March, the public health restrictions have only gathered pace. Stage one was followed quickly by stages two and three. One of the recent national cabinets decreed that gatherings would go from 10 to two. Some insiders say the health advice going into the meeting was to maintain the restriction at 10, but leaders defaulted to two. Queensland pushed for one of the more recent measures – quarantining returning travellers in hotels. The state argued that particular measure would have the biggest positive impact on infection rates without inflicting more pain on the general community., Messaging at the beginning was confusing, and at times contradictory. But the public health messaging has become simpler, and more forceful. Stay home, unless there is a very good reason to go out. The commonwealth meanwhile keeps rolling out economic support. Wages subsidies. Free childcare, at least for some. Support for tenants and landlords., The new normal is uncomfortable. It is disconcerting. Gathering places that once teemed with life are empty. States are walled off. The businesses still open wonder when they will have to close their doors. The federal parliament is only sitting in short sessions to pass specific measures. Liberty has been curtailed by emergency powers now in place across all the states and territories, enforced by state police. It is reasonable to wonder how long the public will consent to these arrangements. Australia is a vibrant, noisy, democracy, not a police state., Things feel grim, because they are grim. The suspension of ordinary existence is absolutely necessary in the service of saving lives, but we have entered a new normal that could persist not for six months, which is the timeframe invoked most regularly by political leaders, but for a year. Or two., Governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially, The medical profession remains on the fence about whether the governments of Australia are currently getting the balance right. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, tells Guardian Australia that can only be judged with the benefit of hindsight. “The truth of the matter is governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially,” Bartone says., “We can raise all number of reasons about why that’s the case including mixed messaging, poor information and communication, and indifference by younger sections of the community who thought it was an old person’s disease and they didn’t have to worry. For all those reasons, governments have had to take the community on a conversation.”, Bartone also cautions against some of the optimistic commentary that has emerged over the course of the past week that Australia has begun to flatten the curve of new infections. “We are flattening it but remember that also, we had a big spike in numbers last week and previously because half the Australian population abroad returned home before the lockdowns.”, “You’d expect a bump,” Bartone says. “You worry whether that flattening is actually a true flattening or whether we came off a high base, but there is still an underlying trend that needs to be flattened.”, Andrews brushes off commentary that Morrison was too slow to act on the health impacts. “I think the PM is doing a fantastic job in very very difficult circumstances. I sent him a text the other night to say no prime minister in our lifetime has had to face down something as significant as this, and that national cabinet is working extremely well, and this was a fantastic suggestion from him and we are all very grateful to be acting as one government almost, if you like, across the country rather than nine of us doing our own thing.”, He says the federation creates a tension reflecting divided responsibilities. “There is that tension, that’s perfectly healthy and appropriate. It’s a big thing to close businesses and see people stood down. These are massive decisions to make and there is a very big toll that comes with that including anxiety and all sorts of other issues, often tragic issues, like increased family violence rates for instance and all sorts of other mental health considerations. It’s not a bad thing that we are all grappling with that very difficult choice, trying to smash the virus and trying to preserve the economy as much as we can.”, Barr says the ad hoc government of nine is learning on its feet. “We are getting there now but we weren’t quite there initially around fully appreciating how much the health curve would impact on the economic outcome. I think that gap is now being closed., “There’s been a few things that in hindsight you would like to have got there a week to 10 days earlier, but we have got there, sometimes just in time. What I would like to see in the next phase of this is we are not playing catch-up so much; that we are shaping the future a bit more rather than reacting to the past.”, Barr insists the national cabinet has brought out the best in the federation, and could, in fact, be a segue to a newer, more effective style of politics and governance. “This mechanism has forced cooperation that we haven’t seen before. The level of information sharing is much improved from the case before., “If you were observing that national cabinet from outside and you knew nothing about Australian politics you wouldn’t know which side of the fence people were on. If you’d said to me three weeks ago Newstart would be doubled, we’d have a significant wage subsidy scheme that is effectively a guaranteed minimum income, that private health would be enlisted in the public system in this way, that there would be talk of nationalising certain industries, people would have thought you were crazy, but this is a once-in-a-century health and economic crisis that required consensus decision-making and more centrist policy outcomes.”, We are asking so much of so many … it is so frustrating not to be able to give people an end point, Morrison warned Australians this week we are in this for the long haul. “It will be months. We need to make changes that we can live with and that we can implement day after day, week after week, month after month.”, Andrews is even blunter about the prognosis., There is no obvious end point to this crisis, at least not until there is a vaccine. “The most frustrating thing about this is not being able to give people an end date. We are asking so much of so many, taking extraordinary steps, it is so frustrating not to be able to give people an end point.”, Nobody, he says, is going to the football or for an overseas break for the foreseeable future. “Things like international travel and restrictions on larger gatherings are going to be with us for a long time and that vaccine is some way off. , “Are we going to have many international students at universities across Melbourne and Victoria next year?

They are social distancing. They are staying close in their suburbs and that is what we need people to do,” Palaszczuk said., However the premier encouraged the public to stay disciplined for the long haul., “The evidence is telling me we are about two to three weeks behind New South Wales and the peak could be in July, August or September,” she said., “I know this is a lot of change to take in but we’re all going through it together., “If we get through this over the next six months, I hope to see that things can start returning to some kind of normality.”, The government has confirmed that despite border closures, the Easter bunny has been granted an exemption. , The majority of cases are patients who have travelled overseas or had direct contact with a confirmed case who had travelled overseas., Updated\nat 4.30am EDT\n, \n\n4.15am EDT\n04:15\n\n, The NSW Health statement – which is very, very long – appears to be in response to a story from Nine News., Among other things, the authority says that it was notified by the Ruby Princess of “104 acute respiratory infections on board of which 36 people had presented to the ship’s clinic with influenza like illness”. , Nine reported tonight that NSW Health cleared the Ruby Passengers to disembark, citing emails obtained by the network that say NSW Health assessed the Ruby Princess as “not requiring onboard health assessment in Sydney”., “You are free to disembark,” the email to the Ruby Princess’s physician adds. , #EXCLUSIVE: Nine News can reveal a chain of emails that prove NSW Health knew of the risk of #coronavirus onboard the Ruby Princess, yet still allowed passengers to disembark and go home. @cokeefe9 #COVID19 #9News pic.twitter.com/m4WonzOIYV, NSW Health said that the ship had reported that there were “104 acute respiratory infections of which 36 people had presented to the ship’s clinic with influenza like illness”. , The authority said that these numbers “fell short of the definition of an ‘outbreak’.”, It said: “The Commonwealth Department of Health protocol on managing novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19 risk from cruise ship) states ‘provided there are no concerns about the Covid-19 risk profile of the ship or suspected Covid-19 cases reported … the ship may be allowed to continue voyage while samples are tested’.”, NSW Health said of the emails obtained by Nine News that the “illness and test results identified on board was consistent with influenza., “This is reflected in email correspondence between NSW Health and the ship’s doctor on the Ruby Princess who confirmed influenza was circulating on the cruise. However, in two sick patients referenced in the email, although they had tested negative to influenza, the cause of their respiratory infection was consistent with influenza for which they were receiving treatment.”, Updated\nat 4.19am EDT\n, \n\n3.59am EDT\n03:59\n\n, NSW Health has issued a statement defending its handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship., The statement says there have been 342 confirmed cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in NSW from passengers who were on board the Ruby Princess cruise ship, and 11 probable cases of secondary transmission. , In a lengthy statement, the authority says that transmission among these passengers “could not have been prevented by NSW Health staff”., “No cases of COVID-19 were identified on board the ship before it docked,” a spokesperson said. , “The vast majority of these passengers reported they did not develop symptoms until after leaving the Ruby Princess.” , The Guardian reported this week that about 10% of all cases in Australia were from passengers on board the cruise ship. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, have both been under pressure to explain why passengers were allowed to disembark the ship. , Defending its handling of the situation, NSW Health said passengers were advised to self-isolate for 14 after leaving the ship. , “International experience shows Covid-19 can rapidly spread among passengers if left on board, so self-isolation at home is a much safer option than leaving passengers on board,” the spokesperson said. , “NSW Health had prepared plans in the event Covid-19 being identified on a cruise ship., “On this particular voyage, it was known that influenza activity had been identified on the ship.” , The spokesperson said that a risk assessment process showed that it was preferable to remove passengers from the ship., “Rapid influenza tests identify only a proportion of people who actually have the infection, meaning some people return a negative result even though they are infected with the flu,” the spokesperson said. , “The illness and test results identified on board was consistent with influenza.” , Updated\nat 4.04am EDT\n, \n\n3.15am EDT\n03:15\n\n, #Peru has imposed gender-based movement restrictions.

This behaviour has been strongly condemned by Premier @DanielAndrewsMP. #9News pic.twitter.com/HBwFKyy6Rg, \n\n2.19am EDT\n02:19\n\n, After saying that WA’s trajectory as far as Covid-19 cases goes is promising, McGowan turns to rental arrangements. He says he will make announcement on this soon but says “rents will need to come down” for commercial tenants. , Work is continuing through the national cabinet on new commercial tenancy regulations. We hope to come to a resolution next week on this. It is important we have commercial rents reflect the commercial realities of today. Many tenants, many businesses, have had their incomes collapse. Commercial rents should reflect that simple fact. Rents will need to come down – it’s as simple as that. We will work through the detail and make an announcement soon. , The Prime Minister has said that we want a moratorium on evictions and I support that. That doesn’t mean those businesses who are still in a position to pay rent stop paying rent. But this initiative is about looking after the little guy. We need to be kind and be compassionate to our tenants. We encourage landlords to work with their tenants to come up with a workable and practical outcome that reflects the economic reality of today. Those discussions should already be occurring., Updated\nat 2.27am EDT\n, \n\n2.15am EDT\n02:15\n\n, McGowan stresses that Western Australians who are outside the state need to return before Sunday (when the border closes). , He addresses the details here: , After the deadline, West Australians will only be allowed back into the state if they meet one of the exemptions. The Police Commissioner or his delegate will be the final decision-maker, including on specific compassionate grounds. I do want to clarify one element now for those West Australians currently in forced hotel quarantine over east. Under our border closure if a WestAustralian is self-isolating in an eastern states hotel under a direction, an exemption will apply. For them to return home to WA directly from that hotel, after they have completed their 14 days of quarantine. They would then be required to self-isolate for a further 14 days in Western Australia., Updated\nat 2.24am EDT\n, \n\n2.13am EDT\n02:13\n\n, As he did yesterday, McGowan acknowledges that WA’s decision to close its borders will frustrate people., But he says the trade off will be worth it. , “We have an advantage here inWestern Australia – it is our isolation from the rest of Australia. It would be irresponsible of me as premier not to use our best advantage in this fight.” , Updated\nat 2.14am EDT\n, \n\n2.12am EDT\n02:12\n\n, McGowan begins by acknowledging the death of a passenger from the Artania cruise ship. That takes the national death toll to 28., “Sadly, a male in his 60s passed away last night at Joondalup health campus after testing positive for Covid-19.”, ABC has reported that the man was a foreign national. , Updated\nat 2.23am EDT\n, \n\n2.10am EDT\n02:10\n\n, Thanks to Michael for his efforts today.

To leave them in a situation where their already fragile health is further imperilled is just cruel,” Amnesty International Australia refugee advisor, Dr Graham Thom, said.,  Medical experts have advised the government that these people pose no risk at all if they are housed in the community., Professor David Isaacs, clinical professor in paediatric infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, wrote a letter – signed by more than 1,200 medical professionals – to the home affairs minister, urging the government to free those held in detention., “Social distancing measures which are being required of the rest of us simply aren’t possible in Apods where we have evidence of people being crowded in rooms of 20 or more people for extended periods of time.”, “While the response to Covid-19 needs to be speedy and by nature restrict movement, it shouldn’t come at the expense of the most vulnerable people in our community, nor should it be at the expense of Australia’s obligation to upholding basic human rights, like the right to health,” Professor Isaacs’ letter said.,  Moz, an Iranian refugee held for seven years in PNG and medevacced to Australia for respiratory care, said detainees in Apods were held inside, in cramped conditions, 24 hours a day.,  “There is no space for social distancing. The guards come and go and do not have masks or anything. I am terrified of what will happen in here, and also worried for the health of Australians if this becomes a Covid-19 hotspot.”,  Talks between refugee advocacy groups and government on the temporary release of detainees into the community – to live with their families or with advocates who had volunteered to house them – have broken down. The government is planning to move some detainees from detention centres to Apods, taking over larger and larger parts of city hotels., Updated\nat 2.06am EDT\n, \n\n1.59am EDT\n01:59\n\n, The senior executives at La Trobe University in Melbourne have announced they’ll take a 20% pay cut, with half of that to go to a fund for students affected by the pandemic. The university estimates it is facing an estimated loss in revenue of between $120m and 150m in 2020. , La Trobe University's Senior Executive Team has taken a 20% voluntary pay cut. 10% will go to an emergency fund set up for students in crisis that has already delivered $900,000 to students in need. https://t.co/XOnfgGQ0bQ, Updated\nat 2.03am EDT\n, \n\n1.36am EDT\n01:36\n\n, Queensland Health has confirmed it has 39 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, raising the state’s total to 873.

He did not exclude further measures, without nominating them., The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, struck a less optimistic note, warning people not to “get carried away” because although the rate of infection had slowed we were “not out of the woods” yet., Andrews told reporters in Melbourne he still believed that “there will be a stage four” – a fuller lockdown leaving only essential services such as grocery stores, petrol and pharmacies open., Morrison told reporters people should be patient, and ordered families not to go away on holiday over the Easter break., He said places of worship would be treated as workplaces which respected the four square metre separation rules over the Easter period. Congregations would not be allowed in but could watch online in some cases., “It means there can be additional people taking part in the celebration of these services, not people going to church,” Morrison said, saying the federal government had consulted religious organisations., Morrison said national cabinet had agreed to allow working-holiday makers to go to rural and regional areas for fruit picking and harvesting work, if they registered and self-isolated for 14 days before doing so., On Wednesday, Labor’s social services spokesperson, Linda Burney, wrote to the government calling on it to extend coronavirus support to temporary visa holders in Australia, who she said were “facing hardship and have no other way to support themselves”., Asked about further measures to support temporary visa-holders, Morrison replied the acting immigration minister, Alan Tudge, would announce further “arrangements” in coming days. Guardian Australia understands these relate to relaxing visa conditions, not a new form of payment or special benefit., The prime minister also was firm with visitors on visas, telling them to go home, and claiming that Australia “must focus on its citizens and its residents”., Morrison said national cabinet had agreed to a code of conduct for commercial tenancies, that will be mandatory for businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million that participate in the jobkeeper program., The code would require a “a proportionality to rent reductions based on the decline in turnover to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants” and mediation if they could not agree., Morrison suggested the principle of proportionality could be achieved in many ways, such as rent waivers, varying the term of the lease, or the rent., Asked why no outcome was announced for residential tenancies, Morrison said the “priority has been on the commercial tenancies given the business issues involved and the many business closures”., Guardian Australia understands that – in addition to a six-month moratorium on evictions for residential tenants in Covid-19-related financial hardship – the states and territories are aiming to waive land tax to encourage residential landlords to offer rent reductions., Under the proposal, landlords that offer rent reductions will be able to share the pain 50/50 with the state or territory government, capped at the amount of land tax they pay., The New South Wales treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, told Sky News it was “challenging in circumstances where every state and territory has different land tax arrangements”., “We’ve all agreed in principle to provide financial support to landlords who pass on rent reductions to their tenants, whether retail or commercial tenants,” he said., “But at the same time … we need to make sure we have a national approach.”, While those conducting church services will be allowed to attend their workplace, Morrison signalled that parliament would meet only “as it needs during the course of the crisis and it will be done promptly” when it returns to consider the third economic support package on Wednesday., Labor is alarmed that parliament has adjourned until August, and the crossbench is increasingly concerned about executive action taken without legislative oversight., In a letter, seen by Guardian Australia, the Greens and much of the crossbench proposed two joint select committees to examine the health and economic responses to Covid-19., Signed by the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, independent MPs Helen Haines, Zali Steggall, Andrew Wilkie and Bob Katter, and the Centre Alliance’s Rebekha Sharkie, Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff, the letter complained they had been “effectively deprived of an important part of our role as parliamentarians”. They warned that “millions of Australians” who did not vote for the major parties were being locked out of decision-making., The Greens believe they have in-principle support from One Nation, which would be enough to establish a Senate committee., Anthony Albanese has said Labor is open to a joint or Senate committee, but the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, has warned it should not be a substitute for regular sittings of parliament., On Friday, Morrison said the government “doesn’t have issues” with proposals to strengthen oversight of the response to Covid-19, suggesting that the “Senate provides very good mechanisms for doing that”.australias major measures to tackle coronavirus are now in place scott morrison says", "label": 0}, "train-268": {"text": "\nPalaszczuk’s Campbell Newman moment: freezing public sector wages in a time of coronavirus\n, Analysis: Move has angered unions who say she has ‘thrown frontline workers to the wolves’ when they are most needed, \nBen Smee, \n\nFri 3 Apr 2020 03.38 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Apr 2020 04.25 EDT\n\n, There are few insults that could be hurled at the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, that would sting more than a comparison to her predecessor., Campbell Newman’s ephemeral stint in power – marked by asset sales and the sackings of thousands of public servants – still provides the rump of Labor’s state electoral strategy., But this week Palaszczuk backed down and took Newman’s advice. In a morning television interview, she announced modest public sector wage increases would be placed on hold. Coronavirus or not, 2020 is an election year in Queensland and the seemingly unscripted comments have angered several unions and placed Palaszczuk on an unfamiliar footing., Many of those in limbo are frontline workers – including health, education and other staff working on the coronavirus response., Those unions say the first they heard the government was considering such a move was when told about Palaszczuk’s comments. Worse for the premier, some even raised the spectre of Newman., “In something more akin to the Newman years, it seems the Labor state government has thrown hardworking frontline essential workers to the wolves at the very time we need them the most,” said Peter Ong, the state secretary of the Electrical Trades Union (ETU)., “Workers risking their lives to keep fellow Queenslanders safe deserve far better from a premier who seems to have gone weak at the knees when attacked by a rabid rightwing media pack, cheered on by a former premier who sacked more than 12,000 public service workers,” Ong said., Public sector energy workers, represented by the ETU, had negotiated a 3% pay increase. About 225,000 public servants, many represented by the Together union are in the process of voting on deals that would give them a 2.5% increase, and some a $1,250 sign-on bonus., Together has not released a statement but information for members on its website questions whether Palaszczuk or the state cabinet has the authority to summarily suspend wage negotiation processes., “The premier made this comment in response to a question regarding a Courier-Mail article that ran yesterday. This article was completely incorrect and motivated by anti-public sector politics,” the information for members says.“Industrial processes cannot be unilaterally (without any discussion) shifted by your employer or a press conference.“There was no consultation prior to this comment. If there is poor consultation about this or about the many important crisis measures Covid-19 has brought to public sector workers then things will not go as well as they should.”, Together said its was calling for an accord that would cover the public sector response to the pandemic, and said there had been recent issues with service closures, protective equipment and safety., For more than a week, Newman had been calling on social media for the public sector to “share the nation’s pain”. Last Thursday, Queensland Labor’s official account responded on Twitter, once again attacking his record on the public service., Wonder which public servants Campbell Newman wants sacked this time? Doctors? Nurses? Teachers? When the LNP was last in, he sacked from all three... https://t.co/1iH3VLAYs3, As premier, Newman marshalled Australia’s largest parliamentary majority and could not win a second term in 2015. Since that time, Newman’s chaotic and unpopular tenure has given Labor its most effective campaign lines.

On the same day, the MyGov website crashed due to demand so significant Robert initially attributed to a cyber attack before backtracking., Another Family Tax Benefit debt letter for $5,700 seen by the Guardian was issued on Tuesday, 31 March, one day after the government announced the jobkeeper wage subsidy program. The listed due date is 29 April. Debt recipients can ask Centrelink to pay the money back over a payment plan., The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said she was pleased the government had “finally” paused welfare debt action., “I was told two weeks ago in the Senate by the Minister for Social Services that debt recovery had been suspended, now two weeks later we have confirmation from Minister Robert,” she said.  “Constituents have been contacting us with debts that were raised against them this week.”, But Siewert said the government should go further, by guaranteeing to suspend all debts raised under the income compliance program, widely known as robodebt., “The government has to guarantee that all robodebts are suspended including people who are on existing payment plans,” she said., The Guardian revealed last week the government has been working on a secret plan to repay hundreds of thousands of Australians under the botched robodebt program., The government declined to comment on the leaked plan, citing an ongoing class action against the scheme., Services Australia has paused new debt reviews under the robodebt program, but has been continuing to finalise existing reviews, the Guardian understands., People who have welfare debts against their name can be barred from accessing advance payments, which are available to social security recipients in financial distress., Hank Jongen, a Services Australia spokesman, said the debt pause would apply to a “broad range of debt raising and recovery activities, including those connected to social security payments, Family Tax Benefit and Child Care Subsidy”., “Activities that will cease include referrals to external collection agencies, as well as the garnisheeing of tax refunds,” he said., “During the pause we are not asking customers to commence repaying money they owe to the agency except where it relates to fraud or serious non-compliance., “All open reviews under the online income compliance programme will also cease unless customers choose to continue their review.

This is Josh Taylor bringing you the main stories on Friday 3 April., The rate of the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus has continued to slow in single digits, passing over 5,300 confirmed cases in Australia on Friday., Two more deaths were recorded in Victoria and New South Wales., Australia’s chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, said he was “quietly pleased” with the numbers slowing, but community transmissions had been growing. There are now 300 community transmission cases in Sydney, 60 in Melbourne and 30 in Brisbane., The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the national cabinet is moving from a phase of reacting to slow the spread of the virus to reviewing the measures put in place around restrictions and support. Morrison said if the rate had continued as it was a few weeks ago there would now be 10,000 cases, almost twice the current number., Morrison said after this phase, the national cabinet would move into a recovery phase., The national cabinet has yet to agree to an industry code of practice between businesses and their landlords.

But the South Australian government has said it will not move people “at this time”., The Anangu-Pitjantjatjara-Yankunytjatjara art centres (APYACC) have been lobbying for three weeks to have the SA government support a plan to transport a group of senior people from their remote communities into isolation at the Wiltja Anangu school in Adelaide., APYACC says border closures aren’t working, with people still crossing in and out on remote roads, and elderly people are living in overcrowded housing alongside several generations of family., “Social distancing is a luxury we do not have,” elders at one of the APYACC art centres wrote to the SA government this week., “During the past week, our communities have seen an influx of estranged family members sent back from the cities as part of the government’s strategy of returning Aboriginal people to their communities,” the elders at Mimili art centre wrote., “Already crowded houses are now beyond capacity as we try to accommodate the newcomers, many of whom have a recent history of substance abuse and associated challenges., “Self-isolation and best practice hygiene are not an option in this environment., “It feels like our people have been herded up and locked down in communities where facilities, housing and medical support are severely lacking.”, Prof Paul Torzillo is a leading respiratory and intensive care physician at Sydney’s RPA hospital, and medical director of Nganampa Health Council (NHC), which operates seven clinics in the APY region., Torzillo says moving elders into Adelaide is a “difficult problem” but Nganampa would support it, if a number of “absolute preconditions” were met., “They would be moving from what is currently a very low prevalence location, to a location where there is already community transmission,” he said. “However, you have to balance against that the fact that once there is community transmission these people will be very susceptible, and it will be incredibly difficult to offer them medical care because of all the logistical constraints on the APY lands. In a city they would at least have some chance of getting hospital care., “We would support this, provided they are safely transported, they have guaranteed accommodation for the rest of the year and the building is secured, and they’re under a public health act that would prevent them either leaving or having visitors., “There is a very narrow window through which this can be done., “Once we’ve got community transmission in the lands, these people are at significant risk. So if this were going to to happen, it needs to happen quickly. But it can only happen if all those preconditions are met and the people themselves understand they won’t have any visitors and they won’t be able to leave once they get there,” he said., But the SA government has rejected the plan so far., “Current public health advice relating to Covid-19 is that it is safer for Aboriginal people to remain in their communities. Therefore the South Australian government does not support the movement of Anangu off the APY lands at this time,” a SA government spokesperson said., “The spread of Covid-19 and the government’s response to it is being constantly reassessed, with additional measures being put in place as needed based on public health advice., “Active planning is taking place to protect particularly vulnerable members of remote Aboriginal communities.”, Naccho, the peak body representing Aboriginal community controlled health organisations in Australia, fully supports the plan., “The SA government must listen and act on the advice of the organisers of the evacuation and stop dismissing them,” Naccho CEO Pat Turner said., “Shared and equal decision making is essential to resolve this impasse. SA Health has been too slow to activate this matter. I as CEO fully support the wishes of the elders themselves and fully respect their right to decide.”, Turner also renewed calls for the army to help combat the virus in Aboriginal communities., “Everyone in leadership roles on the APY lands have strongly advocated for many weeks and would welcome the presence of the Australian army and that should be negotiated in terms of actual resource requirements and roll out immediately,” Turner said., “Governments must resource the provision of a professional health workforce to be present on the lands, full supplies of all PPE, isolation facilities, rapid testing and results regime, and treatment facilities for handling COVID., “This is needed in all our communities,” she said.indigenous elders ask to be evacuated from remote communities over coronavirus fears", "label": 0}, "train-272": {"text": "\nQueensland bolsters border closure with barriers and checkpoints to keep coronavirus at bay\n, After some locals labelled the border closure a ‘detour’, Queensland police are now enforcing a ‘hard closure’ to dismay of twin towns residents, \nBen Smee, \n\nFri 3 Apr 2020 00.39 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Apr 2020 00.57 EDT\n\n, The great wall of Coolangatta is about a metre high, constructed of hollow plastic and filled with water. The barriers now stretch across the eight suburban back streets, at the formerly invisible line separating neighbours in New South Wales and Queensland., Last week, Queensland had the world’s most porous closed border; restricted for the first time since the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919, but locals described the relatively lax measures as a “detour”. Suburban border roads were mostly not blocked or closed to avoid causing disruptions to daily life., On Friday, the entwined twin towns of Coolangatta and Tweed Heads were wrenched apart by the red-orange and white barriers and police enforcing the “hard closure” at three checkpoints., Police spoke with most cars crossing the border and asked for identification and documents to prove they had a valid exemption. Papers, please., Officers also boarded buses heading north and, in at least one instance, removed a backpacker who had been trying to enter Queensland from Byron Bay., During morning peak hour, traffic was backed up for about 2km., More Qld / NSW border closures tonight at Coolangatta as Qld Gov now makes it tough to enter unless you essential services, work over the border, a transport driver or have a permit. pic.twitter.com/cstfHhjBTX, In any other year, this Friday would have been among the busiest days for travellers heading to the Gold Coast. School holidays are scheduled to begin on Saturday, and the mild post-summer break on the coast’s beaches can be as busy as the Christmas period. Two years ago on Saturday, the Commonwealth Games began on the glitter strip., Those famous long stretches of surf and sand have also been the subject of police enforcement in recent days., The police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, said on Friday they would begin to fine people for breaking rules about public gatherings, or who lingered on the beach without excuse., “You can attend the beach to go for an exercise or a swim, but don’t sunbake or congregate,” Carroll said. “Activities like sunbaking ... should not be taking place.”, Carroll said that by midday on Friday police had inspected more than 4,000 cars at border checkpoints and turned back 75 people from interstate who did not have an exemption to enter Queensland., The state disaster coordinator, deputy police commissioner Steve Gollschewski, said police were “very pleased” with the levels of compliance., On the ground, though, locals were processing the reality of dividing what they consider a single community., Brooke Smith lives at Terranora, a New South Wales community near the border on the Tweed River. She told Guardian Australia her husband works in Sydney and would typically return for weekends via the Gold Coast airport at Coolangatta. (The airport’s runway is mostly in New South Wales, but the terminal is in Queensland)., “In non-apocalyptic circumstances he flies into Coolangatta. We haven’t seen him since March 22 and I don’t anticipate we’ll see him until Good Friday and in that case he’ll drive home., “I think it’s ridiculous, everyone seems to be doing the right thing, except for Queensland when they had their elections last weekend,” Smith said., “If they closed the beaches then people would have no reason to swap states to go in. The Tweed and Coolangatta is one big community. My favourite restaurants are in Coolangatta. I’m one of the fortunate ones, I still have a job and I could put that back into the local community.”, One Tweed Heads resident, Michael, said some locals were parking in streets near the border and walking around the barriers., “The barriers are at the end of my street,” he said. “Two cars can barely pass each other at the best of times, so I don’t think there’s too many caravans going to come through there. It’s annoying but I guess we understand why they’re doing it.”, For others, the roadblocks were barely a hindrance., A motorist driving a NSW-plated car, heading from Ducat Street, Tweed Heads, towards Kirra was photographed mounting the kerb and crossing the border along the footpath. Police said they were investigating the incident.queensland bolsters border closure with barriers and checkpoints to keep coronavirus at bay", "label": 0}, "train-273": {"text": "\nChris Dawson pleads not guilty to murdering his wife Lynette in 1982\n, The 71-year-old former Sydney teacher entered his plea at the NSW supreme court on Friday, Australian Associated Press, \n\nFri 3 Apr 2020 00.36 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Apr 2020 02.45 EDT\n\n, Chris Dawson has formally pleaded not guilty to murdering his then-wife on Sydney’s northern beaches nearly 40 years ago., The former teacher and Newtown Jets rugby league player has repeatedly claimed that Lynette Dawson is alive and several people have seen her since her disappearance in January 1982., The 71-year-old entered his plea when he appeared in the New South Wales supreme court for the first time on Friday., Dawson was emotionless as he was arraigned.

They will be forgotten about and left to die due to old age, because they will attend to the younger generation first., “I definitely think our mob and our community have been forgotten about., “I’m disappointed with our local shire, who supposedly run our town, for not putting things in place for our community., “They have held one meeting that I know of and that was at the direction from our Coonamble Aboriginal Health Service to stakeholders to call a meeting about Covid- 19, but they didn’t invite any elders to speak on the First Nations people who are the most vulnerable to catch this virus.”, The World Health Organization has warned that PPE is critical in any effort to stop the spread of the virus. It has called on nations to lift their domestic production by 40% and end export restrictions., The Orange Aboriginal Medical Service, in NSW’s central west, says it is attempting to conserve PPE as much as it possibly can, with face masks and sanitiser the items of highest need., The service typically orders PPE monthly. It put in an order two weeks ago for new stocks, but the supplier said it was unable to give any ETA for when the equipment would arrive., Chief executive Jamie Newman said the service had been given an interim supply of PPE by its peak body, and was now trying to reduce demand by moving as much of its services into telehealth as possible and sending administrative staff to work from home., “It’s about changing our business,” Newman said. “Whether it’s three months, six months, or six weeks, we have to be smart business-wise in how we maintain resources, client care, and looking after our own staff.”, The shift to telehealth had been aided by this week’s federal government announcement of a $500m telehealth package, which had made it more viable for GPs., “Like most other services, we’ve got limits on what we can be supplied with,” Newman said. “I suppose it’s up to every Aboriginal medical service in the region, the state, and the country, about what level of service we can provide, and the majority of that is through telehealth.”, “We’re trying to keep our hospitals from being overinflated with numbers, because if people can’t get that level of health care through a general practice or an Aboriginal Medical Service, they’re going to be flooding the hospitals, or they’re going to be at home suffering., “That’s the last thing we want to see happen.”aboriginal health services warn of catastrophic shortage of coronavirus protective equipment", "label": 0}, "train-275": {"text": "Victoria XPT crash: train was doing more than 100km/h in 15km/h zone, report confirms, Sydney to Melbourne XPT that crashed in February failed to observe notice diverting it onto a loop with much lower speed limit before derailment, A train that derailed in Victoria, killing its driver and pilot, entered a section of track where the speed limit was 15km/h at more than 100km/h., The speed limit for the passing loop near Wallan, north of Melbourne, had been imposed after the diversion of rail traffic from a main line., The speed has been confirmed in a preliminary report on the 20 February crash, released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau on Friday., “The train was not able to negotiate the turnout to the loop track at this speed and derailed.

There’s a lot of worry that goes on,” he said., On Kangaroo Island, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy built a 13.5 hectare predator-proof fence for Kangaroo Island dunnarts, an endangered marsupial experts feared had been pushed to the brink of extinction by the fires., But plans for a much larger 370 hectare fence have been put on hold. The organisation’s chief executive, Tim Allard, said staff were having to be more “innovative” to keep some of their other programs, such as fire management in Western Australia’s Kimberley region, going., The New South Wales and South Australian governments said where possible they were continuing work with smaller teams travelling to sites in separate vehicles. This includes work on pest and weed management, some wildlife monitoring and emergency food drops for animals., The NSW department of planning, industry and environment said some adjustments had been made to ensure these operations complied with social distancing requirements., The Victorian government provided no specifics on how Covid-19 was affecting its recovery work, supplying only a statement saying work “is continuing, to protect our native wildlife and biodiversity” in line with advice from the state’s chief health officer., Lisien Loan, the director of conservation and wildlife for South Australia’s environment and water department, said teams had been able to do a lot of immediate work after fires on Kangaroo Island and around Cudlee Creek before the shutdown. Individual landowners are assisting with rabbit control in the Adelaide Hills region, where it complies with social distancing measures., But she said the effects of Covid-19 meant plans to have experts in particular fields do on-ground research had been suspended. That included a plan to get university experts in to survey invertebrate populations, which includes insects, an area where there are large gaps in knowledge., “We’ve done some rapid-assessment work. This is more that next layer of what exactly has been the impact, how many of these things do we think are left in remnant habitat, it helps inform our longer-term work,” Loan said., Sarah Legge, a conservation biologist at the Australian National University, said many standard land-management activities were now difficult to carry on with., “If it prevents rapid assessments, that opportunity to find out if species were affected by fire and being able to identify species that are hanging on by their claws, all of these things are potential negative consequences,” she said., Euan Ritchie, an ecologist at Deakin University, said some “valuable, time-sensitive information” might be missed., “While we all acknowledge and respect the need for the travel restrictions, it’s certainly very frustrating that at the critical time we need to get into the field to monitor species’ and ecosystem responses to and recovery from fire, we’re now in many cases not able to access study sites,” he said., The effects of the Covid-19 response extend beyond the bushfire response into several areas of environmental and scientific research. Long-term monitoring of species, an area that experts have highlighted is in dire need of more funding, is also on hold., It effectively looks like a year where we have no idea what’s happening in our ecosystems, John White, an associate professor in wildlife ecology at Deakin University, has been monitoring the effects of climate change and fire on small mammals in the Grampians national park since 2008., Every year he and a team of researchers spend three months tracking species, compiling data on how they have coped following three major fires since 2006. This year they had been planning to also look for remaining individuals of particular species, such as the long-nosed potoroo. But it won’t go ahead., “It effectively looks like a year where we have no idea what’s happening in our ecosystems,” White said., “The understanding you get following sequences through time is far superior than what you might be able to get by studying an area for two to three years and then leaving.”, A spokesperson for the federal agriculture, water and environment department said the bushfire recovery remained a priority., “The government is continuing to direct funds to the areas of highest priority based on expert advice. Some work is being modified in accordance with current government health advice but we continue to be focused on the challenge,” the department said., Environment groups have expressed concern about the effects of the back-to-back crises of the bushfires and Covod-19. In particular, they are seeking clarity on whether the $50m the government budgeted for wildlife after the fires will still be increased as planned given the enormous financial stimulus required to assist workers and businesses affected by the shutdown., “Looking forward there is an opportunity for economic stimulus spending to intersect with bushfire and wildlife recovery, and once people are able to get into these areas safely, there is potential to create new jobs in land management and ecosystem restoration,” James Trezise of the Australian Conservation Foundation said., A spokesman for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the $50m was “a down payment and there has been a clear commitment to further funding in the future”., The government announced this week that as part of that $50m it would spend up to $12m on a new round of grants for recovery work., “Clearly, Covid-19 restrictions mean that some activities will not be able to start immediately but the process of identifying submissions and planning their role in the recovery process is an important one,” Ley said in the announcement., On Thursday, Wires and Landcare said public donations meant the two organisations were offering $20,000 grants – up to a total of $1m – for community environment groups to do habitat regeneration work. , , , fears for wildlife recovery after bushfires as coronavirus crisis stymies scientists fieldwork", "label": 0}, "train-278": {"text": "\n'Stranger in a hazmat suit': families of Dorothy Henderson Lodge residents try to stay positive\n, As concern grows for people in aged care confined to their room due to coronavirus, some children report their parents are putting on a brave face, \nCalla Wahlquist, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 16.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Apr 2020 17.33 EDT\n\n, After one month of being confined to their rooms, some residents of a Sydney aged care home at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak have been allowed to take a short walk outside., They went one at a time, escorted by an aged care worker. Among them was 68-year-old Christine Fennell, who has been living at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge since last year., She was allowed to take two short supervised walks. It is the most exercise she has had in 30 days, since the first case of coronavirus was detected at the Macquarie Park facility. Since then five of the home’s elderly residents have died after testing positive to Covid-19, and 17 other people – 12 residents and five staff – have also tested positive., Fennell, who has a persistent cough from a lingering chest infection, was tested for the virus on Friday 13 March, although her son, Thomas Wright, has not yet received the result. He assumed no news was good news until he received a letter from the BaptistCare general manager of residential services, Allan Waters, on 3 April, saying the centre had “experienced new cases of residents testing positive to Covid-19 after previously testing negative”., Waters wrote that it was a “concerning situation”. He said the home had been inspected by an infection control specialist that day, who recommended a change when staff wear hospital gowns as part of their personal protective equipment. He also said that 65% of the centre’s regular staff, who had been in self-isolation, were now back at work., The death of the fifth resident, a 95-year-old woman, was reported on Wednesday. Ross Low, the chief executive of BaptistCare, which runs the facility, said the loss was “incredibly difficult, especially knowing just how hard everyone is working to care for our residents and staff”., The same message was sent via text message to family members., BaptistCare declined to answer further questions or participate in an interview with Guardian Australia., The residents themselves are told very little., “When I am calling mum, she does not know these things,” Wright says. “She is hearing this from me. The outside world in her head is still where it was a month ago. She was quite surprised to hear that Sydney is in lockdown.”, The first message of the outbreak came on the afternoon of 4 March. It began: “Dear residents and families of BaptistCare, we are writing to inform that a staff member at Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park, has been confirmed to have the coronavirus.”, The employee was a 50-year-old woman, an aged care worker, who had tested positive the day before. The source of her infection has still not been determined. It was the first case of untraced community transmission in Australia., The message continued that “any staff or residents identified as being at risk are isolated”., That evening Wright says his mother was told not to come to the dining hall for dinner., The next day, 5 March, health authorities in New South Wales confirmed that a 95-year-old woman, who was a resident of the home and had died in hospital on Tuesday night, before the first infection at the home was announced, had also tested positive to Covid-19. The virus had spread – an 82-year-old man and a 70-year-old man had also tested positive., All other residents were confined to their rooms, although Guardian Australia understands that order was not strictly adhered to for several days., A number of the regular staff at the centre did not turn up to work, fearing infection. Apart from close contacts, staff were not immediately told to self-isolate. Some did not receive that order until two days later., Fennell, confined to her small self-contained room, did not receive lunch until 4pm that day when it arrived on a tray carried “by a stranger in a hazmat suit”, Wright says. Her room is next to a kitchen, where she could ordinarily prepare food outside of meal times. But since the outbreak, she has been confined to her room without even the ability to make herself a cup of tea., By Sunday 8 March, an 82-year-old man died, bringing Australia’s death toll from the coronavirus to three. As of Saturday it sat at 30., Dorothy Henderson Lodge is managed in wings or pods, with limited staff movement between wings to limit the spread of ordinary infectious diseases that can spread through an aged care home, like influenza or gastroenteritis. When the virus was first detected centre management locked down the problem wing and isolated staff identified as close contacts of the infected staff member and residents., But the 70-year-old man lived in a different pod to the first reported cases. When he tested positive, it showed the virus had spread despite these efforts to contain it., A spokeswoman from NSW Health says staff from the department visited the lodge on 3 March and “initiated isolation of residents and enhanced infection control precautions among staff”., “There is no evidence that the time taken to identify and notify staff who were close contacts resulted in further transmission of the disease,” the spokeswoman says., The response was perhaps not as swift as it would be if a similar outbreak were reported today. But it was the first week of March: a lifetime ago in Australia’s response to the coronavirus. Overseas travel was still allowed and returning travellers were not told to isolate, only monitor themselves for respiratory symptoms. The magnitude of the crisis had not yet sunk in., “I do think that they BaptistCare were taken, and the sector has been taken, a bit by surprise,” says Ian Yates, the chief executive of Council on the Ageing Australia. “And to some degree they have swung too much the other way. In some places there are no cases at all but they have gone into complete lockdown and not let family visit at all.”, BaptistCare announced it was banning all visitors to all of its homes on 18 March, the same day the federal government said visits to people in aged care homes would be limited to one per day with a maximum of two people. Other nursing homes followed suit in increasing the government’s recommendation to a voluntary visitor ban., There are already reports, says Yates, of people in aged care homes across the country “declining” due to being deprived regular visits or confined to their rooms, with reports of increased mental health concerns and de-cognition.”, “Older people decondition really quickly,” Yates says., Wright says his mother has put a brave face on her isolation – she has learned how to use video conferencing app Zoom and is speaking to him daily., “She has a big pile of DVDs there,” he says. “I am not sure that she has made her way through all of them.”, Gerard Hayes, the secretary of the NSW branch of the Health Services Union, says the aged care sector has acted “much faster to act than the federal government” to shut down homes and protect residents., “The fact we have seen just four aged care facilities in NSW with confirmed cases clearly demonstrates that aged care workers are doing an incredible job at keeping vulnerable residents safe,” Hayes says.stranger in a hazmat suit families of dorothy henderson lodge residents try to stay positive", "label": 0}, "train-279": {"text": "'Like preparing for war': Australia's hospitals brace for coronavirus peak, \n'Like preparing for war': Australia's hospitals brace for coronavirus peak\n, Health workers from densely populated cities to remote communities speak about their Covid-19 preparations, by  Lisa Cox, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 16.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Apr 2020 06.05 EDT\n\n, “It’s a bit strange. I’ve been here 25 years, 10 of them in intensive care. This is like nothing I’ve ever seen before,” Michelle Spence says., “I’ve described it as like preparing for a war. There’s no doubt about it.”, Spence is the nurse unit manager of Royal Melbourne Hospital’s intensive care unit, a 32-bed operation staffed by teams of highly-trained clinicians., Not infrequently, at least 30 of those beds will be occupied by critically ill patients., But right now, there’s a lull. The effect of physical distancing restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus has slowed the flow of patients into the hospital., Fewer people on the streets means fewer road accidents and less of the trauma that is the bread and butter of intensive care and emergency hospital departments., It’s given doctors, nurses, allied health workers and the myriad support workers in Australia’s major hospitals something their colleagues in Italy, the United States and Spain missed out on: time., Time to plan. Time to buy supplies and test equipment. Time to build space and hire and train staff. Hospitals care for critically ill patients every day but not in the numbers or at the scale that has become globally associated with Covid-19., Guardian Australia interviewed health workers around the country, from densely populated cities such as Melbourne, up to remote communities in the Torres Strait, about how they are preparing for a potential influx of patients requiring treatment for the highly contagious disease., The general public and the community can save more lives than intensive care will be able to, The approach hospitals are taking varies based on geography and the volume of resources and clinicians they have to call on. But frontline workers uniformly described the work under way as regimented, repetitive, with “thousands of hours” put in., Most expressed a single fear. That even the best planning will not be enough if individuals do not follow government restrictions related to physical contact., “I think right now, the general public and the community can save more lives than intensive care will be able to,” Chris MacIsaac, the head of Royal Melbourne hospital’s intensive care unit, says., “It’s vital that the curve is flattened so the peak is not as high.”, In the intensive care unit of Royal Melbourne hospital, a major public hospital in the inner suburb of Parkville, doctors and nurses are practising intubation of a coronavirus patient experiencing respiratory failure., The hospital’s ICU has not yet had a Covid-19-positive patient but clinicians are running simulations using a dummy., It’s a complex task, typically performed by one to two critical care doctors and specially-trained nurses who administer medication to stop the patient breathing, insert a tube into the mouth and through the voice box, and initiate artificial breathing using a ventilator., It’s a procedure that comes with a high risk of exposure to the infection, so Royal Melbourne is practising intubating patients using a minimum number of staff, clothed in personal protective equipment (known as PPE), in a negative pressure room., The drills are run daily in intensive care, the emergency department and theatres., MacIsaac says the whole hospital is now running as an emergency operations centre. It’s a framework that exists for major external emergencies, such as a disaster with mass casualties, that demand a large-scale response., “This is a little different because we’ve got such a lead-up time, but the structure of control and command has been in place for weeks,” he says., For hospitals responding to the coronavirus pandemic, the critical element is their ability to care simultaneously for a large influx of seriously ill patients., In the worst-hit countries, hospitals have been overwhelmed and the contagious nature of Covid-19 has led to high rates of infections, as well as deaths, among healthcare workers., Looking after a critically ill patient is more than just connecting them to machines, One of the greatest times of risk of contamination is when staff remove protective equipment, so clinicians are refreshing their knowledge of how to don and doff protective gear safely., ICU patients require sophisticated treatment. Monitoring of heart rates and oxygen levels. Administration of medication and nutrition., Teams are regularly practising how to flip a patient into a prone position, a technique that has been effective for some Covid-19 patients whose oxygen levels fall dangerously low., “Looking after a critically ill patient is more than just connecting them to machines,” MacIsaac says., “A lot of care goes into looking after a critically ill patient and they require highly trained people.”, The hospital currently has 32 staffed beds in its intensive care unit. They’re looking to increase that to 100 by repurposing other parts of the precinct, including the old ICU that closed in 2016, and the recovery room of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Even that might not be enough., MacIsaac says right now they could ventilate 50 patients. The hospital is in negotiations with the Victorian government as to what their allocation from any new supplies will be., But it is his view that “the rate-limiting step” in their capacity to treat people will not be equipment., “What we’re putting a lot of effort into is staffing,” he says., Across the country, state health departments have been seeking expressions of interest from nurses and midwives, medical workers, allied health professionals, paramedics and patient services assistants., Spence, as the nurse unit manager, has carriage of a recruitment drive that will train 100 to 200 additional nurses to work in intensive care., Team members are cold-calling and interviewing potentially suitable candidates but the majority will be nurses who are already working on other wards within the hospital., Typically, they would complete a six-month training course but there is only time for what Spence calls a fast-tracked program in survival skills., “We’re providing that over four days,” she says., As hospitals race to prepare themselves for the pandemic’s peak, three critical resourcing issues repeatedly crop up: access to ventilators, personal protective equipment and beds., Ventilators are used to assist the failing lungs of the most seriously-ill Covid-19 patients., Shortages in places like Italy have caused disaster and pointless loss of life as ICUs struggle to meet extraordinary demand with limited resources., In Australia, estimates of the current level of resourcing suggest there are 2,378 beds across 191 ICUs, each with a ventilator., The government wants to dramatically boost that number., The question is: are there enough ventilators – and the staff needed to operate them – to support such a surge?, Modelling released this week suggests Australia has capacity to surge to an additional 4,261 beds, up by 189%., But there are only an extra 2,361 invasive ventilators to support such a surge., To address a potential shortfall, the federal government has set up a ventilator taskforce, made up of government and industry experts, which is working urgently to bolster stocks., The current strategy is four-fold. First, significantly boost the production of Australia’s only onshore manufacturer of ventilators, a company named Resmed., Second, activate all reserves of ventilators that exist in Australia, including those currently being used in veterinary clinics. Third, purchase more ventilators from overseas suppliers, like Draeger, a German company., And finally, set up arrangements for new domestic manufacturers to utilise existing ventilator designs held by overseas manufacturers, already approved by foreign regulators, to begin producing the machines or parts in Australia., There is confidence from members of the taskforce that this will be enough to meet even the worst-case scenarios., But adequate supply of ventilators is not the only problem. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association’s chief executive, Alison Verhoeven, says the issue will be ensuring the machines are deployed in a way that maximises their coverage of the population., “It will be about having smart plans in place to shift patients out of areas where there might not be ventilators available – and I’m thinking rural and regional areas – to centralised facilities,” Verhoeven told the Guardian., “That’s part of the planning that state health departments have been doing and each of them will have slightly different responses.”, Similarly, access to PPE – masks, gowns, goggles, and gloves – remains a risk to hospital preparedness. Adequate PPE is critical to safely treating Covid-19 patients. Yet many hospitals are already reporting dwindling stocks, particularly in the not-for-profit sector., University of Sydney decision sciences expert, Professor Ben Fahimnia, said he would not be surprised if “hospitals will soon rely on public donations of face masks for health workers”., “Building new production capacity in Australia where we have spent decades economising through offshoring is not easy,” he said. “Even if it is possible to force local production today, it is very unlikely to keep pace with this current pandemic-spurred demand.”, This week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia’s trajectory – that is the rate at which Covid-19 infections are increasing – was showing “promising, encouraging” signs of slowing after the implementation of enforced social distancing measures., “But there are no guarantees,” he said., If we get to three to four weeks down the track and things aren’t mayhem, we’ll be encouraged, Dr Bruce Ashford a head and neck surgeon at Wollongong hospital, on the New South Wales coast thinks it’s too early for optimism. He is coordinating the hospital’s Covid-19 task force, a multidisciplinary team that includes respiratory, emergency and logistical specialists., Ashford describes planning a response to the pandemic as “looking over a cliff into the unknown”., “If we get to three to four weeks down the track and things aren’t mayhem, we’ll be encouraged,” he says., “But I just don’t think there’s enough history to indicate how this is going to go, which is why we have to plan for the worst-case scenario.”, Wollongong hospital is the major referral centre in the Illawarra Shoalhaven local health district, which comprises eight hospitals., It has had what Ashford calls a “disproportionate” number of Covid-19 patients relative to population size. This week the hospital recorded its first death, a 75-year-old man who had been a passenger on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship., Ashford and colleagues have spent countless hours poring over issues such as how patients with Covid-19 will move through the hospital upon their arrival. Core areas – emergency, theatres, intensive care – have been arranged so they are close together, the goal being to minimise contact between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients., The ICU is being separated and expanded to 45 beds for Covid-19 patients and 21 for critically ill non-Covid patients. There’s capacity to increase that by another 10, with 40 to 50 ventilators., Coordinating a response to a 24/7 emergency is complex and several people need to contribute. Doctors and nurses, cleaners, supply and logistics teams, caterers. Strategies have had to be developed to help Covid-19 patients, who can receive no visitors, communicate with their loved ones., Everything before a pandemic seems like an overreaction and everything after seems like an underreaction, At the same time, the day-to-day running of the health service continues and the impact of every decision on other, smaller, hospitals in the region has to be weighed., “The whole effort is based around this idea that everything before a pandemic seems like an overreaction and everything after seems like an underreaction,” Ashford says., He says one advantage in Australia’s favour is that the health system has been able to observe and learn from the experience in other countries. This week, the health minister, Greg Hunt, announced an extra $1.3bn towards integrating the private hospital system into the Covid-19 response., “However, does that mean our efforts are going to be adequate? Probably not,” Ashford says., “I can’t imagine that there’s something so special about Australia that we’re going to be different to the rest of the world., “You look at New York, Milan and Madrid, they are on their last legs. And you think, what would that be like for us?”, A hospital committee including a medical ethicist and senior clinicians is discussing what will be done in the event there are more critically ill patients than resources or ventilators to care for them. There are similar committees, or frameworks, looking at this dilemma in other health districts around the country., Ashford says if it gets to that stage, extremely tough decisions will be inevitable and there will be frank conversations with patients and families about their wishes, as well the constraints on the hospital., Sara Arcioni, a senior registrar in the hospital’s ICU, says frontline workers are used to the emotional load that comes with treating critically ill patients., “It’s just that we may be dealing with many more,” she says., Around the country, plans are being drawn up for how hospitals could increase their capacity beyond their existing facilities., Important regional facilities like Wagga Wagga base hospital have increased ICU capacity and set up procedures to separate the flow of suspected patients, while in Sydney, the Royal Prince Alfred hospital has prepared a dedicated and specially-designed Covid-19 intensive care unit., Major hotels, already being used as quarantine zones for returned travellers, could be converted into wards. In Victoria, the government is developing plans to convert the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition centre into a hospital and morgue., In Canberra this week, the ACT government announced it was working with healthcare company Aspen Medical to rapidly build a temporary emergency department for moderately to severely ill Covid-19 patients., It is also setting up an unregistered workforce made up of volunteers from the community – academics, students and a range of people with health backgrounds – after issuing a callout. Nine hundred people registered., At present, Australia’s capital has emergency departments at two of its hospitals – Canberra hospital in the city’s south and Calvary Public hospital in the city’s north – and has recorded 93 cases of coronavirus, including two deaths this week., Emergency folk are practical folk. I know several of my colleagues, myself included, have made their first will, From Monday, Canberra healthcare workers will start looking more actively for evidence of transmission of the disease in the community by testing a random selection of people who would otherwise not meet the criteria for testing., David Caldicott is an emergency department consultant to Calvary Hospital and a lecturer at the Australian National University Medical School., He said there was anxiety, but not panic, in the emergency community about the potential impact of Covid-19 on frontline workers’ own health., “Emergency folk are practical folk. I know several of my colleagues, myself included, have made their first will,” Caldicott says., He says the biggest concern for health workers was that people who were not in essential roles such as aged care, retail, delivery and cleaning, followed the physical distancing measures., “The frontline is at your front door. It’s entirely up to the public to decide how bad this is going to be,” he says., At Canberra’s hospitals, teams are running drills in full PPE to prepare for how they will manage different types of Covid-19 positive patients, such as a woman in labour, or a deteriorating patient who needs to be transferred to theatre., Working in PPE – mask, goggles, gown and gloves – takes a physical toll. It’s hot and there’s a risk of dehydration. The greatest physical burden is often borne by nurses who have the most direct contact with patients., Bernadette McDonald, the chief executive of Canberra Health Services, said considerable time was being spent on staff welfare and support for workers who might be feeling anxiety., Some major Australian hospitals have been expanding their existing staff support services by bringing in additional psychologists and social workers, and organisations that will supply meals and nutrition for frontline teams., “At this point in time they are the most important people because they’re the people who care for everyone that gets sick,” McDonald says., In Emerald in Queensland’s central highlands a rural fever clinic has been built out of four dongas, each consisting of two rooms, a shower and toilet., Only a week ago, the site was empty space next to the practice run by GP and obstetrician Ewan McPhee, who is also the president of the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine., The clinic – one of 100 GP-led respiratory clinics the federal government is funding as part of its Covid-19 response – has been set up to direct patients with symptoms away from the hospital., Nurses and GPs at the clinic will swab people who meet the criteria for coronavirus testing., Emerald itself has a population of about 15,000 people. There are another 45,000 in the wider district. Emerald hospital has 30 beds and four ventilators., “The worst-case scenario for Emerald in the next three months would be 60 people requiring ventilation and we only have four ventilators,” McPhee says., Federal and state leaders and mayors of councils have pleaded with Australians in recent weeks not to make unnecessary travel into regional and remote communities where the health infrastructure is not set up to cope with a massive surge in patients., Rural Australia already battles with shortages of frontline medical workers. The arrival of Covid-19 and quarantine restrictions has complicated that further in some places with doctors that were on fly-in fly-out arrangements., Emerald has not yet had a patient test positive for Covid-19 but McPhee is concerned the disease will ultimately make its way into the community via southern Queensland. He thinks the testing criteria needs to be expanded so that doctors can test when they suspect a patient has coronavirus and start monitoring community transmission., Separating Covid and non-Covid patients is immediately difficult for rural hospitals in terms of having the physical building space available. McPhee says medical teams in Emerald were having to consider solutions such as managing some hospital patients in their homes., Some very unwell patients would need to be transferred by helicopter or with the Royal Flying Doctor Service to Rockhampton or Brisbane., If the town becomes overrun, they would have to either convert the clinic into a treatment space, or call on the military to establish a field hospital., McPhee said there was enormous pressure on rural health workers who would have “nowhere to hide” in the face of such an emergency and he feels the urgency of the situation has not been fully grasped., “It’s the community that has to make the decision about their future. We can’t fix the problem once it’s in a surge situation,” he said., “That’s what’s going to save Emerald. It’s not going to be a GP-led respiratory clinic. It’s going to be people doing the right thing.”, Further north, Tony Brown is the incident controller for the Covid-19 response for the Torres and Cape hospital and health service., Ordinarily he works as a rural generalist, gynaecologist and obstetrician on Thursday Island but for the duration of the pandemic he will be based in Cairns., The majority of the population in the area covered by the Torres and Cape Health Service is Indigenous. There have been no confirmed Covid-19 cases so far and much of the health strategy is focused on trying to keep the disease out of the community. There is a 14-day quarantine requirement for travellers to the islands., If a doctor or nurse suspects a patient has coronavirus, that person has to isolate themselves at home. Brown says the health service intends to transfer confirmed positive cases to accommodation in Cairns for isolation but “we need to be ready for anything”., “We don’t know what’s coming our way and how many people are going to be affected,” Brown says., Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are among the Australians most at risk of becoming severely ill due to Covid-19., Last week frontline doctors said they were preparing for “death and suffering” in these communities because of a lack of resources and many have gone into lockdown., The Torres and Cape hospital and health service has four hospitals – Thursday Island, Bamaga, Cooktown and Weipa – the largest of which has 26 beds and the smallest about six. There are 31 primary healthcare clinics run by nurses. Three new ventilators are on order but the plan is for any patient requiring ventilation to be flown to Cairns., If demand on the small health teams becomes too great, they would need to ask for assistance, including from the army., “We’ve got the capacity to deal with only a certain number of people in our hospitals because we only have so many resources to manage them,” Brown said., “So we have a tipping point where we turn to the state and say ‘we’re not coping’.”, With Christopher Knauslike preparing for war australias hospitals brace for coronavirus peak", "label": 0}, "train-280": {"text": "\nBondi Beach: how the Australian icon became a coronavirus hotspot\n, \nBondi Beach: how the Australian icon became a coronavirus hotspot\n, Bondi is one of NSW’s most famous destinations, drawing 2.6 million visitors a year. Has its popularity made it vulnerable to Covid-19?, Daisy Dumas, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 16.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Apr 2020 20.37 EDT\n\n, A block from Bondi Beach six female travellers, all aged between 22 and 31, share a two-bedroom flat, each paying $200 a week in rent., They came to Australia, and settled in Bondi, for the work opportunities, the sun and the freedom., Last week, two of the women tested positive for Covid-19., The Sydney beach suburb draws 2.6 million visitors each year, according to Destination New South Wales. It’s a place of contrasts. Sparkling natural bounty and dense urban living. Billionaires and backpackers. Instagrammed bodies and old-timers’ swimming clubs. A place obsessed with health and beauty but now, one of Australia’s Covid-19 hotspots., Bondi, part of Waverley council area, has taken a heavy hit from the coronavirus, the local council’s 159 cases as of Friday (101 of them in Bondi alone) knocking the sunshine out of the surfside playground., This week, in response to Waverley’s newfound status as home to both the highest number of Covid-19 cases and the highest number of locally transmitted cases in the state, the government opened a local pop-up testing clinic. , While the advice during the global coronavirus pandemic is to stay home, the reality for some, especially in a place like Bondi, is that crowded living conditions make physical distancing difficult, even for the most prudent., “I couldn’t believe I was negative, I slept in the same room as two positive girls,” says one of the Argentinian housemates who was given the all-clear, who did not want to be named. “I was staying home, worrying about the virus outside, but it was in my own place.”, Unsure where to turn, she appealed to the authorities for help and her infected housemates – one of whom is suspected to have caught the virus in the house – were moved into quarantine in hotels, paid for by the government., For the others, a sense of gratitude has settled on the flat: they and their sick housemates are safe and isolated, friends are helping with food deliveries and a neighbour has lent them exercise equipment. She has heard of worse, including newly jobless, homeless travellers who cannot get to their home countries, and infected members of shared houses who have stayed put., They’re like many temporary working visa holders who continue to share cramped homes, some of 12 to 15 people, across the suburb. Since 20 March, hostels, meanwhile, have had to comply with new distancing rules of one person every 4 sq metres. At Noah’s Backpackers, just along from James Packer’s erstwhile beach house, every room, including six-bed dormitories, were made single occupancy., People see you walk out of the hostel and they shout at you and say Bondi's an epicentre of disease., The landmark building has a view down on to the Bondi Beach that is usually alive with crowded surf and its famous lifeguards. On 21 March, the beach was closed, its entrances hastily fenced off. With no surfers and sunbathers, Bondi Beach has never looked so bare. Now in the spotlight as the centre of Australia’s coronavirus outbreak, the suburb has never felt quite so exposed., The scene is a far cry from images just over two weeks ago, when crowds from well beyond Sydney’s east took to the sand on a 36C day, flouting social distancing rules and the new 500-person limit on outdoor gatherings. A hot Friday with family-friendly surf is what Bondi does best – but by the next afternoon and in the glare of global media, police were sweeping the beach of sunbathers, forbidding even surfers to enter the water. For the first time, the beach known around the world as an icon of Australia’s natural beauty and symbol of our love of the sea and sun is now associated with something far less glamorous. , When New South Wales chief health Officer Dr Kerry Chant singled out backpackers and their potential to infect the community when outlining the response, she directed public focus towards Bondi’s reputation as a destination for travellers, already in the headlines because of a coronavirus cluster traced to a tropical-themed party at a popular Bondi beachfront bar., From Noah’s Backpackers, the view is bleak. A few weeks ago, the hostel was bustling with 266 guests. Now, it’s desolate, with manager Dylan Tenbrink closing its doors last Wednesday, saying it was “impossible” to stay open under the new regulations around social distancing as well as media scrutiny. Unfounded rumours of a positive case of the virus in the hostel were unfairly targeting backpackers and the result was fear among both visitors and the community, he says., “Bondi’s one of the greatest suburbs in the entire world. There’s opportunity, it’s safe, there’s freedom for everybody,” Tenbrink told Guardian Australia in the days before the hostel shut. “Now, people see you walk out of the hostel and they shout at you and say it’s an epicentre of disease.”, With a young, international demographic and thousands of daily visitors, Bondi’s infection rate comes as little surprise to local photographer and Aquabumps gallery owner, Eugene Tan. He has photographed Bondi Beach at daybreak for the last 21 years, and the daily surf photos are known worldwide., “Bondi’s a brand, everybody knows it. You come to Sydney, you come to Bondi. It’s a welcoming place,” he says. It’s that spirit that might have landed Bondi in the situation it’s in today., “The police cleared the beach on Saturday and then all the bars filled up. It’s a melting pot, which I love, but Bondi gets out of hand easily – we have a lot of travellers and they have a carefree attitude.”, But to point to the backpacker community alone as responsible for local infection rates is to miss the reality of Bondi’s broader community., The suburb has long been home to professionals and young families from all over the world and less than half of its population is born in Australia, with many residents from Europe, South Africa, America and Brazil. At a local childcare centre where a parent tested positive for the virus, children speak Italian, French, German, Swedish, Hungarian, Russian, Chinese, Spanish and Italian. Long-haul travel, responsible for bringing the vast majority of Covid-19 infections into Australia but also for connecting expats with their families, is as much a way of life as the beach., The Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, says it is the kindness of the community and its adaptability that stands it in good stead for the future. “We are all in this together.” , Brand Bondi, after all, reaches well beyond its bay and, to Tan, its pull is stronger than ever. He has been receiving messages from people all over the world telling him how images of Bondi are keeping them sane during lockdown., “Without the beach,” he says, “you feel a bit lost.”bondi beach how the australian icon became a coronavirus hotspot", "label": 0}, "train-281": {"text": "\nAustralian children remain trapped in al-Hawl camp as region braces for coronavirus\n, Calls for countries around the world to repatriate citizens amid fears the camp is vulnerable to a Covid-19 outbreak, \nBen Doherty, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 16.00 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Apr 2020 01.56 EDT\n\n, Forty-seven Australian children remain trapped in the abject al-Hawl camp in north-east Syria, as the region braces for a potential Covid-19 outbreak., Syria has reported only a handful of cases, and there are none confirmed in the camp housing 68,000 women and children, most of them family of Islamic State fighters, but there has been little Covid-19 testing across the war-torn country., In neighbouring Turkey, more than 18,000 cases have been confirmed, and the rate of infection is on the steepest upward curve of any country in the world., Fabrizio Carboni, the regional director for the Near and Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross, tells the Guardian al-Hawl is “hell … this place really is hell”, and acutely vulnerable to a Covid-19 outbreak., “The challenge for us is prevention, to avoid the virus getting into the camp, and to isolate any cases at all costs to stop the spread in the camp. But really, if this epidemic gets into the camp, forget about having medical supplies, it will be impossible to control.”, Kamalle Dabboussy, whose daughter and three grandchildren have been held in the camp for more than a year, says while there are no confirmed cases in north-east Syria “we are hearing reports of some women presenting with pneumonia-like symptoms”., “However, we note there are no testing kits, so we just don’t know what that means., “As family members, we are very scared… if Covid-19 hits al-Hawl camp it will be a catastrophe.”, In al-Hawl camp, on a barren and windswept plain in Syria’s north-east, 68,000 women and children – most are children – live crammed into just 1.8sq km, in squalid and crowded conditions, in tents which flood regularly and are exposed to high winds. The past winter brought snow and waves of illness, including frostbite, diarrhoea, rickets and asthma., Syria is ill-prepared for an outbreak: weak state structures, an internally displaced population of seven million, and large parts of the country falling outside central government control make controlling the spread of the virus almost impossible., Al-Hawl camp is one of the most vulnerable places on earth to a Covid-19 outbreak, analysis from the International Rescue Committee shows., Social distancing is impossible in the camp, with large family groups, even multiple families, living in single tents. People need to queue for food, water and medical care., “This is also a weakened population,” Carboni said. “They have limited access to healthcare and psychologically they don’t know what will happen to them, they live in a permanent state of limbo.”, Children are suffering acutely inside the confines of al-Hawl., “These are children who are highly traumatised, they have experienced war, almost all of them have seen family members killed,” Carboni said., “And they have nothing, they are on their own, these kids are held in a space with nothing, no school, no books, no playground, no toys.”, Currently, there are 19 Australian women and 47 Australian children held in the camp. The Australian government is aware of their identities and the bona fides of their Australian citizenship or right to claim that citizenship., They are family members of former foreign fighters who have been captured or killed. None of the Australian women in the camp have been charged as being combatants, and many were coerced, forced or tricked into travelling to Syria., The youngest child in the Australian group is four months old, born on 30 November last year. Winter has been brutal on the Australian group, who live in close proximity to each other., One three-year-old Australian girl held in the camp contracted severe frostbite on her left hand. Unable to access treatment, she is likely to lose her fingers., The families held in the camp have consistently pleaded with Australia to assist with their repatriation: the women in the camp have said they would submit to monitoring, such as control orders, if they were returned., Were the children and their mothers able to get to an Australian embassy or consulate, the Australian government would be legally obliged to provide them travel documents to return home., But the Australian government has consistently refused to repatriate its citizens, despite the urgings of the Kurdish forces running the camp, its ally America, and other countries such as the UK, Germany, Denmark and France repatriating their citizens., A small group of Australian orphans has been repatriated to Australia, but no family members with adults have been brought back since the Australians were taken to the camp a year ago., The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has said the government is not prepared to risk other Australian lives in any repatriation effort. He said some of the Australians in the camp were “hardcore” and “have the potential and capacity to come back here and cause a mass casualty event”., “So I don’t think it should come as a surprise when we say we’re not going to send our soldiers to rescue people of this nature.”, Sources in the camp say repatriating foreign nationals remains relatively straightforward. Kurdish forces have been taking foreign citizens to and across the nearby Iraqi border, without the involvement of third country troops or diplomatic staff., Carboni urged nations around the world to repatriate their citizens from al-Hawl camp., “You can’t keep people indefinitely in a quasi-detention regime. If they’ve done something wrong, prosecute them, sentence them, and for the ones who are not charged with crimes, just bring them home., “The international community has a collective responsibility to these women and children.

These are the main stories on Saturday 4 April., The number of cases in Australia reached 5,544 on Saturday and the death toll rose to 30. A woman in her 70s died in hospital in Victoria on Friday night and a man in his 80s died at the Canberra Hospital in the ACT on Saturday. NSW recorded an additional 104 cases, Victoria recorded 30 new cases and Western Australia 14, nine of which are Western Australian and five linked to the Artania cruise ship. NSW Health said on Saturday that 110 people in quarantine in Sydney hotels had been tested for coronavirus after showing symptoms. They were expected to receive their results on Saturday., The deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, advised the wider public against wearing face masks, in part due to supply constraints, and also because “incorrect use can actually make it more dangerous”. He said that authorities were continuing to look at mask use and advice may change in the future., New South Wales police conducted the largest maritime operation in Sydney Harbour outside of wartime to move crew and supplies between a series of stranded cruise ships before they depart Australian waters.

International students working in aged care, as nurses and in supermarkets have had the amount of hours they can work extended to support critical sectors. New Zealanders who are on 444 visas and arrived before 26 February 2001 will have access to welfare payments and the jobkeeper payment. Temporary skilled visa holders who have been stood down, but not laid off, will maintain their visa validity and businesses will have the opportunity to extend their visa as per normal arrangements. They will also be able to access up to $10,000 superannuation this financial year., In other changes, working holiday makers who work in agriculture or food processing will be exempt from the six-month work limitation with the one employer and eligible for a further visa to keep working in these critical sectors and Seasonal Worker Programme and Pacific Labour Scheme workers can extend their stay for up to 12 months to work for approved employers., Australia’s national science agency CSIRO says zoonotic diseases – diseases which pass from animals to humans such as Covid-19 and Sars – now account for almost 75% of human infectious diseases.

Leaked emails show the ship’s doctor told authorities on 18 March that people who had presented at the onboard medical clinic with flu-like symptoms had tested negative for influenza., Yet on 19 March about 2,700 passengers were allowed to depart the ship at Sydney’s Circular Quay and travel onward, before test swabs had been analysed by state health authorities, who had considered the ship a “low risk” of carrying coronavirus., A total of 662 people linked to the cruise ship have been infected with Covid-19 and seven passengers have died., The NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, has described the incident as one of the most significant health failures in the state’s history and called on Hazzard to stand down., During a heated press conference appearance on Saturday, the health minister faced aggressive questioning about the government’s handling of the Ruby Princess., “Can I just say that the experts who made the decision were the best in the world,” Hazzard said., “Each of the staff of the chief health officer who made the decision made it to the best of their ability. And those people are experts in their field.”, The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said those who had died had all contracted the virus on board, and that authorities believed it might have spread through the ship from infected crew members preparing food. Sources familiar with ship said crew rarely disembarked and that the infection would have likely been brought on board by a passenger., Chant said that if NSW Health had known that coronavirus was on board the ship, they would have disembarked the passengers differently and moved them directly to self-isolation., But she said that would have only prevented 11 known cases of the virus that were subsequently spread within the community., “Cases that we could have averted by decanting people in a more ordered way with face masks and taking them directly to their homes, would have been in the order of 11,” Chant said., “The people that have acquired their infection on the cruise ship could not have been avoided and every period of time that people were on that cruise ship, there were actually at risk of more transmission on the cruise ship in a very, vulnerable age group.”, NSW Health has said the rapid influenza tests conducted onboard the Ruby Princess often return false negative results and that it believed “the illness and test results identified on board was consistent with influenza”., Guardian Australia understands crew members on four Royal Caribbean ships – Celebrity Solstice, Ovation of the Seas, Voyager of the Seas and Spectrum of the Seas – are being sorted into groups according to their country of origin before the ships depart Australian waters., NSW police said these ships would return to their home ports, though maritime sources say that is unlikely as most are “flag of convenience” vessels registered in the Bahamas. Crew members who remain onboard are mostly Indonesian, Indian, Sri Lankan and Filipino., At least two of those ships – Voyager of the Seas and Celebrity Solstice – have been linked to fatal Covid-19 cases., Documents seen by Guardian Australia show almost 800 crew members from Celebrity Solstice were transferred to two separate ships, the Ovation of the Seas and Voyager of the Seas, under police escort., More than 600 crew members were transferred from the Ovation of the Seas to Spectrum of the Seas., Maritime sector sources told Guardian Australia many crew members stuck aboard those ships were “frightened” and believed they were being separated in order to be returned to their countries of origin., I watched on today as #CruiseShips crew were transferred between ships and sent off our coast.

A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.” Johnson on 27 March became the first leader of a major power to announce that he had tested positive. He has been isolating in his Downing Street flat since., NSW police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship coronavirus disaster. The ship has been the focus of intense criticism since its 2,700 passengers were allowed to freely disembark in Sydney on 19 March. At least 11 passengers from ship have now died, more than 30% of Australia’s total Covid-19 deaths. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller said on Sunday the investigation will look at the actions of every agency involved as well as the cruise ship operator. “There’s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from Covid-19,” Fuller said. “The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.”, The US surgeon general has told the country to expect a “Pearl Harbour” moment in the next week, as Covid-19 deaths reach unprecedented levels. “It’s going to be the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives, and we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side, everyone needs to do their part,” Jerome Adams told NBC News’ Meet the Press. Trump has already said he won’t wear a mask, but Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden said on Sunday that he would. , Italy has registered its lowest number of daily deaths from coronavirus in two weeks as the number of people in hospital with the disease decreased for the first time. Italy’s civil protection authority said on Sunday that 21,815 people had so far recovered from the virus, 819 more than on Saturday. There was also some cause for optimism in Spain, where daily Covid-19 deaths declined to 674, the lowest figure since March 26. Meanwhile in the UK, the total number of deaths approached 5,000, amid signs of strain on the country’s National Health Service. A hospital on the outskirts of London is one of the first to say a shortage of oxygen prompted them to consider prioritising which patients would need it most. , Health officials say the coronavirus curve may be flattening, but warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early. “We are hopeful that we are starting to flatten the curve. But there is more work to be done and it is important that we all heed those messages,” said Dr Jeremy McAnulty, NSW Health’s director of health protection., Australia’s private health insurance funds could reap between $3.5bn and $5.5bn due to falls in elective surgery during the coronavirus crisis.

Christian Porter, the attorney general, opened the door to allowing more of the casual workforce to access the wage subsidies – an issue that has been raised by unions, business groups and various MPs., The Queensland government has been accused of endangering children’s lives after it announced a new “hard line on youth crime” approach that aimed to place more children in detention. The policy means Queensland’s youth detention centres are almost full, and children may have to be “warehoused” in adult watch-houses during the pandemic., Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand’s lockdown has prevented thousands of extra cases, but called for even better compliance.

The search began on Thursday afternoon after a report of a canoe in the bay that did not return to shore and appeared to be overtaken by strong winds., There is no evidence to support the over-the-top laws put in place in NSW and Victoria in response to the coronavirus, infectious diseases physician and microbiologist Peter Collignon argues. “We need everyone to continue to comply with the rules we put in place mid-March and will likely need to do so until at least September. Some states have now put in overzealous rules and ones that give very mixed messages or have little biological plausibility. Not only will this cause unwarranted and increased social, mental and economic harm, we run the bigger risk that a substantial part of our society in a few months’ time might increasingly rebel against many restrictions.”, One of the biggest puzzles of the Covid-19 pandemic is that it routinely hits the oldest hardest, but occasionally it strikes down young, apparently fit individuals, including medical staff exposed to patients with the virus.

pass on to customers their fall in costs as elective surgery is cut, \nBen Butler, \n\nSun 5 Apr 2020 13.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Apr 2020 18.00 EDT\n\n, Private health insurance funds stand to reap a windfall of between $3.5bn and $5.5bn due to a dramatic fall in elective surgery and other medical procedures during the coronavirus crisis, according to new research from the Australia Institute thinktank., Health expert Roy Harvey said if the funds failed to pass on the dramatic fall in costs to customers, more people will flee a private health insurance system that is already in a death spiral., Harvey, who worked with Australia Institute research director Rod Campbell on the report, said that if premiums were cut in line with services the federal government would also save $1bn to $1.5bn a year in subsidies., The Australia Institute paper, “Private eyes ..., hips, etc”, models the effect on the funds if benefits paid to members drop by between 30% and 50% during a six-month period., Factors taken into account include health minister Greg Hunt’s decision last week to pay at least $1.3bn to private hospitals to take over beds potentially needed to accommodate Covid-19 victims, and sweeping bans on dental services introduced by dentists., Harvey said that many funds have abandoned premium hikes that were planned for this month, but this was not enough., “They’ve been saying we won’t put through the 4% increase that they’re allowed to do in April, but if they say, ‘Oh, we’ll give you a 40% discount’, people might stay., “If they keep their rates unchanged, people will leave in droves.”, The coronavirus pandemic has hit a private health industry that experts say was already in a “death spiral” because young people, who get relatively little from the product, have quit paying premiums., This has left the funds with a membership increasingly weighted towards older people, who typically require more expensive medical procedures., The escalating financial instability of the industry led the regulator to warn in February that only three will be viable in two years unless urgent action is taken., “It sounds as if you’re not talking about a viable system or a product people want to buy,” Harvey said., “The thing is unsustainable, it’s undermining the public hospital principle of equity and allowing doctors to charge fees that take people out of the public hospitals.”, He said it was hard to estimate the impact of the pandemic on private health using publicly available figures, but the $3.5bn to $5.5bn range was a good starting point., “I think any detailed study would come up with figures that are in the range,” he said., “Other people can say, ‘Oh, I think it’s this or that’, but it’s really to get a discussion started., “The Productivity Commission could sort this out in less than a week in terms of getting good estimates.”, He said the funds should be held accountable for their windfall and money saved by the government could be used to fund other things, such as domestic violence services, that are needed during the pandemic., “The savings to the commonwealth alone could be one to one and a half billion dollars – one and a half billion used to be a lot of money once,” he said., Campbell said the insurers looked set to trouser their windfall billions., “Insurers claim to be supporting their members through the crisis by delaying premium increases, but they should be passing on these significant savings to households,” he said., “If the commonwealth does not ensure savings are passed on to customers, it will be one of the most egregious subsidies ever given to an industry already infamous for receiving handouts.”australias private health funds could reap windfall from coronavirus

implemented after outcry at unfair treatment wound back as centres near capacity , \nBen Smee, \n\nSun 5 Apr 2020 13.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Apr 2020 14.03 EDT\n\n, The population of Queensland’s youth detention centres has ballooned to near capacity amid a government-sponsored crime crackdown, prompting concern from human rights activists that vulnerable children are being placed at risk during the coronavirus outbreak., The state’s human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, said without urgent attention, he thought it “inevitable” that children would again be “warehoused for prolonged periods” in police watch houses – a situation that provoked outcry about their treatment and prompted reforms of the youth justice system., “Last year we saw children held in adult watch houses in some cases for weeks on end,” McDougall told Guardian Australia., “On the present trajectory we are rapidly approaching the same situation and the Covid-19 pandemic brings another layer of complexity to this crisis.”, In 2018, Guardian Australia reported concerns about children being held in watch houses for extended periods due to overcrowded detention centres., The ABC’s Four Corners program last year revealed that children as young as 10 had been housed in police custody alongside maximum security offenders., The program prompted significant reform by the Queensland government and its approach was praised by human rights groups. It established a separate department for youth justice and announced initiatives to keep children out of detention and watch houses., Last month the government made an about-face policy pivot: it announced a new “hard line on youth crime” approach that aimed to place more children in detention. This was partly a response to vocal campaigning by local media in Townsville, where Labor seats are considered vulnerable at this year’s state election., In its announcement, the government said it would take “tougher action on bail” including seeking to keep more children on remand, and a “police blitz on bail” to appeal court decisions., “These are changes our MPs in Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and the Gold Coast have advocated and the government has acted,” the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said., This week, there are 223 children in youth detention centres; significantly up from late last year, when the initial youth justice reforms were starting to take effect., There are 258 youth detention beds in Queensland, but it is unclear whether these are all available, as ongoing expansion works at the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre had temporarily reduced its capacity, and these works are ongoing., Human rights advocates with knowledge of Queensland’s youth detention system say the “safe” capacity of these centres is below the total bed numbers, as crowded facilities limit the ability of authorities to separate detainees of different ages and risk profiles., Crowding is often also considered a contributing factor to incidents in youth detention centres. On 18 March, a disturbance occurred at the Townsville centre that involved three boys climbing on to the roof., McDougall said the overwhelming majority of children in youth detention were from Aboriginal families, and many were accused of offences while living in unstable residential care arrangements., “The situation calls for intensive resources to be made available to Aboriginal controlled organisations to assist the safe return of children to Aboriginal families and kinship carers. Aboriginal voices need to be heard in the process of finding creative solutions to this pressing crisis.”, Concerns about “hard line” policies disproportionately affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and broad powers given to police to enforce public health regulations., Amnesty International Indigenous rights campaigner Lidia Thorpe said detention often took children out of safe environments with family., “Locking them up is putting them at more risk, given we’ve seen already this virus has got into prisons. Because of the overcrowding it puts kids or anyone at more risk of getting the virus., “The safest place for these kids is at home.”, Thorpe was critical of the government’s youth crime shift, which she said fed into a narrative that promotes racist attitudes towards Aboriginal people., “I think we have to keep in mind the Queensland election is coming up and unfortunately when we do have progressive governments in power, it becomes a race to the bottom on law and order. We’ve seen this around the country where we’ve had Labor governments in power., “It’s wrong to suggest that when we see a child misbehaving that the best thing for that is to lock them up and isolate them. If this was happening to non-Aboriginal kids we would see an outrage in this nation, but because it’s happening to Aboriginal people it’s like it’s expected.”, The office of the state minister for child safety, youth and women, Di Farmer, said in March there were an average of seven young people a day held in police watch houses – down from 34 in March 2019 – and that the vast majority of those were waiting for a court hearing or processing., “The average number of days spent in a Queensland police watch house since January 2020 was two days, which reflects the significant transport arrangements required for transfer from remote and regional communities,” a spokesman for the minister said., “The government is investing $177m in new youth detention centres beds, which includes the expansion of Brisbane Youth Detention centre with 16 new beds due to come online in May, and construction of a new 32-bed youth detention centre at Wacol., “This investment means state-wide capacity will increase from 258 beds to 306 beds by the end of this year.”policy backflip in lead up to queensland election puts youth in detention centres at risk of coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-290": {"text": "\nMan shot dead by police in Brisbane after allegedly setting himself alight\n, The 43 year-old man was shot dead in Sunnybank Hills on Monday night, Australian Associated Press, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 18.04 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Apr 2020 18.17 EDT\n\n, Police have shot a man dead after he allegedly set himself on fire and ran towards officers in Brisbane’s south., Emergency services were called to Sunnybank Hills about 9pm on Monday following reports a man was pouring fuel over himself and a house, with police alleging he then set himself alight and approached officers at 10pm., An officer shot the 43 year-old man and police extinguished the flames and rendered first aid but he died a short time later., The Ethical Standards Command will investigate the incident on behalf of the coroner., • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;bSuicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636.man shot dead by police in brisbane after allegedly setting himself alight", "label": 0}, "train-291": {"text": "\nHealth workers 'going to Bunnings' to source personal protective equipment, doctor tells Q+A\n, Stephen Parnis told ABC program colleagues are worried about the provision of critical PPE during the Covid-19 pandemic • Follow the latest coronavirus developments in Australia live • Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email • Download the free Guardian app to get the most important news notifications, \nMichael McGowan, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 17.55 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 19.00 EDT\n\n, Senior health workers have resorted to shopping at Bunnings to source personal protective equipment because of shortages during the Covid-19 crisis, an emergency doctor has said., Stephen Parnis, a Victorian emergency doctor and former vice president of the Australian Medical Association, told the ABC’s Q+A program on Monday night that health workers were “very worried” about supplies of protective equipment., “I spoke to a number of colleagues around the country before coming on to the program and I have to say we’re all very worried about the provision of personal protective equipment,” Parnis said., “I’ve seen department directors going to Bunnings and seen people look and hope they might have contacts overseas. And it’s probably the number one concern for health workers around the country at the moment., Guardian Australia has previously reported fears of shortages of PPE in the health system as the number of cases of Covid-19 rises across Australia. Rural Aboriginal medical services in particular face a “catastrophic” shortage., Monday’s Q+A, dedicated to the experiences of frontline healthcare workers, revealed significant concern among doctors about the shortage., Vyom Sharma, a general practitioner from Victoria, said his practice was down to about 10 surgical masks and suggested the federal government should have done more to source supplies sooner., “We’re trying to save them for when we really need them,” he said., “And the concern is it’s actually affecting the nature of care we can provide. We are transitioning to telehealth at the moment, offering face-to-face consultations when required. But they have to be reduced in a way that’s commensurate to the supply we have available., “It’s correct what Steven Parnis said, we’re very worried about the lack of personal protective equipment and it’s been affecting the care we’ve been offering patients throughout. When the criteria for Covid-19 had been changing gradually through February and March, a huge percentage of my population were overseas students and travellers and tourists., “And you’re rationing masks even then. And there are people coughing and sneezing one day who come from South Korea or Italy and a few day later the criteria changes and it says these people are high risk and you wonder ‘should I have used a mask on them and I would have if I had enough’.”, Lucy Morgan, a respiratory physician from Sydney’s Nepean hospital, said she was “reassured” by work done to supply public hospitals with PPE as the number of Covid-19 cases began to quickly escalate in March. But, she said, healthcare workers in other areas including GPs and specialists in private practice could find it harder to source equipment., “Their access to protective gear is a little bit less secure. I think they have, they haven’t got the same bargaining power or purchasing power that hospitals or health departments have. And I think that’s another challenge for us,” she said., Also on Monday, shadow minister for health Chris Bowen criticised the Ruby Princess fiasco after the death of a 12th former passenger of the cruise ship., “There has to be a full explanation to the Australian people about how Border Force let that happen. It is just unacceptable.”, Liberal MP Katie Allen said she was pleased that New South Wales police commissioner Mick Fuller had launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess case “so that we can get to the bottom of actually what happened”., A former medical researcher, Allen said the government had been increasing hospital capacity in preparation for more cases of the virus., “As a government, we’re being very careful about looking at ventilator capacity and we’re also bringing more nurses online because those intensive care beds need 24-hour care and we do need more nurses,” she said., “We are bringing more people into the workforce to make sure we’re ready for a possibility that may actually not actually eventuate but we need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.”, health workers going to bunnings to source personal protective equipment doctor tells qa", "label": 0}, "train-292": {"text": "Morning mail: Johnson in ICU, inside New York's crisis, finding light in the dark, \nMorning mail: Johnson in ICU, inside New York's crisis, finding light in the dark\n, Tuesday: UK prime minister moved to intensive care as condition worsens.

Follow the latest developments live., A Guardian Essential poll released this morning shows Scott Morrison’s approval has been boosted by his management of the Covid-19 response. With the government deploying interventionist measures that would usually be the antithesis of the Liberals’ political approach, it seems that Morrison has also picked up the support of Labor and Green voters. But as Essential executive director Peter Lewis writes, Morrison may have “changed tack against his tribal instincts”, and political support in a crisis is ephemeral., Coronavirus testing in some Aboriginal communities in Victoria  has had to stop because of a lack of personal protective equipment. Some clinics have just two weeks of PPE left with no immediate prospect of re-supply, creating a situation they described as “catastrophic”. The deputy chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly has warned that some of the people in intensive care units across Australia are in their 30s with no underlying health issues. “This is not just an old person’s disease,” he said. Meanwhile, Prof Mikhail Prokopenko, a pandemic modelling expert, says Australian cases could drop to zero by July – but only if the country can record 90% compliance with social distancing rules. Australia’s death toll is now 41. , There was good news in Italy, as the country recorded its lowest daily rise in infections – 1,941 – the lowest day-to-day rise registered since 30 March. For the third day in a row, there was a decrease in the number of intensive care beds in use. Falling numbers in Europe may offer some hope to the US, which is about to enter the “peak of a terrible pandemic”. With the country’s death toll now over 10,000, New York governor Andrew Cuomo warned that his state may also be reaching an apex. “If we are plateauing, we are plateauing at a very high level. Staying at this level is problematic,” he said.

But what happens after coronavirus?\n, The prime minister will rightly gain plaudits for managing Australia’s response but support in a time of national crisis is ephemeral, Contact author, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 13.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 02.10 EDT\n\n, After jettisoning key policies, embracing economic stimulus and taking a more decisive position on lockdowns and wages, the prime minister has enjoyed a resounding surge in personal support., This turnaround echoes that of George Costanza, Jerry Seinfeld’s hapless sidekick, who hit a winning streak after committing to do the exact opposite of his every natural instinct., So too Scott Morrison: the states forced him to be more decisive on lockdowns, especially schools, while unions and businesses prevailed on him to reverse his earlier opposition to wage subsidy. This followed his new conversion to Keynesian economics, most recently injecting billions into free childcare, a notion ridiculed by his team as communism before the last election., Full credit to Morrison and his government for changing tack and bringing more stakeholders to the decision-making table, but again this is something that would chafe with the PM’s natural, more tribal instincts., The “big tent” leadership approach is that which the Rudd government brought to the GFC and Bill Shorten would have been expected to adopt if he had been successful at last year’s election when he ran on a “team” ticket. In contrast, Morrison’s shtick was one man and a baseball cap., But these are unprecedented times, and as this week’s Essential Report shows, the public is ready to embrace someone who approaches leadership as a team game., Like Costanza, the PM changed up from a position of relative weakness. The first weeks of the crisis had not been strong for the PM – the rating of 39% approval reflected the mixed messages, especially the Trumpian “I’m going to the footy” with a reluctance to step up distancing measures., Thirty-nine per cent Morrison needed to play the team game. The question will be whether 59% Morrison recognises this cooperation is the foundation of his new authority or whether he reverts to typical Costanza-like behaviour., The increase in approval for government comes in a week where the public appeared to (finally) twig to the reality of the crisis, with fewer people seeing the response as an underreaction. , Through the crisis the trends of trust in both government and media continue to rise, while the personal financial concerns have abated somewhat since the announcement of the jobkeeper allowance., For opposition leader Anthony Albanese, this is a difficult period for different reasons. Having been left out of the national cabinet, Albanese is forced to lead from the sidelines., This is reflected in the relatively flat response to the opposition leader’s performance. No drop-off with the increased satisfaction in the PM, but no statistical relevant increase in his standing either., There are important roles for the opposition in the here and now, scrutinising government decisions without being seen to block; Labor’s role, for example, in the wage subsidy turnaround should not be underestimated., But the political contest will be reloaded during the economic reconstruction. That’s where we will learn whether the responses to a crisis of working together to co-create solutions can prevail., What will be the rules governing any “snap back”? How will the rights of workers and citizens be reinstituted after the crisis? As Greg Jericho argued over the weekend, talk of socialism is overblown, the government’s response still runs the risk of preserving interests of businesses over the interests of workers, and when “hibernation” ends there will be genuine contests over which will carry., Will the tax system, for instance, continue to skew in favour of those with existing capital? Will the government persevere with its plans for a regressive flat tax? Who will bear the costs of bringing the budget back into balance?Will a party that has never believed in government have the wherewithal to think through ideas like joint equity and mutual ownership, or will they just revert to type and find the only solution in a corporate framework?, How will the government support new and newly relevant industries, as the reality of a globally constrained world demands new local capabilities and supply chains?, These broader questions, rather than the management of the crisis, will frame the choices voters make in 2022, a date that right now feels an eternity away., The challenge in opposition right now is to think through and start the process of defining those choices., Morrison will rightly gain plaudits for managing Australia’s response, providing he continues to temper his natural instincts to go one out and divide. But even Winston Churchill could not translate that leadership into re-election after the second world war ended., George H Bush made it to 89% after the first Gulf war, only to lose the presidency to Bill Clinton two years later. Even his son hit mid-80s after 9/11., The reality for both leaders is that support in a time of national crisis is ephemeral, politics unites for a time but there will be time for a renewed contest in the months to come., • Peter Lewis will be discussing this week’s report with Katharine Murphy at 1pm on Tuesday 7 April at Australia at Home’s Political Geekfest.morrison has changed tack against his tribal instincts but what happens after coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-294": {"text": "\nLack of PPE forces Aboriginal health groups to stop testing for coronavirus\n, Shortages creating ‘catastrophic’ situation among vulnerable Indigenous groups with some services on brink of closing doors, \nChristopher Knaus and \nLorena Allam, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 13.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Apr 2020 14.09 EDT\n\n, A number of Aboriginal health groups in Victoria have been forced to cease Covid-19 testing and consider shutting their doors due to a lack of personal protective equipment., The Guardian revealed last week that Aboriginal medical services in New South Wales, particularly in regional areas, were struggling to access the PPE needed to safely treat and test for the virus., Some clinics had just two weeks of PPE left with no immediate prospect of re-supply, creating a situation they described as “catastrophic”., The Guardian understands the NSW government has now written to the commonwealth asking for the urgent release of supplies to the state’s Aboriginal medical services and for direct access to the government’s national medical stockpile., The problem, though, is not confined to NSW., In Victoria, Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations have warned they are facing “critical” PPE shortages, which have forced some into the difficult position of stopping Covid-19 testing until new stock is provided., A number of Aboriginal health groups are making their own PPE to get by, according to the the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation Inc (VACCHO), the peak body for Indigenous health and wellbeing in the state., Others have considered closing entirely because they cannot source enough equipment., VACCHO chair Karen Heap said the centre she runs in Ballarat – the Ballarat &amp; District Aboriginal Co-Operative – had run out of PPE and been forced to close temporarily last week., The centre was conducting Covid-19 testing for Indigenous Australians and has since re-opened. But Heap says it only has one to two weeks of PPE left., “We’ve struggled for quite a while,” Heap told the Guardian. “We’ve run out. We found a few gowns that we could use, but we haven’t got a good supply at all.”, “We know we’re not the only ones asking for PPE, it’s across the nation. But we’re trying to provide a service to the Aboriginal community across Victoria and we’d like to be able to help with testing., “It just makes it easier for our community to come to our health services to get tested … they know us.”, Aboriginal health services in both NSW and Victoria have been shifting to telehealth wherever possible to reduce demand on PPE and employing social distancing measures to protect staff and patients., “We’re actually in Ballarat just starting to make our own gowns as well, just in readiness, just in case we need them,” Heap said. “We’re hoping we don’t need them, but if we do, we’ve got some people in our community who can sew, so we’ve put them to task,”, But Heap said if more equipment was not received soon, the consequences would be serious., “We just won’t be able to test at all and we’ll have to be very careful about who we see through the clinic, especially people with the symptoms of the virus,” she said., The release of PPE from the federal government’s national medical stockpile – a reserve of medical equipment held in secret locations across the country – is being prioritised to those who need it most., The government has identified Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as a high-risk group during the Covid-19 pandemic, because of overall higher rates of respiratory disease, heart disease, and diabetes, as well as overcrowded housing., A taskforce of experts in Indigenous health and epidemiology advising the national cabinet has released a detailed plan for dealing with the virus, which recommends urgent supplies of PPE and other medical equipment to regional and remote areas., But, in a further sign of the severity of PPE shortages among Aboriginal medical services, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard and Aboriginal affairs minister Don Harwin wrote to federal health minister Greg Hunt asking for help last week., It is understood the pair asked the federal government to urgently increase the supply of PPE to Aboriginal community-controlled health services in NSW., They also asked that changes be made to allow Aboriginal medical services direct access to the national medical stockpile – an emergency reserve of medical equipment – rather than having to make their requests through the primary health network., Such allowances have already been made for the aged care sector., A NSW Health spokeswoman said the state and federal governments were working together to “urgently increase the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services”., The state government has also provided a “one-off supply” of PPE to the sector in the week beginning 23 March, the spokeswoman said., Hunt on Sunday announced that about 11m masks had recently been distributed to frontline workers, and that the national medical stockpile had been replenished by the receipt of 30m masks in recent weeks., A spokeswoman said 1.6m surgical and P2 masks had been distributed to the NSW government in recent days., “Significant additional supplies of masks have now arrived in Australia and the government is working with states and territories to allocate an initial additional 10 million masks to support front line healthcare professionals,” she said., “There are global shortages of masks and other PPE and the government is securing supplies to meet the demand of states and territories.”, Hunt expects to make up to 200m masks available by the end of the year and finance minister, Mathias Cormann, announced an additional $800m for PPE supply on the weekend., The government has attempted to help local manufacturers to pivot into PPE production and help existing producer Med-Con to boost its output., The Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW last week warned that clinics require urgent action to boost PPE stocks.lack of ppe forces aboriginal health groups to stop testing for coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-295": {"text": "\nGuardian Essential poll: coronavirus response boosts Scott Morrison’s approval rating\n, PM’s approval climbs from 41% to 59% with support from voters across the political spectrum , \nMalcolm Farr, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 13.30 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 01.14 EDT\n\n, Scott Morrison’s approval has been boosted sharply by his management of the Covid-19 response with a substantial number of Labor and Green voters joining the applause., The prime minister’s national approval jumped from 41% in March to 59% this month, according to Essential Research polling released Tuesday., His disapproval rating shrank from 49% to 31% over the same period., But the prime minister’s performance has not eased our concerns about the coronavirus threat.

Even though its products are only available to so-called “wholesale” investors who who have assets of at least $2.5m or are able to tip $500,000 into a single investment, Mayfair 101 advertised heavily in mass circulation newspapers including Brisbane tabloid the Courier Mail., Mawhinney again caused waves in October when, as well as throwing a lavish party on Dunk Island attended by Instagram influencers, MP Bob Katter and singer Ricki-Lee Coulter, he pledged to buy up more than 230 properties, worth $135m, in nearby Mission Beach., The buying spree caused a rush for the exit among locals and divided the community between sceptics and people who bought into Mawhinney’s dream of revitalising the entire Mission Beach area., Recently, the group has been advertising its products as a way to keep ahead during the coronavirus pandemic, but it has also delayed settlements on properties at Mission Beach., A fortnight ago, the federal court banned Asic from issuing a public warning about Mayfair 101’s products without first giving it two days’ notice., But Asic’s new legal action, which follows two years of investigations into the Mayfair 101 group, dramatically escalates the battle between the regulator and the fund., The lawsuit centres on two Mayfair 101 products, M+ Fixed Income and M Core Fixed Income., In a concise statement of claim, filed with the court, Asic objected to the use of phrases including “term deposit alternative”, “certainty” and “confidence” in promotions for the products., It also objected to Mayfair 101 marketing the products using Google Adword keywords including “bank deposits” and “term deposits”, as well as meta-tags – keywords on pages that aren’t displayed but are used by search engines to categorise websites – including “term deposit rates – best term deposit options”., The products “were marketed to wholesale but inexperienced investors, at least a substantial subset of whom were unlikely to understand the significant risk associated with” them, Asic alleged., It also alleged Mayfair 101 “made representations to consumers that the Mayfair products were comparable to, and of similar risk profile to, bank term deposits” when they actually had far higher risk., Mayfair froze redemptions of the two products on 11 March., Asic said 185 investors tipped a total of $73m into M+ Fixed Income Notes while 96 investors poured $67.6m into M Core Fixed Income Notes., Because of Mayfair’s freeze, 12 investors have been unable to redeem $4.4m from their M+ Fixed Income Notes, it said., Mayfair 101 has been approached for comment.asic sues investment fund mayfair 101 for allegedly misleading advertising", "label": 0}, "train-297": {"text": "\nThe devastating impact of Covid-19 in New York\n, With more than 4,000 deaths and a staggering 122,000 cases across the state, New York has now overtaken Wuhan in terms of the sheer number of Covid-19 patients.

There are 96 people in intensive care, with 35 on ventilators., Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof Paul Kelly warned that anyone, regardless of age, could be vulnerable to the virus. , “This is not just an old person’s disease,” he said., “This is something that can affect the whole of our population and that is why we need the whole of the population to continue to take this seriously.”, Kelly said it was important to note the small cohort of young people had no additional risk factors., “This is a disease which mostly is mild, but on some occasions we have seen and will continue to see people with severe disease,” he said., Kelly said increased cases meant a higher chance of younger people without vulnerability contracting a serious infection., “This is a wake-up call for all of us,” he said., Long lines have formed outside supermarkets after Coles, Woolworths and IGA began limiting the number of customers inside stores in a bid to allow physical distancing and keep flattening the curve of Covid-19 infections during the Easter rush., The Thursday before Easter is traditionally one of the busiest days for supermarkets, as people stock up for the weekend., However, in an attempt to avoid overcrowding, a number of Australian supermarkets have instituted “one in one out” policies., Celebrated New South Wales Rural Fire Services boss Shane Fitzsimmons has made the “absolutely difficult and deeply personal” decision to step down, and will instead head up a new agency aimed at ensuring the state’s resilience amid major challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic., The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced the establishment of Resilience NSW on Monday, saying it would ensure the state was prepared and able to respond to crises – “be it Covid, be it cybersecurity, be it a whole range of things we may not foreshadow”., The prevalence of Covid-19 in Australia could peak in mid-April and new cases reduce to almost zero by July, according to modelling by the University of Sydney., But the story doesn’t end there: without widespread testing to detect asymptomatic cases of Covid-19, and a firm hold on social distancing measures that remain in place up to four weeks after the person with the last known infection has recovered, the curve will shoot back up., “That’s pretty much the exit strategy,” said Prof Mikhail Prokopenko, a pandemic modelling expert and the director of the Centre for Complex Systems at Sydney University, who is leading the modelling team. “It must be based in testing.”, The modelling is based on 90% compliance with social distancing rules., Peter Collignon, professor of infectious disease at Australian National University Medical School writes that some of Australia’s recently introduced restrictions “appear more as a result of panicked political decisions rather than based on biological plausibility or evidence”., “Some states have now put in overzealous rules and ones that give very mixed messages or have little biological plausibility. Not only will this cause unwarranted and increased social, mental and economic harm, we run the bigger risk that a substantial part of our society in a few months’ time (our winter) might increasingly rebel against many restrictions., “I hope NSW and Victoria can be persuaded to relax on their overzealous restrictions so recently and unnecessarily put in place.”, Globally, there have been 69,498 deaths from Covid-19 (at the time of publishing), and more than 1.25m confirmed infections. The British prime minister Boris Johnson has been hospitalised after showing persistent symptoms of the virus more than 10 days after announcing he had tested positive., Donald Trump said the US government had ordered 29m doses of hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria for which testing for its use to treat coronavirus is still under way. The drug has potentially harmful side-effects. Personal protective gear is also being airlifted to US affected states, including millions of masks, gloves, and sterile gowns., Australia’s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions, Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics, Australia’s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines, Free childcare: what do the Australian government’s coronavirus changes mean for my family?, Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

The video suggested some stores would have markings on the ground directing people where to stand while queuing in order to properly space out the line. A spokesperson said in-store security would help maintain physical distancing., Woolworths said that they would “work closely with local centre management security and police to help manage queues outside the store at peak times to ensure customers are keeping at least 1.5 meters apart from each other.”, Similar rules have already been introduced at Bunnings. Posts on social media show lines stretching for hundreds of metres, and customers complaining of hour-long waits to enter stores., No snags, but big lines at @Bunnings today.Customer numbers limited in-store: 1 out, 1 in; 4 customers per aisle.Similar rules soon to be rolled out at @Coles &amp; @woolworths Details @7NewsBrisbane tonight at 6pm pic.twitter.com/0a5E9tL0vk, “The lines at Bunnings are enormous, they’re larger than most Dreamworld rides,” one person posted to Facebook., “Victoria police, if you want revenue just go down to your local Bunnings and ask what people are there for. If they are there to buy a plant then hit them up for a fine.”, A spokeswoman for Coles said in order to combat lengthy wait times, the company has been encouraging customers to do their Easter weekend shopping earlier to avoid stores being overwhelmed on Thursday., Business hours for the major supermarkets have been extended to 10pm, and some Coles stores will remain open to midnight over the Easter weekend., In addition to these measures, from Monday, disabled Australians on the NDIS scheme will be able to access priority home delivery from Australia’s major supermarkets., NDIS participants will be sent a unique code by SMS, which they can enter at the end of their online shopping order to access the program., This is in addition to supermarkets instituting priority shopping hours for elderly and disabled people, and frontline medical workers., Australian Associated Press contributed to this report.long queues as australian supermarkets coronavirus coles woolworths iga limit customers to avoid overcrowding in lead up to easter", "label": 0}, "train-300": {"text": "George Pell’s bid for freedom: high court verdict to decide cardinal's future, Australian high court’s decision is Pell’s last chance to overturn conviction for historical child sexual abuse, On Tuesday, almost two years after being committed to stand trial on multiple charges of historical child sexual abuse, the case against the former financial controller of the Vatican, Cardinal George Pell, will likely end with him either walking free or remaining in jail to serve the rest of his sentence., After failing to appeal to Victoria’s appellate court in August, Pell’s legal team took his case to the high court, the final avenue in his bid for freedom. Across two days in March, the full bench of seven justices heard Pell’s barrister Bret Walker SC argue that Victoria’s appellate judges, who dismissed Pell’s first appeal in 2019 by a majority of two-to-one, may have been unduly influenced by the complainant’s testimony by watching a recorded video of it rather than just reading the transcript of his evidence., Walker also argued that just because the complainant was believable and compelling, it should not have led jurors to discount other evidence that placed his evidence in doubt. The director of the Office of Public Prosecutions, Kerri Judd, responded by saying that given Pell’s legal team made so much of the complainant’s lack of credibility and believability, Victoria’s appellate court was entitled to watch the video. It did not mean they had elevated it above other evidence, or that they had not given due weight to other evidence from the trial, she said. She added that the entire body of evidence considered together gave weight to the complainant’s account, rather than discrediting it., Once they return to court on Tuesday the high court bench will immediately deliver its decision as to whether the majority of the seven justices accepts the arguments from Pell’s team and will acquit and release him, or whether the majority dismissed the appeal in which case the guilty verdict will hold and Pell’s opportunities to appeal will have been exhausted., Because of Covid-19 and travel restrictions, it will be difficult for media and the public to attend the decision even though it is being delivered in an open court. Social distancing requirements mean only a handful of people will be able to be in the court room in Brisbane, where the decision is being delivered. The court is not equipped to provide a livestream of the proceedings., The judgment delivery itself will be over in a minute or two, with just the orders being read out by the chief justice Susan Kiefel. The judgment summary will then go live on the court’s website, with the bench’s full reasons for their judgement becoming available shortly after., While there are a few different scenarios that could unfold, including the court granting leave to appeal on only certain convictions and not others, or sending the original appeal back to court to be reconsidered, the most likely scenarios are that the bench will either grant the appeal and quash the conviction, or refuse the appeal, upholding the conviction., Nothing can be read into the timing of the decision coming just three weeks after the hearing in Canberra – it is impossible to predict what the bench will decide. But once the decision comes and the case is over, the child abuse royal commission will be able to release its redacted report into its findings regarding Pell., Australia’s child sexual abuse royal commission, a five-year inquiry into abuses of children in institutional settings including religious ones, redacted large sections of its findings relating to Pell when it handed down its final report in 2017, so as not to influence or jeopardise the legal action., Pell, Australia’s most senior Catholic, was in December 2018 convicted on five charges. A Melbourne jury found him guilty of sexually abusing two 13-year-old choir boys in the priest’s sacristy of St Patrick’s cathedral after Sunday solemn mass when he was the Archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. He then assaulted one of the boys again a few weeks later. Pell is just over one year in to serving a six-year prison sentence, with a non-parole period of three years and eight months.george pells bid for freedom high court verdict to decide disgraced cardinals future", "label": 0}, "train-301": {"text": "\nStates modify assessments to ensure year 12 students finish school this year\n, State and federal education ministers will meet on Tuesday to canvass further changes, including extending the academic year or postponing final exams amid coronavirus crisis, • Follow Australia’s coronavirus live updates• Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email, Australian Associated Press, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 00.38 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 19.00 EDT\n\n, Requirements for year 12 assessments are being modified, with some states dropping drama performances or extending assignment deadlines, ahead of ministerial talks aimed at ensuring final year students finish school this year despite the mayhem caused by coronavirus., Concerns have been raised about how the disruption caused by Covid-19 could damage year 12 results., State and federal ministers will meet on Tuesday to canvass options including extending the academic year or postponing final exams., They will also discuss boosting overall scores and changing university application procedures., Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has floated the possibility of extending year 12 into next year, but his federal counterpart is not keen., “All options will be considered tomorrow when we meet – that is an outlier option – that is in a very worst-case scenario,” federal education minister Dan Tehan told Seven on Monday., “The hope is that we will be able to get everyone through this year.”, State and territory curriculum and assessment authorities will present all available options to the meeting., Some states have already begun to implement their own responses to the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on the school year., The Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority told principals last week that it would drop one of the summative internal assessments for both general and applied subjects from the assessment requirements for senior students, meaning results in those subjects will be calculated from two internal assessments and one external assessment for general subjects, and three internal assessments for applied subjects., The University of Tasmania has introduced a schools recommendation program, which will allow students to be admitted into most courses (excluding quota courses like medicine) based on a recommendation from their school, not just their results., In NSW, the mandatory performance exam in drama and ensemble performance exam in music extension have been cancelled. A Covid-19 committee made up of education officials in the state will be meeting later this week to discuss what will happen to major projects due as part of the HSC for visual arts, design and tech, industrial technology, textiles and design, English extension 2, and society and culture., Mandatory work placement for vocational education and training is no longer required., NSW, Victoria and the ACT have all put procedures in place giving principals flexibility over the assessment tasks for the HSC, including over what needs to be completed and when it is due, and its overall weighting in the final result., South Australian premier Steven Marshall said on Monday it was the intention that term 2 would commence as normal when asked whether any students would need to repeat a year as a result of the Covid-19 crisis., The state’s education minister, John Gardner, told Guardian Australia the state would seek consistency nationally on Atar, but would still keep responsibility for its school certificate., The Atar process was expected to run as usual, with some potential changes to the timeframe, if necessary. The South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) board will be working with teachers to ensure a fair assessment of students in this time, he said., “They have been working closely with the state’s teachers to ensure we have a fair school based assessment, which makes up 70% of a student’s assessed work towards their results, while also working to ensure that exams reflect the learning that is undertaken this year,” he said., “I will be fully supportive of the approach that the SACE Board wants to take.”, A spokeswoman for the WA education department said any change in policy would be announced by the state’s education minister., Tehan said it was likely responses to the pandemic would vary between jurisdictions., “But there is a collective will amongst all education ministers for us to be able to ensure that all those Year 12 students will be able to complete their studies this year,” he said., “And then go on to university, vocational education or employment next year.”, Universities themselves are keeping a close eye on how the virus and disruptions are playing out for their potential graduates., But the sector’s peak body says it’s still too early to know what concessions might have to be given., “This unprecedented situation is changing so rapidly that the impacts on both universities and schools six, nine and 12 months from now just aren’t possible to predict,” Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson said., “However, universities are nonetheless aware of the potential impact of Covid-19 on school examinations and are developing contingency plans.

Savage denies any involvement., During the 10-day hearing earlier this year in Downing Street local court, Jubelin aired claims that then-homicide commander Superintendent Scott Cook in 2017 said “no one cares” about the missing toddler., Cook denied the accusation and NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller issued a statement supporting him, describing him as “exemplifying the definition of a leader”., William’s foster mother said Cook made similar remarks to her in 2019.gary jubelin former detective found guilty of illegal recording in william tyrrell case", "label": 0}, "train-303": {"text": "\nNSW Rural Fire Service boss Shane Fitzsimmons steps down to lead new crisis agency\n, The commissioner will head Resilience NSW, which will prepare and respond to major crises like coronavirus, Australian Associated Press, \n\nSun 5 Apr 2020 22.20 EDT\n\n\nFirst published on Sun 5 Apr 2020 21.17 EDT\n\n, Celebrated New South Wales Rural Fire Services boss Shane Fitzsimmons has made the “absolutely difficult and deeply personal” decision to step down, and will instead head up a new agency aimed at ensuring the state’s resilience amid major challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic., The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced the establishment of Resilience NSW on Monday, saying it would ensure the state was prepared and able to respond to crises – “be it Covid, be it cybersecurity, be it a whole range of things we may not foreshadow”., She said Fitzsimmons – “one of the true heroes of NSW” – would become the agency’s commissioner in about a month after deciding to retire from his position with the RFS., “Who would have thought that in 2020, NSW would be facing a pandemic,” Berejiklian said., “We don’t know the challenges of the future but what I do know is that NSW, through Resilience NSW, will be able to focus on preparing and recovering from anything that comes our way.”, Fitzsimmons, 51, has been widely praised for his leadership during the horror bushfire season just ended., He said the decision to step down as commissioner and move on to a new role was “absolutely difficult and deeply personal, but it’s the right one”. , “It’s been a privilege and an absolute honour to have served in this organisation alongside so many tens of thousands of wonderful individuals, and in particular a privilege to lead the organisation as commissioner for over a decade,” Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney on Monday., “I’ve seen very much this past season - the worst that mother nature can deliver - but I also saw the very best in our people.”, Fitzsimmons said drought-stricken communities had been “belted by bushfires” only for the extraordinary Covid-19 impact to compound the situation further., “I very much care about and am concerned for the people of NSW ... and there is no doubt in my mind that I take on this new role with a deal of trepidation of course,” he said., “But I’m very open to the idea of continuing to make a meaningful difference in the lives and livelihoods of people, of communities, to help with business, to help with industry, and to help rebuild our economy.”, He added in a statement that Resilience NSW would lead a whole-of-government prevention, preparedness and recovery effort, and oversee emergency management policy, service delivery and all aspects of disaster recovery., Fitzsimmons joined the RFS in 1985 and held a number of senior roles until his appointment as commissioner in 2008., Emergency services minister David Elliott thanked him on Monday for his service., “I don’t think there’s a single person who would disagree that commissioner Fitzsimmons’ leadership was a beacon of hope during our state’s darkest hour,” Elliott said., He said Rob Rogers would take over the role of NSW RFS commissioner, after 40 years as a member and nine years as deputy commissioner.nsw rural fire service boss shane fitzsimmons steps down to lead new crisis agency", "label": 0}, "train-304": {"text": "\nRuby Princess docks at NSW port for 10 days but crew must remain on board coronavirus-stricken cruise ship\n, Sick patients being treated on board in Port Kembla or transferred to hospital as NSW government works with owners to repatriate 1,400 crew, • Follow Australia’s coronavirus live updates• Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email, \nAnne Davies, \n\nSun 5 Apr 2020 21.17 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 20 Apr 2020 00.12 EDT\n\n, The Covid-19 stricken cruise ship Ruby Princess berthed at Port Kembla near Wollongong on Monday morning and will likely stay for 10 days as health officials and doctors continue to manage the outbreak of infection on board., On Monday 200 of the 1,400-strong crew on board were showing symptoms., Sick patients were being treated on board or transferred to hospital if needed, while the whole crew was being placed in isolation. The New South Wales government is now working with the ship’s owner, Carnival Australia, on plans to repatriate the crew, who come from 50 countries., NSW police said in a statement the vessel might remain in place for up to 10 days, but the crew would not disembark unless in an emergency and approved by the police commissioner, Mick Fuller., “She will also be refuelling and restocking provisions, as required for her home journey, the statement said., “The berthing will be conducted under strict health and biosecurity guidelines and will not pose a risk to employees at the port or the broader community.”, Members of the crew could be seen waving from separate cabins as the ship pulled in on Monday morning., The government hopes that a period of isolation and intensive screening will provide a pathway to allow the Ruby Princess’s crew to leave Australia., But the Labor frontbencher Ryan Park, whose Keira electorate covers port Kembla, accused the Berejiklian government of moving the ship so it was “out of sight out of mind”., He said the hospitals in the Illawarra would be unable to handle an influx of patients from the Ruby Princess. , All other cruise ships have left NSW waters, heading towards ports in Asia after a weekend operation to transfer crews between ships in order to facilitate their return to their home countries., “There are no cruise ships left in NSW waters other than the Ruby Princess”, Fuller said., “As you are aware, between the NSW government and the Australian government we contracted Aspen, an independent medical group, who went on the ship and they delivered a report to both federal and state government,” he said., “Between NSW Health, the NSW police and the emergency management team a plan has been developed that will be around isolation on the ship,” he said., “From that 10-day period of isolation we can then continue to work with Carnival in relation to repatriation of the individuals on the ship., “Obviously the health and wellbeing of the crew members is essential,” he said. There would be the “highest level of security for the locals down in southern NSW”., Fuller said the government had taken the decision to dock the Ruby Princess because of the regular supplies that need to go to the ship and because transfers at sea were a complex and dangerous task., Another two crew members were taken off the ship on Sunday requiring additional medical assistance., A criminal investigation is under way to find out how the Ruby Princess was permitted to undertake a second cruise departing in March, when it had identified cases of flu-like illness on a previous cruise. There are also serious questions being asked about why passengers were allowed to disembark on 19 March without detailed health checks. Like all returning passengers they were told to self-isolate, so the community spread appears to be minimal at this stage., A total of 662 people linked to the cruise ship have been infected with Covid-19 and 11 passengers have died., The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said on Saturday that if NSW Health had known coronavirus was on board the ship, officials would have disembarked the passengers differently and moved them directly to self-isolation., But she said that would have only prevented 11 known cases of the virus that were subsequently spread within the community., “Cases that we could have averted by decanting people in a more ordered way with face masks and taking them directly to their homes, would have been in the order of 11,” Chant said., ruby princess cruise ship dock port kembla nsw 10 days doctors manage coronavirus outbreak australia", "label": 0}}
