The records also list its principal place of business as Briggs’ family home in Sydney’s Sutherland Shire., Removing donations from a party’s annual return takes some time. No change had yet been made at 9am Thursday. , Evidence that it was originally declared by the Liberal party before being later deleted will remain on the Australian electoral commission’s website permanently. , The plan to privatise Australia’s visa processing system has been met with significant criticism. It has prompted fears that thousands of jobs will be lost and sensitive private information will be compromised., The main public service union, the Community and Public Sector Union, has warned it will give private companies too much of a say over who is allowed to come to Australia., Briggs’ consortium Australian Visa Processing Pty Ltd is one of two key players vying for the visa privatisation contract., Any suggestion of a conflict has been hotly disputed by Coalition ministers, who say Morrison has no role in deciding the tender. Morrison and Coleman have reportedly removed themselves from any cabinet and expenditure review committee discussions about the contract., Similar privatisation in the United Kingdom has led to exorbitant costs and extensive delays for migrants seeking visas., Freedom of information documents released last year showed that legislative change would be needed to privatise the visa system. That could delay the government’s plans considerably, because Labor and key crossbenchers have indicated their opposition., On Tuesday, Giles issued a statement criticising the Liberal party’s acceptance of donations from Pacific Blue Capital., “This is a terrible look – trust in the political system is already at an all-time low,” Giles said. “The last thing Australia needs is our visa system being sold off to the highest bidder.”, The department of home affairs says it would retain control of visa decisions under the new system. It says it has already spent more than $80m on the system’s design and procurement., Western Sydney University academics Marina Khan and Shanthi Robertson wrote in December that the privatisation would create significant risks., “Home Affairs claims privatisation will improve efficiency and reduce costs,” they wrote for The Conversation. “But it also comes with major risks, some we’ve seen already play out in the privatisation of immigration control through commercialised immigration detention, such as on Christmas Island.”, “These risks include corruption, consumer protection issues and damage to the overall integrity of the visa system.”liberal party refuses questions over 165k donation by morrison ally bidding for 1bn visa privatisation contract", "label": 0}, "train-11": {"text": "\n'Hysterical and ruinous': Christmas Island furious over Australia's coronavirus plans\n, \n'Hysterical and ruinous': Christmas Island furious over Australia's coronavirus plans\n, There is disquiet over the decision to quarantine Wuhan evacuees on an island that thought it had left behind its prison image, \nBen Doherty on Christmas Island, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 21.07 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 06.58 EDT\n\n, “We are a colony. That’s how we are treated.”, In 22 years on this island, Gordon Thomson, president of Christmas Island shire and head of the island’s workers’ union, has fought and lost too many battles with the commonwealth of Australia for diplomatic niceties., “The commonwealth is all-powerful on this island, and they are exerting all of their authority to run this operation,” he says of the latest incarnation of the island’s immigration detention centre, as a quarantine station for Australians evacuated from the global centre of the coronavirus, Wuhan in China., “The whole world is looking at Australia and seeing again that people are being incarcerated on Christmas Island. It’s a hysterical response, and it’s going to be ruinous to our tourist industry.”, Thomson may be firebrand in his rhetoric. But he is not alone in his sentiment. Through Christmas Islanders, runs a streak of independence., Born perhaps of a community forged in isolation, a colonial history that saw Malay and Chinese workers brought to work on British-run mines in the late 19th century, those who now live on Australia’s most remote inhabited territory have a keen sense of their own island identity, one keenly distinct from that on “the mainland”., CI has its own number plates, its own robber crab road signs, its own time zone., Ever-present here is a sense of being separate ... even separatist., The island itself rises imperiously from the waters of the Indian Ocean, sharp green hills of dramatic rock escarpment dripping in dense and unforgiving forest. Human settlement clings, almost apologetically, to the narrow edges. It is a land dominated by nature not by humankind., Hidden at the farthest point of the island is the Australian government’s immigration detention centre, repurposed this week as a quarantine facility, housing 270 Australian citizens and permanent residents who have been evacuated from Wuhan, in China’s central Hubei province, the centre of the global coronavirus epidemic. More could yet join., Before Thursday, the centre had fallen into something of a torpor: staffed by more than 100 people, it housed the loneliest asylum seekers in Australia’s arcane system: the Murugappan family – Nades, Priya and their Australian-born children Kopika and Tharunicaa – far from their home in Biloela, Queensland as they await a court hearing on the mainland., People are not happy about this. The Australian government just does whatever it wants to us., A surprising number of islanders tell Guardian Australia they’ve never been to or seen the centre, but, to the outside world, the immigration detention centre has become almost representative, almost definitional: the one thing that is known about Christmas Island., The immigration detention centre is absent from day-to-day life on Christmas Island, the remotest part of an already remote part of the world. But while the island and the centre are separate, they are almost inextricably bound., VIRUS ISLAND, the front page of the West Australian screamed in 100-point type the morning the first planeload of evacuees touched down. The reaction on Christmas Island was apoplectic. Local message boards lit up in furious response., “Very, very unfair,” a Malay woman who has lived for decades on Christmas Island, tells Guardian Australia, declining to give her name because of employment sensitivities., “Other people are angry that our island is being used for this. I don’t mind that the detention centre is being used: these people are Australian and we have got to help them. I’ve got children and I can imagine if my children were stuck there. But to make it sound like the whole island has coronavirus, that it’s all of us, hurts us. We love our island.”, At the Halal cafe in Flying Fish Cove, David Chan says the detention centre is, again, dominating life on Christmas Island., “Everyone on this island is talking about it. What should I do, should I be worried, do I need to be worried for my children? We don’t know., “People are not happy about this. The Australian government just does whatever it wants to us, it never asks us what we want.”, Chan stresses too that islanders are happy to help, to play their part in Australia’s response to the virus. He says the island bears no ill will to those brought here for quarantine (people of Chinese origin are the largest population group on Christmas Island). He just wishes the island had been asked., There is also a sense of yet further unthinking insensitivity. It is the tail end of the crab migration season here and hundreds of crabs remain on the roads. Islanders have been upset to find that convoys to the detention centre have run over up to half a dozen of the island’s famous robber crabs – far rarer than the red crabs and which are legally protected – and can live for up 80 years., But the disquiet over the latest imposition of federal government policy on the island community comes with a wearied resignation, a recognised powerlessness., “They have the power to do what they like, I just wish they would tell us, talk to us,” says Othman Dardak, a former councillor and member of the Islamic council of the island., “As Christmas Islanders, we have no voice in what happens to our own island, our own land.”, He says he worries for the reputation of the island, both in Australia and internationally. In the years following 2001, when immigration detention began on the island, the island was shorthand for Australia’s toxic political debate around asylum seekers and refugees: now it is known for the coronavirus., “We are all happy here, we are living a good life, but for people outside, all they know is detention centre and now coronavirus.”, Across the island, Guardian Australia is told there has been little communication from the federal government about what is happening on their island, and how concerned, if at all, they should be., A flyer posted at the Christmas Island recreation centre says “engagement with the Christmas Island community is an important part of planning” for the quarantine regime., “The government is focused on helping these Australians as quickly as possible … as Christmas Island residents, your support is greatly appreciated.”, The administrator of the island, former federal Liberal MP Natasha Griggs, has said in correspondence with the shire: “I understand the Christmas Island community is concerned about plans to establish coronavirus quarantine activities on island for Australians travelling from Wuhan/Hubei … please rest assured that the Christmas Island community will be provided updates and further information as it comes to hand.”, In previous incarnations of the detention centre – when it housed several hundred asylum seekers and others and its operation was fiercely controversial – former administrators held regular public meetings at the island’s tiny courthouse., That hasn’t happened this time. Local government is being excluded too, Thomson says., Usually, Christmas Island shire has responsibility for managing waste from the detention centre. When the shire inquired what it should do during the quarantine period, it was told simply waste would be “managed by the Department of Defence in line with guidance from the Department of Health”., But the anxiety over the coronavirus quarantine feeds, too, into a broader concern about the future of the island., Phosphate mining remains the major industry on the island – yellow and blue high-vis shirts dominate backs and clotheslines all over – but as production winds down, including a months-long shutdown last year and this, the industry counts its future in years, not decades., The question is being asked: “What next does this island do?”, Tourism is the obvious answer. The remote beauty of the island, its forests, snorkelling and the red crab migration, are all attractions, but the detention centre, hidden away at the end of the island, somehow looms large still., “For years this place was known as an island of incarceration. We were emerging from that and, while this is short-term and the reasons are different, again, all that people are hearing about Christmas Island is people being incarcerated again,” Thomson says., He argues Christmas Island is a non-self-governing territory and should be placed on the United Nations of those territories that have the right to a vote on independence., He believes there is significant support across the island for a “free association” with Australia, as the Marshall Islands does with the US, and Tokelau with New Zealand – a political arrangement which would give the island greater autonomy and control over its own land., “That way, we’d have a say in what happens here.”hysterical and ruinous christmas island faces its coronavirus moment", "label": 0}, "train-12": {"text": "\n'These children are in limbo': the New Zealanders locked out of Australia's NDIS\n, Children with disabilities who were born or have lived in Australia most of their lives are being denied access to disability support. A lawsuit aims to challenge the ‘blatantly unfair’ regime, \nDenham Sadler, \n\nFri 28 Feb 2020 12.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2020 16.27 EST\n\n, Three days after Emma de Tracy Gould’s 17th birthday in December, she found out she would get no Australian government support for her disability., Emma was diagnosed last year with Ehlers Danlos syndrome, a rare genetic condition caused by defects in the collagen protein. She has joint hypermobility, soft skin that stretches easily, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and hips and a left shoulder that dislocate multiple times each week. She also experiences chronic fatigue., Emma had hoped to get a new wheelchair to help with her mobility and independence while completing year 11, along with financial assistance for a carer and regular specialist appointments., Emma lives in Swan Valley, Perth, with her mother, Michaela, who is a permanent resident. But because Emma is a New Zealand citizen on a special category visa, she is ineligible for Australia’s national disability insurance scheme., Emma and her younger brother were both born in Nelson before her family moved to Perth in 2010., New Zealanders are able to live permanently in Australia, automatically receiving a special category visa on arrival. But under changes made by the Howard government in 2001, those holding this visa are locked out of many Australian social security and welfare payments, including housing assistance, university loans and the NDIS., In many cases, New Zealanders have lived in Australia for several years, had children in the country and contributed to the funding of the NDIS through the Medicare levy, but are unable to access it if their children need assistance., “All these children are in limbo-land at the moment, and somebody needs to stand up and take responsibility for them,” Michaela de Tracy Gould says. “They’re all slipping through the cracks at the moment.”, Emma needs to use a wheelchair to travel more than 200m. She currently uses one that weighs 14kg and is the wrong size, borrowed from a family friend. But this greatly restricts her independence. She has been recently prescribed a new wheelchair by her occupational therapist, weighing half as much., “It would be a massive difference,” Emma says. “With my current wheelchair I can’t be independent.”, But the wheelchair costs more than $10,000, a figure the family can’t afford without government assistance. They have now launched a crowdfunding campaign to try to raise the money., After being knocked back by the NDIS, the family applied for the state-based equivalent, the WANDIS. At the end of last year they were also rejected for this after it was ruled that Emma’s condition was not ongoing and that she would be better in two years, despite her specialists contradicting that prognosis. Emma’s family is appealing against the decision., “It’s frustrating,” Emma says. “It’s a genetic disorder that often gets worse with age, but they told me it would get better.”, There are many other families in a similar situation, many of whom have lived in Australia for several years., Julie Goble’s daughter Maylea, who is now 18-months-old, was diagnosed with left-side hemiplegic cerebral palsy in March last year, when she was just five months old. It’s a permanent condition that has left her unable to use the left side of her body., She has to receive expensive physiotherapy and occupational therapy, with specialists regularly espousing the importance of early intervention medical treatment to improve Maylea’s long-term quality of life., But because Goble and her family are living on special category visas, they are also restricted from receiving any support from the NDIS., It’s really cruel to deny her all of the possibilities and all of the things that she would benefit and flourish from, “It’s heartbreaking,” Goble says. “It’s really cruel to deny her all of the possibilities and all of the things that she would benefit from and flourish from., “She certainly doesn’t have as much physiotherapy as I would like her to have – we just can’t afford to be going more than once a fortnight. And she is definitely not having as much at-home physiotherapy as she should be.”, Children born in Australia to New Zealand parents become eligible for Australian citizenship when they turn 10, which then allows them to access the NDIS, but Goble says that possibility is too remote to offer Maylea effective help., “If we have to sit around and do nothing and wait until she’s 10 years old, her mobility and ability to do things for herself is going to be vastly different,” Goble says. , The lack of access to the NDIS is likely to feature prominently in an upcoming legal challenge against the citizenship conditions for New Zealanders in Australia. David Faulkner from the lobby group Kiwis in Australia, who is coordinating the challenge, says he has already been approached by several families., “They’re trapped between a rock and a hard place,” Faulkner says. “The NDIS and the regime are blatantly unfair.”, The prominent lawyer Greg Barns has offered pro-bono assistance in the case, which is still in its early days., While there have been some rumblings from the opposition and crossbench, the government appears unlikely to budge.,  A spokesperson for the Department of Social Services said: “The residency requirements ensure the NDIS is targeted at people with disability who will be living in Australia permanently. Residency requirements for the NDIS align with other commonwealth government schemes for people with disability and their carers.”, Special category visa holders are able to apply for permanent residency if they meet certain thresholds, including a salary of at least $53,900 annually for the last four years., Emma de Tracy Gould, who has just started year 11, says the politicians who are in a position to make changes need to better understand what it’s like for the New Zealanders living in Australia with a disability., “They have no idea how exhausting it is to live with a chronic illness already, and we don’t need to have to struggle with this because it makes it even harder.”these children are in limbo the new zealanders locked out of australias ndis", "label": 0}, "train-13": {"text": "\nNot much love actually: Jacinda Ardern was right to call out Australia's 'corrosive' policies\n, The New Zealand prime minister was justified in taking Scott Morrison to task over a policy that is both spurious and damaging, Contact author, \n\nFri 28 Feb 2020 01.12 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2020 01.25 EST\n\n, We’ve seen this movie before., Then, in Love Actually, Hugh Grant played the unlikely prime minister of Britain, standing up to an oleaginous Billy Bob Thornton as president of the US., This time, the backdrop was Sydney Harbour, and the champion of the underdog was New Zealand leader Jacinda Ardern. Scott Morrison was a cornered Australian prime minister, looking around for a ferry, a helicopter, anything, to transport him away: anywhere but here., A smaller country – a junior partner – stood up to an aggressive, domineering senior one, and said: “I fear this has become a bad relationship.” In Ardern’s version: “This is corrosive to our relationship.”, At issue is the deportation of New Zealand citizens – some of them Indigenous Australians, others raised and schooled in Australia and who have barely been to New Zealand – forcibly sent back to a country to which they have no connection after serving a prison sentence in Australia., For many, their country of citizenship is a place they barely know, have no family in or connection to. Some are children still., Ardern told Scott Morrison that Australia’s continued intransigence around the issue had become “corrosive” to the countries’ relationship., “Australia is well within its rights to deport individuals who break your laws,” Ardern said. “New Zealand does the same. But we have a simple request – send back Kiwis. Genuine Kiwis. Do not deport your people and your problems.”, The issue has been a point of simmering tension between the two nations for years, but has erupted into fresh acrimony in recent weeks and become an election issue for Ardern after New Zealand police said the policy was a significant reason behind a rise in domestic criminal gang activity., Ardern said her public evisceration was not without warning, having delivered to Morrison the same message in private. She said New Zealand would not stand for a lack of “fairness” in the relationship, citing cases of people who had moved to Australia when they were one week old being deported back to the land of their birth., Morrison, for his part, was resolute., “Our government is well known for our clear views on immigration and border security. If you have committed a crime and you’re not a citizen of Australia, then you have no right to stay.”, Ardern’s comments must be put in a broader political context. Adored abroad, Ardern has found the travails of domestic politics far more bruising, and finds herself locked in a fierce campaign battle ahead of a September poll., Comments such as these will play strongly to a domestic audience, who will see a prime minister standing up to a bullying big brother., But the broader principle of Ardern’s argument is also significant., The people at the centre of this debate are undeniably “Australian” in the broader sense of a demos, even if they don’t carry the requisite paperwork. These people are products of Australia and are Australia’s responsibility., Often, and all over the world, we see Australia seeking to shed itself of citizens it finds difficult, politically awkward, or unpopular. Australian infants and children trapped in the violence of al-Hawl in northern Syria are shunned because of the mistakes of their parents., But countries are responsible for the people they create., The people at the centre of this debate were, in many cases, raised and schooled entirely in Australia. They fell into crime – some of it petty, some of it serious – in Australia. They have all the family and friends they have ever known in Australia., They are Australian, and they are Australia’s responsibility. Just as parents can’t spurn their children who behave badly, states can’t simply foist people they find difficult onto other countries., The Australian government mounts arguments around national security and safety, but they are spurious, and made for the hackneyed political gain of being seen as tough on crime, and harsh towards “others”., Rarely in international relations are there debates free of nuance, free of grey areas. But Australia is unambiguously in the wrong here, and it has been consistently for years., Its inability to see the harm it is doing to what should be one of its closest, and simplest, relationships, is immensely damaging and self-defeating.not much love actually jacinda ardern was right to call out australias corrosive policies", "label": 0}, "train-14": {"text": "\nJacinda Ardern lashes Scott Morrison for 'testing' friendship over deportations to New Zealand\n, New Zealand PM says Australia is deporting ‘your people and your problems’ using unfair policies, \nAmy Remeikis, \n\nThu 27 Feb 2020 22.48 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2020 04.02 EST\n\n, The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has lashed Scott Morrison for “testing” the friendship between the two nations, accusing Australia of deporting “your people and your problems” using “unfair” policies., Ardern took her strongest stance yet opposing Australia’s policy of deporting New Zealand citizens, no matter how long they had spent in Australia, if they had committed a crime., Standing next to an uncomfortable Australian prime minister, Ardern warned she did not wish to see the traditional allies engage in a tit-for-tat “race to the bottom” over the controversial policy, but warned she would not let the matter drop., New Zealand, she said, took into account a person’s ties to the nation and did not deport those “considered for all intents and purposes to have established themselves as New Zealanders”., Australia needed to do the same, Ardern argued., “I’m not asking that Australia stops the policy,” she said., “You have deported more than 2,000 individuals, and among them will be genuine Kiwis who do need to learn the consequences of their actions., “But among those 2,000 are individuals who are too young to become criminals on our watch, they were too young to become patched gang members, too young to be organised criminals., “We will own our people. We ask that Australia stops exporting theirs., “I want to conclude by just reaffirming something I have said often. We will continue to maintain rights for Australians in New Zealand., “We do not wish to have a race to the bottom. We do remain confident that in time by working together we will find solutions that reaffirm just how important our relationship is to us. And testament to that relationship is the fact that we can raise these issues frankly and we do.”, Ardern said her evisceration was not without warning, having told Morrison the same thing in private. But she said New Zealand would not stand for a lack of respect in the relationship, citing cases of people who had moved to Australia when they were one week old being deported back to their birth land., “Australia is well within its rights to deport individuals who break your laws. New Zealand does the same. But we have a simple request – send back Kiwis. Genuine Kiwis. Do not deport your people and your problems.”, Morrison said Australia had no plans to abandon the policy. “The Australian government’s policy is very clear,” he said., “We deport non-citizens who have committed crimes in Australia against our community., “This policy is applied not specific to one country, but to any country whose citizens are here. You commit a crime here, if convicted, once you have done your time, we send you home., “And we would have no objection to any country – anywhere – who would apply the same rule in terms of Australian citizens who commit crimes in other places. We would think that was totally understandable and we wouldn’t take any offence.”, Ardern listened to Morrison’s explanation and said he had solved the issue himself., “The prime minister used a key word in his reference just now – he said that after they have served their time he sends them ‘home’,” she said., “The example I used demonstrates that we have countless who have no home in New Zealand, they have no network, they have grown up in Australia. That is their home. And that is where they should stay.”, The issue has been a point of simmering tension between the two nations for years, but has heated up considerably in recent times, becoming an election issue for Ardern, with New Zealand police pointing to the policy as one of the reasons for a rise in domestic criminal gang activity., While Ardern has vowed to continue fighting against the policy, now having raised the prospect of returning Australians in the same position, Morrison was just as determined to stand his ground, and said policy was not country-specific., “Kiwis become citizens. Indians become citizens. Chinese nationals become citizens,” he said., “And when you become a citizen, well, you have joined the club and if you violate our laws at that point, then that is on our watch and Australia has to take care of those situations., “But if you’re a non-citizen, our very clear view – and our government is well-known for our clear views when it comes to issues of immigration and border security – if you have committed a crime and you’re not a citizen of Australia, then you have no right to stay.”jacinda ardern lashes scott morrison for testing friendship over deportations to new zealand", "label": 0}, "train-15": {"text": "Labor presses officials over sports grants scandal – as it happened, Penny Wong raises questions about possible breaches of ministerial standards.

The reality of Australia’s detention system today, however, is far more harrowing., Nobody understands this better than Sami. Arriving to seek refuge in Australia over five years ago with his heavily pregnant wife, his first child was born into a life of detention. Clutching his newborn shortly after her arrival, he made a desperate, hurried phone call to a lawyer from his compound on the Australian territory of Christmas Island where they had been detained, 1,500kms from the mainland. By the time help arrived it was too late – they’d been frog-marched on to a pre-dawn charter flight to an Australian operated detention centre almost 7,000kms away, on the tiny island nation of Nauru., They were later ping-ponged back to a remote detention centre in the Australian desert, not dissimilar to that depicted in Stateless. His wife’s second pregnancy was deemed too high-risk to occur offshore. Two guards stood on either side of her hospital bed as she held their newborn son, watching as she attempted to breastfeed him for the first time. Her hands shook from fear and shame. The family’s legal team have since done what they can to hold them in Australia, but the risk of return to Nauru remains ever-present. Every day they wake, unsure if today will be the day., This is a family that spent almost two years in closed immigration detention in Australia – in an isolated camp far from the public eye. Both children were born into detention – the eldest spent the first 18 months of her life behind wire. The father tells me he worries about the lasting damage this has done to them. His eldest has developed learning difficulties – the other regularly wakes in terror., In an indication of how fraught Australia’s immigration policy is for people seeking asylum, this family is actually one of the luckier ones. They are now living in the community, albeit in a form of home detention akin to parole – at risk of return to closed detention at any time. According to the government’s most recent statistics, 1,450 men and women are locked up in immigration detention centres on the Australian mainland today – more if we include those who remain in limbo after almost seven years in Nauru and PNG. Two small children are behind bars on Christmas Island – children that belong back in their community of Biloela., The average length of time for people held in Australian detention is currently more than 500 days; shockingly, some have been held for more than eight years. This is far longer than any other comparable jurisdiction. Take, for example, Canada, where the average length of detention is no more than one month., And conditions inside these centres are getting dangerously worse. A recent report by the Australian Human Rights Commission found that our detention system is becoming “more and more like prison”, unlike any other liberal democracy in the world., Stateless is set in 2004. So how is it that 16 years later the situation is so much worse? Toxic politics aside, how is it that this system of indefinite detention is legal? Numerous international bodies have found that it constitutes “arbitrary detention” and in some cases amounts to “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment”. But because we have no national Charter of Rights, these fundamental principles are not binding in Australian law., Indefinite detention is a particular risk for stateless people – those not considered to belong to any nation – for the simple reason that they have nowhere to go.

But an overloaded system that discourages or delays genuine claims disadvantages all asylum claims.”, The apparent link between the online lodgement system and the surge in claims comes despite the government announcing $5m in the 2017-18 budget to “further strengthen the integrity” of the electronic authority system., Keneally also warned that with an increased number of people on bridging visas, the backlog leads to a growing “honeypot” for people smugglers who facilitate travel to Australia for the specific purpose of having an extended stay in our country, often to access the labour market., “As that continues, along with the wilful ignorance on the part of the government, the exploitation of these vulnerable people – a developing economic underclass – will only continue to grow., “Plain and simple – this is a work scam.”, Since taking on the home affairs portfolio, Keneally has been targeting minister Peter Dutton over plane arrivals and the growing number of temporary migrants in Australia, saying their number has doubled since 2007 to 1 million people, or 4% of the population., A large cohort of this is the more than 216,000 people on bridging visas in Australia, with the majority of those waiting for the department of home affairs to process their visa applications., There are also more than 62,000 people who have overstayed their visa living in Australia, and the administrative appeals tribunal has 66,500 cases currently listed before the migration and refugee tribunal of the AAT., She pointed to the “astonishing” fact that the processing time for partner visas had blown out to 31 months, leaving people in a state of “migration limbo”., “Our permanent migration intake has been reduced by the current government whilst the number of temporary migrants in Australia continues to swell,” Keneally said., “The health of Australia’s migration system is dire.”, Labor has established a Senate committee into temporary migration which is examining exploitation of temporary visa holders and the number of airplane arrivals claiming asylum, and how this is flowing through to the Australian economy more broadly., Keneally said the government did not have a plan to stop the “slavery-like conditions” that were afflicting the temporary migrant workforce, and called for increased funding and “identity management improvements” to get on top of the issue., “It’s incumbent on the Morrison government to try and stem these arrivals because a failure to do so will only add to the intractable caseload,” she said.keneally says surge in visitors on

orders release, rejecting argument it would enable detainees to ‘intimidate Serco personnel’, \nJosh Taylor and \nChristopher Knaus, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 22.58 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 23.06 EST\n\n, Home affairs tried to suppress the release of Serco’s immigration detention centre operating manual by arguing it would allow immigration detainees to make human rights complaints as a “means of intimidating Serco personnel”., The Department of Home Affairs and Serco, which helps run Australia’s onshore detention centres, fought for almost three years to keep the company’s detention centre policy and procedure manual secret from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre., They warned the manual, if released to the ASRC through freedom of information laws, would provide a “guidebook of Serco’s operational responsiveness capabilities to detainees and ‘sympathisers of nefarious intent’”, an apparent reference to refugee advocates., The department, speaking on behalf of Serco, sought to characterise detainees as violent, querulous, unpredictable and dangerous, saying one-third had come from prisons and more than half were detained for visa non-compliance., They warned the release of the manual would lead to an increase of complaints to the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Commonwealth Ombudsman., Such complaints, they argued, were used as a deliberate means of pressuring Serco staff and increasing the “administrative burden” on the company., “Several detainees are known or reasonably suspected of creating excessive complaints to external bodies for their stated purpose of causing administrative burden to Serco and the department as a means of intimidating Serco personnel,” Serco and the department argued in their submission to the Information Commissioner., “The release of the documentation would provide querulous detainees with access to a list of specific processes which Serco undertakes in the management of property, recording of personal details, conduct of individual management processes and virtually every other aspect of detainee care, management and interaction.”, Serco and the department argued the “querulants” were likely to base “future false and misleading allegations” against Serco to “stifle the administration capabilities of Serco and the department”., The Information Commissioner, in a decision published last week, rejected the submissions and ordered the document be released., Commissioner Angelene Falk said she was not satisfied the “documents could result in a substantial adverse effect on the safety, security and good order of immigration detention facilities and operations as asserted by the department and Serco”., ASRC principal solicitor, Carolyn Graydon, told Guardian Australia the argument was “ludicrous”., “There’s a complete lack of accountability for the treatment of people in immigration detention centres so it is ludicrous to be turning the argument the other way around, when what is required is a statutory framework for conditions of immigration detention, which we lack in Australia,” she said., “We have common complaints of excessive use of force, common complaints that the risk assessment procedures being used are inappropriate and not reviewable and cannot be obtained under FOI.”, Graydon called for the department to release the document quickly., “It’s about shining a light on the darkest places in relation to the treatment of people in immigration detention,” she said, adding that it puts the argument that the documents should be exempt on commercial grounds “in the bin”., There have been no indications whether the department plans to appeal the decision., Guardian Australia sought comment from both the department and Serco. , Recordings leaked to the Guardian last year showed Serco guards boasting about the ineffectiveness of detainee complaints., In one recording a Serco guard claims he has been the subject of numerous complaints, but none has ever been investigated., “I honestly have no idea how many complaints I’ve ever had,” the guard is recorded as saying. “You know how many times I’ve been investigated? Never.”, “It just gets shut down just like that, because they know I’m doing the job I’m supposed to be doing.”, Serco and the department say the recordings were unverified.home affairs fought for three years to stop serco detention centre manual release", "label": 0}, "train-25": {"text": "\n'Left with nothing': Australia's migrant workforce face destitution without coronavirus safety net\n, The 1.1 million people on temporary work visas have been conspicuously absent from the government’s assistance packages, \nBen Doherty, \nJosh Taylor and \nPaul Karp, \n\nTue 31 Mar 2020 19.18 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 31 Mar 2020 19.26 EDT\n\n, In a week, Popi’s household of full employment went to a bare six hours a week. Four foreign nationals on temporary work visas, they watched in disbelief as, in turn, they endured layoff after layoff after layoff., As the Australian government has swung into action to counter the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic, outlaying public money to support businesses and a new jobkeeper wage subsidy to keep money in the pockets of employees laid off, Australia’s million-strong migrant workforce has been conspicuously absent., There are more than 1.1 million temporary workers in Australia – international students, working holidaymakers, bridging visa holders, those on temporary protection or safe haven visas – most are ineligible for all of the government’s assistance packages., Migrant workers have been acutely affected by the widespread layoffs as a result of Covid-19. Many work in hospitality, retail and services, some of the industries hit hardest by shutdowns, and few have family and community networks they can turn to., Popi, a 24-year-old Argentinian on the second year of a working holiday visa, has had her hours working in a Wollongong cafe cut back to a bare six hours a week, not even enough to cover her rent, and even that is more an act of generosity than economic rationality., “My boss says he would probably be better off closed, but he keeps the cafe open for short hours, just so I, and other workers, have some work, have an income.”, She says her employer, and her community, has rallied to support those hardest hit by the cuts., “We have food in the freezer, food in the fridge, and that’s because people have been helping us. But for a lot of people it’s going to be very, very hard. They have no income at all, and we are watching our savings disappear., “I am constantly talking with my friends and we are trying to support each other, sending messages ‘don’t get to the point of being hungry, we are all here to help’.”, Popi says she is hopeful she might be able to have her rent relaxed, but says other migrant workers face the very real prospect of destitution or being left homeless. Others have spent thousands from dwindling savings accounts trying to book flights home that have ultimately been cancelled., Popi can’t get home. The borders of Argentina are closed, even to citizens, and there are no flights., “Everywhere is closed. There is nowhere I can go.”, More than a million people in Australia on temporary visas are excluded from the government’s jobkeeper and other support payments such as Newstart: about 500,000 international students, 140,000 working holidaymarkers, 120,000 skilled temporary entrants, 200,000 bridging visa holders (largely partner visa applicants or asylum seekers), and more than 16,000 temporary protection visa holders (refugees Australia is legally obliged to protect)., Peter Mares from the Cranlana Centre for Ethical Leadership and the author of Not Quite Australian: How Temporary Migration is Changing the Nation, said governments faced a hugely complex and evolving set of problems trying to counter the economic devastation of the Covid-19 shutdown., But he said Australia had an obligation to support the temporary migrants it had invited into the country and on whose labour the Australian economy depends., “I would argue temporary visa holders need to get some sort of support if they are stuck in Australia and they can’t go home and can’t find work. People cannot be left with nothing, with no income to survive. People also need to be supported as a public health issue., “We’re seeing both the implications of high levels of casualisation in the workforce and high levels of temporary migrant labour in the workforce, and what happens when their jobs suddenly disappear.”, Mares said Covid-19 had wreaked havoc on Australia’s migrant labour market, in some cases in contradictory fashion: some local mayors were telling people “don’t come to our shire”, while farmers in the same shire were urging potential workers “we still need labour”., “In some cases too, we still need that labour, it’s important that produce gets picked, it’s important that temporary visa holders working in aged care or as cleaners in hospitals, stay in that work, that is essential.”, The Council of Small Business Organisations Australia chief executive, Peter Strong, said the ineligibility of most temporary visa workers to access the jobkeeper payment was “definitely a concern”., “Industries have brought these people in to do work, ... we’ve got to look at that, beyond a doubt,” he said., Asked directly on Monday whether temporary visa holders were eligible for the jobkeeper wage subsidy, prime minister Scott Morrison said “such matters are under consideration”., “But for now, the short answer to that is ‘no’.”, British national Niall Harden, a full-time food and beverage supervisor at Hobart’s Museum of Old and New Art, was stood down on 27 March after the museum closed its doors. Harden said he felt well-supported by his employer, which has committed to two weeks’ pay beyond his leave entitlement, but after that, he fears there are few prospects., “I’m looking around for other work but my experience is all in hospitality and tourism which is absolutely dead in the water. The idea of job-hunting in the Tasmanian winter is pretty disheartening. We certainly can’t survive six months with no household income. I haven’t received a reply from our landlord yet about whether we can pay reduced rent.”, Harden says moving back to the UK was not a realistic option – after five years in Australia there is not a physical home to go back to – but may be his only choice., “To pack up five years worth of life and abandon the pathway to permanent residency that has taken so long would seriously impact my mental health, and for what: to go and claim benefits in a different country? And I don’t reckon we’d be eligible for anything there either.”, Harden said he was devastated by Morrison’s response to a question on the situation of visa holders, when the prime minister said New Zealand migrants “have built a life here” in Australia., “It left me feeling physically sick.
