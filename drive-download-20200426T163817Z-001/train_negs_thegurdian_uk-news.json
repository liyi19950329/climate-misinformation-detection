Inquiries are ongoing at this time as part of a full investigation., “We are working alongside Lambeth council to ensure the offensive remarks are removed as soon as possible.”, The Met added: “Shockingly, hate crime affects people from all walks of life and impacts on communities across London. All members of our communities have the right to go about their daily life without fear of verbal, physical or written abuse. The Met does not tolerate any form of discrimination, and we are committed to tackling offences like this as thoroughly as possible.”, The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, tweeted: “Disgusted to hear that Islamophobic slogans have been spray painted near the North Brixton Islamic Centre. @metpoliceuk are working with Lambeth Council to have them removed, but let me be clear: all prejudice is cowardly and criminals will face the full force of the law.”, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary and frontrunner for Labour’s vacant position of deputy leader, echoed Khan’s words, saying: “Islamophobic hate is not acceptable and should not be tolerated, it is disgusting, hate has no place in our society and we should always challenge it whenever it occurs.”, Councillor Mohammed Seedat, Lambeth’s cabinet member for community safety, said: “Many of our residents fear they are living in a hostile environment. The intimidating racist graffiti on synagogues and mosques won’t divide Londoners, but will confirm the worst fears of many of our residents., “The council and police will continue to reassure communities. But we also need politicians, particularly the government, to act responsibly in rhetoric and action to quell the rise of extremism and division in our society – whether it is Islamist or rightwing.”, Florence Eshalomi, the local Labour MP for Vauxhall, tweeted: “Disturbing to hear of a racist incident at the North Brixton Islamic cultural centre – it was reported that anti-Islamic slogans had been spray-painted on the building opposite the cultural centre. Anyone with any information pls contact the police via 101 quoting CAD 4725/01JAN.”, The incident comes three days after antisemitic graffiti was sprayed across a synagogue and shops in north London during the Jewish festival of Hanukah., The Star of David, a Jewish holy symbol, and the numbers 911 were spray-painted in red and purple on premises in the Hampstead and Belsize Park area, including South Hampstead synagogue., The numbers may have been intended to refer to an antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews were responsible for the terror attack on 11 September 2001; others fear it is a reference to Kristallnacht, the violent pogrom against Jews on 9 November 1938 in Nazi Germany. anti islamic slogans spray painted near mosque in brixton", "label": 0}, "train-1": {"text": "\nMan held on suspicion of double murder after bodies found in house\n, Police arrested a 39-year-old man at Duffield house where two people were found dead, \nSeth Jacobson, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 13.35 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Jan 2020 18.28 EST\n\n, Police have arrested a man on suspicion of murdering two people at a house in the village of Duffield in Derbyshire., The murder investigation was launched after Derbyshire constabulary were called to a house in New Zealand Lane at 4.11am on Wednesday, where they found a man and a woman fatally injured., A 39-year-old man was arrested on the scene on suspicion of two counts of murder and remains in custody.

We never sing Jerusalem and seldom make jam but do have an enjoyable programme. We are able to support the national organisation’s issues along with vital local ones: we’ve raised hundreds of pounds for Welsh Air Ambulance, Blood Bikes Wales and the county’s domestic violence support group., Change is necessary for any organisation, but we have not yet gone as far as one nearby WI, which, although affiliated, does not even call itself a WI, preferring the name “the Custard Queens”!Wilma RushSecretary, Pontrhydfendigaid WI, • It is encouraging to read about the success of the Women’s Institute in recruiting younger women. However, it is worth noting that the WI was set up in 1915 and not during the second world war, as this article suggested. It is also important to acknowledge that its popularity did not wane in the postwar years. Even in the early 1970s, it recorded a membership of more than 440,000 rural women. The WI has a long history of campaigning on a wide range of issues relevant to women’s lives. These include pension rights, cervical cancer screening and equal pay. The current revival of the WI is wonderful, but let us not forget the movement’s dynamic history of activism, for women of all ages. Dr Caitríona BeaumontLondon South Bank University, • May I remind readers about the National Women’s Register, born from the Guardian’s pages almost 60 years ago and still available for women to make friends, learn new things, enjoy stimulating, educational conversation and more. Started to support isolated young mothers, it is now just as necessary to combat loneliness and keep the grey cells working! Sarah AkhtarStoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, • Janet Mansfield (Letters, 31 December) appeals for an end to cliched references to “jam and Jerusalem” when discussing the WI. It’s only a couple of years since I visited a local WI to talk about a charity I represent. The meeting began with an enthusiastic rendering of Jerusalem and I’m pretty sure that homemade jam was one of the raffle prizes on offer.

Elsewhere a woman on a mobility scooter in Staffordshire was killed in a suspected hit and run. , In the incident in Surrey, three people died and a fourth was seriously injured in a collision between a lorry and a car at a junction in the village of Stanwell. BA confirmed the victims were members of cabin crew, saying: “We’re deeply saddened to learn of the death of our colleagues involved in a road traffic collision last night. Our thoughts are with their family and friends.”, Emergency services were called shortly after 11.30pm to a crash involving a Mercedes HGV and a Toyota Yaris. The HGV left the road and ended up in Longford River. Two men aged 25 and 23 and a woman aged 20 who were in the Yaris died at the scene. Another 25-year-old woman in the Yaris, who also worked as cabin crew for BA, is in hospital in a serious condition., The site is close to Heathrow airport. It is believed that all four cabin crew were friends and two of them had finished work at about 6pm, while the others were on a day off and not scheduled to be on duty., The BA pilot Jai Dillon tweeted: “Thoughts are with the friends and family of the three crew who were tragically taken from us last night while driving home from work to be with their loved ones for new year.”, A crowdfunder set up on Wednesday to raise money for the families of the crew members involved had reached more than £32,000 within six hours of being set up, with more than 2,000 people donating to it. , Police are appealing for witnesses., The lorry was operated by the air services provider dnata, which offers ground handling, cargo, travel and flight catering services to airlines., A dnata spokesman said: “We can confirm that one of our trucks was involved in a road traffic accident on the evening of 31 December. We are fully assisting relevant authorities with their investigations.”, Police are investigating several other road deaths across the UK. In the Fallowfield area of Manchester, a 59-year-old man died and five others were injured, four seriously, in a crash between a Skoda Octavia and a Mercedes at 3.30am on New Year’s Day., Another driver died in the first minutes of New Year’s Day after his BMW crashed into a tree.

A woman and two teenage males were taken to hospital., A suspect has been arrested in Staffordshire after a 62-year-old woman riding a mobility scooter was killed in a hit-and-run crash on New Year’s Eve. Staffordshire police said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene in Cannock after her scooter was in collision with a car, believed to be a Volkswagen Golf, at about 6.30pm., A 27-year-old man was arrested in the early hours on New Year’s Day on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision., PA Media contributed to this reportthree die in new years eve collision in stanwell surrey", "label": 0}, "train-4": {"text": "\nVisa applications: Home Office refuses to reveal 'high risk' countries\n, Campaigners criticise decision not to reveal data in algorithm that filters UK visa applications, \nHenry McDonald, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 13.07 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Jan 2020 15.15 EST\n\n, Campaign groups have criticised the Home Office after it refused to release details of which countries are deemed a “risk” in an algorithm that filters UK visa applications., Campaigners for immigrants’ rights were sent a fully redacted list of nations in different categories of “risk”, which were entirely blacked out, on a Home Office response to their legal challenge over the artificial intelligence programme., In defence of its use of the AI system a Home Office spokesperson said the programme fully complied with equality legislation., Foxglove, an advocacy group promoting justice in the new technology sector, is supporting the case brought by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) to force the Home Office to explain on what basis the algorithm “streams” visa applicants., Responding to a letter from the JCWI as part of a pre-legal action move, the Home Office admitted that it decides who gets into the UK on the visa system through nationality., But Foxglove said the Home Office refused to publish its list of what the campaign group labelled “the undesirable” nations in its correspondence to them and the JCWI., “The list provided to us is entirely redacted,” said Cori Crider, a director at Foxglove., “Boris Johnson claims he wants ‘people of talent’ coming into Britain, but the Home Office’s secret list of undesirable countries sure makes it look like its visa algorithm is a convenient way of keeping people of colour out.”, Chai Patel, JCWI’s legal policy director, added: “We know from the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration that Home Office enforcement activity is primarily targeted at only a few nationalities that are easy to remove, so it is likely that information about ‘high risk’ nationalities will be biased by definition., “We also know that Home Office databases are full of errors, and decisions are hugely flawed with 52% of appeals against Home Office decision-making being ruled incorrect. Algorithms, and streaming tools are only ever as good as the data that goes into them: if discriminatory data and decisions go in, then that is what you will get out.”, But the Home Office defended the use of the AI tool, stressing that the final decision on entry to the UK was made by immigration officers., A Home Office spokesperson said: “As the public would expect, we have always used processes that enable UK Visas and Immigration to allocate its high volume of cases in an efficient way., “The streaming tool, first developed in 2015, attributes a risk rating to an application based on a number of criteria, including nationality, and this rating is used to allocate work to caseworkers, not decide the application. Every application is decided by an entry clearance officer., “The tool complies fully with the relevant legislation under the Equality Act 2010.”, The Home Office spokesperson added that UK Visas and Immigration received more than 3.3 million visa applications in the year ending June 2019, of which just under 2.9 million were granted., “The service standard for processing a visit visa is 15 working days. Last year we processed 97% within this target. The UK welcomes genuine visitors. Over 2.4 million visitor visas were granted, for leisure, study or business, an increase of 8% in the past year.”, In its legal action the JCWI is demanding all the technical details that drive the streaming tool be revealed, along with further information such as case-working targets in each of the three categories, and if there have been any complaints about the deployment of the algorithm., The campaign group argues that the use of the streaming tool is a more modern version of a visa entry system ruled unlawful by the House of Lords in 2005., It concerned Roma applicants who were said to have been treated with more suspicion and subjected to more intense and intrusive questioning than non-Roma applicants. The Lords concluded that the “stereotyping of Roma as being less likely to be genuine visitors” to the UK was unlawful.visa applications home office refuses to reveal high risk countries", "label": 0}, "train-5": {"text": "\nBody of man found in disused bank in Yorkshire\n, Family devastated after Asghar Badshah, 39, discovered in Batley on Sunday, \nAmy Walker, \n\nWed 1 Jan 2020 06.40 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Jan 2020 19.45 EST\n\n, The family of a man whose body was found in a former bank in Yorkshire have said they have been devastated by his death., Asghar Badshah, 39, who had been missing for a month, was discovered after police forced entry into the building in Batley on Sunday., Two men, aged 27 and 30, and a 41-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.

Let’s resolve to reconnect. To reach out to just one person we don’t know, or from whom we have drifted apart., “Pick one person. Pick up the phone. Send them a text. Meet them for a cup of tea. Make that connection. Let’s begin cementing our unity one brick at a time.”, Welby recorded his message at Dover lifeboat station, saying: “As we wonder how we are going to start healing some of the divisions that we’ve seen over recent years, the sort of people at this lifeboat station are signs of hope.”, More than 70 volunteers keep the lifeboat service operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The seagoing crew ranges in age from 17 to 62 and includes a student, a train driver, a chef and an electrician., “When their pagers go off, day or night, they’re prepared to risk everything to rescue whoever needs their help,” Welby says., “We rightly think of lifeboat crews as heroic, although they may be embarrassed to hear that. Yet every time we reach out and connect with someone, it is an act of heroism. Don’t underestimate it., “It could be someone you know. It could be someone you’ve always wanted to connect with but never have. It could be someone you really disagree with.”, Connecting with others could involve joining a voluntary organisation or a charity, sorting donations at a food bank or joining a lifeboat crew, Welby says., “When we hear someone described as a good Samaritan, we think about that person taking the time to help another. But it’s a story told by Jesus about someone taking the risk of reaching out to another who was very different to them. Yes, the person needed help – but they also needed connection.”, He says Jesus “took the risk of connecting with people who were separated from him”., In a forthright article marking the start of a new decade, Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, said the past decade had been “low and dishonest”., He wrote on Viamedia: “Just as in 1939 (or still earlier, in 1914), the complacent assumptions of a sunny liberalism have been shaken out. The shadows are in focus once again.”, Referring to a “time of untruth”, Bayes wrote: “I do not only mean by this that our political leaders lie to us. They do, but this is not the worst of it. Worse than lying is the shamelessness that sees no sin in lying, that knows there will be no penalty to being caught lying, that pays no penalty, that systematically devalues truth in the pursuit of popular power.”, He went on: “In a time of untruth, Christianity itself can be weaponised and distorted like everything else, made into a tool of national populism.” Populist politicians in the US, Italy and Hungary were attempting to appropriate the Bible and the cross, he said., While urging the truth to be told, Bayes said: “The last thing that the world needs is a harrumphing self-righteousness from Christians who do not see the glass house in which they live.” He said the church was “a fallen and a broken community”., Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, urged people to pray that the new government would “strive both to create opportunities and respond to those most in need in effective and lasting ways” and that businesses and financial institutions would act to strengthen “bonds with and within the societies in which they operate”., He further called for prayers “that each of us – every person in our society – will shun all forms and expressions of hatred against others. The recent antisemitic graffiti in north London bring shame to us all. Such hatred can have no place in our way of life.

All five were jailed for their part in what prosecutors described as “one of the most sickening paedophile rings this country has seen”., The ring was exposed after an investigation spanning five police forces. It was launched when Blanchard’s business partner found images of abuse on his laptop., During the investigation, Det Supt Adrian Pearson of Nottinghamshire police said Allen was a “sinister and evil individual” who had “not shed a tear of remorse”., According to police, Allen was unemployed and living “on the fringes of society” in a run-down house without any furniture. She met Blanchard online in 2008., The Parole Board report said that Allen had been in “unsuitable relationships” at the time, and had developed “inappropriate ways of thinking” due to social isolation and low self-esteem. It also said that she drank excessive amounts of alcohol and had used illegal drugs., Allen has previously been held in an open prison and undertaken voluntary community work, and had been allowed temporary releases from prison. The report stated that she had built “constructive relationships” with officials and had a “good attitude” to work in custody., The move comes after nursery worker George was released from prison in September last year, despite refusing to reveal the scale of her abuse or the identities of her victims. Among other restrictions, she was banned from entering Devon and Cornwall and from owning a device with access to the internet., A spokesperson for the Parole Board confirmed that they had directed the release of Allen after an oral hearing last month., “Parole Board decisions are solely focused on whether a prisoner would represent a significant risk to the public after release,” the spokesperson said. “The panel will have carefully looked at a whole range of evidence, including details of the original evidence and any evidence of behaviour change., “We do that with great care and public safety is our number one priority,” the spokesperson added.female paedophile angela allen to be released next month", "label": 0}, "train-9": {"text": "\nCommuters gather at Bolton station in protest over increased rail fares\n, Campaigners lead national day of action amid months of delays and cancellations, \nJessica Murray, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 14.36 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 16 Apr 2020 07.32 EDT\n\n, Frustrated commuters gathered outside Bolton train station on Thursday evening as part of a national day of action to protest against increased rail fares., The demonstration was organised by campaign group Northern Resist in partnership with the Association of British Commuters and Bring Back British Rail., The groups are calling for a nationwide fare freeze until services improve and are using the protests to unite passengers around the country frustrated by months of delays and cancellations. Other actions took place outside stations in cities including London, Norwich and Burton-on-Trent., “Delays are consistent, but short-forms are the real sin. This is when they don’t lay on enough carriages and it’s standing room only. The trains are absolutely rammed – it’s like match-day trains every day,” said Steve Sutton, part of the Northern Resist group., The campaigners are demanding that Northern, or any new operator that takes over if it loses the franchise, “cancel today’s fare increase to reflect the dire service”., Sutton said trains are often so busy that people faint: “No one should be forced to lose consciousness on their way to work.”, Another protester, Karen Hon, a teacher and local Labour party campaign coordinator, said: “In a lot of the townships, not just Bolton, the industries have gone. People rely on being able to commute to the cities for work.”, She said by using trains, people risk turning up late for work and being sacked, but with buses and cars often delayed on traffic-clogged roads, there are no alternatives. “With our efforts against climate change, we should be encouraging people to use public transport. People aren’t asking for the world – they’re just asking to be able to get to work on time.”, Sammy Ahmed said her journey home to nearby Chorley, which should take 45 minutes, often takes hours. “I just think the way we’re being treated is absolutely awful. We pay over £2,000 a year for our route from Chorley to Manchester, and they take our money up front and then they cancel all our trains.”, She is now refusing to buy a season ticket as she doesn’t want to pay up front for a poor service and is instead choosing to work from home more often., Sutton stressed how much of an impact the service is having on people’s lives. “There can be weeks on end when a parent doesn’t get that bedtime with the kids, weeks where businesses are missing key staff.”, Northern Resist founder Kate Anstee said: “They implement the fare increase in the first week of January, which is when the country is at its poorest – I can’t stress that enough., “We’ve endured nine years of austerity and it’s the week after Christmas. These fare rises are not justified, and if they are justified, they need to come at a different point in the year.”, She welcomed comments by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, that he has started a process that could strip Northern rail of its franchise or see it issued with a short-term contract. However, Anstee also said chronic underinvestment needs to be tackled for customers to see real change., Between 11 October and 8 November last year, less than half of Northern rail trains ran on time and 5.3% of services were cancelled. The operator runs trains across the north of England, including in Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle Upon Tyne., According to the Northern Fail app, there have been 69,726 full and partial cancellations – 34% due to staff shortages and 22% due to train faults - and 47,325 services with reduced carriages on the Northern network since May 2018. , Councillor Judith Blake, leader of Leeds city council and West Yorkshire Combined Authority transport lead, said: “Higher fares are never a good way to start the year, but rail passengers will find those taking effect this month particularly galling given the ongoing delays and cancellations which are severely disrupting journeys across the North of England.”, She urged the government to introduce greater local control of rail networks, and to make publication of the Williams review into passenger rail services an urgent priority., A spokesperson for Northern said: “Northern’s average annual fare increase is 2.48%, which means an average weekly season ticket will rise by £1.07 and the average off-peak return by just 25p. These rises, which are below RPI and below the average national increase, will help fund current and future investment in rail services across the north of England.”, They added that Northern was working to provide customers with new and better trains and stations.commuters gather at bolton station in protest over increased rail fares", "label": 0}, "train-10": {"text": "\nMan arrested after mother stabbed in front of child in Streatham\n, Suspect held over attempted murder after handing himself in at west London police station , \nMolly Blackall, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 13.41 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Jan 2020 15.00 EST\n\n, A man has been arrested after handing himself in to police following the stabbing of a mother in front of her child in Streatham, south London., The 43-year-old, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and suspected possession of offensive weapons.

He arrived in the UK in 2003 with a valid work permit to take up employment in a restaurant., In 2005 he raised the alarm with the police and the Home Office that his employer was exploiting him by withholding the bulk of his wages, forcing him to work 18-hour days, and beating him., The Home Office allowed him to move to a different employer but a catalogue of problems followed, resulting in him being threatened with removal from the UK., Islam has spent more than a decade trying to prove he has the right to remain in Britain. The case has spanned six governments – from Tony Blair’s to Boris Johnson’s – involved 18 court cases and a huge volume of correspondence with the Home Office., On 20 December 2019 a court rejected Islam’s right to remain in the UK, despite finding that the Home Office wrongly served him with a notice curtailing his visa in 2005, wrongly linked other people’s criminal convictions to him, failed to disclose a full copy of his passport to a court in 2010 and destroyed part of his file., While Judge Jackson in the upper tribunal of the immigration chamber identified multiple errors on the part of the Home Office, he said that issues with a work permit application made by another employer on Islam’s behalf in 2008 meant that he did not qualify for leave to remain in the UK., After a battle Islam finally received his file from the Home Office in 2018, following a ruling by the information commissioner that the Home Office must hand it over. He was shocked to find himself wrongly described as a sex offender and with various other offences that he had not committed attributed to him., As well as initially withholding his file in a previous court case, the Home Office did not provide relevant pages of his passport that proved he had entered the country legally. Instead, officials argued he had entered the country illegally., In 2019 Home Office officials issued a full apology to Islam, stating in an email to him that he had been wrongly recorded as a sex offender. The email admits that police national computer checks on Islam’s file pertained to three other people., It states: “After investigating the issue it appears documents relating to three individuals were incorrectly placed on your paper file. A number of processes had not been followed which allowed these errors to occur.”, The document adds: “Although such errors are not common … we recognise that such issues can have significant impacts.”, Islam said: “The Home Office has treated me worse than a dog. I am a victim of a scandal and of race discrimination. I have lost so many years, I’ve lost my health, I’ve lost so much money. I’ll never get this time back but I’m determined to fight on.”, Fizza Qureshi, chief executive of Migrants’ Rights Network, said: “If Saiful had not persevered with his case for nearly 16 years, he would not have known that the Home Office had mixed up his file and wrongly labelled him a criminal. Alongside the Home Office’s errors, they have also failed to praise Saiful’s actions of reporting an exploitative employer. Instead they have chosen to penalise him by pursuing his removal, despite his innocence and courage. We would urge the Home Office to reconsider his case, and offer him leave so he can utilise his skills as a chef, and allow him to rebuild his life.”, A Home Office spokeswoman said: “We are unable to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”bangladesh chef saiful islam faces removal from uk despite home office errors", "label": 0}, "train-12": {"text": "\nFamilies pay tribute to couple found stabbed to death in Derbyshire\n, Man, 39, charged with double murder as victims are named by Derbyshire police, PA Media, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 12.32 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 2 Jan 2020 11.07 EST\n\n, The families of two people who were found stabbed to death in Derbyshire on New Year’s Day have paid tribute to them., Helen Hancock, 39, from Duffield, and Martin Griffiths, 48, from Derby, who were found at a property in Duffield, were formally named by Derbyshire police., A 39-year-old man has been charged with their murders, the force said.

We would like to thank people for allowing us privacy at this most difficult of times.”, Griffiths’s family said: “Martin was a lovely dad, husband, son, brother and uncle, who had a passion for adventure, running and a love of animals., “He enjoyed travelling the world, mountain climbing and spending time with his two children.

These are all excellent aims and how can anyone disagree with them?, “However, in terms of actual translated policy this means a new four-mile strip of urban tarmac on the rural path from Keswick to Threlkeld, large numbers of off-road 4x4s in Little Langdale, the consideration of numerous zip wire across Thirlmere, driverless electric pods and the possibility of a gondola system up to Whinlatter forest centre., “Let us be quite clear that Mr Leafe may wish to introduce changes in the guise of promoting diversity of access, but the practical application of this policy ends up with increased commercial development and all the issues that go along with that,” said Lywood, who is a member of the LDNPA board., In September, a government-commissioned report into the future of Britain’s protected landscapes criticised national parks for not doing enough to make people welcome., And in a recent interview Leafe said the Lake District had become exclusive to one group and needed to adapt to continue to merit public funding. “We need to be able to sell the national park to everybody in Britain, all society, and it’s important that it doesn’t just become exclusive to one single use group,” he said., “The moment we get into that position I think national parks start to lose their relevance and therefore the very reason for calling it a national park and spending public money., “We are deficient in terms of young people, we are deficient in terms of black and minority ethnic communities, and we are not particularly well-visited by those who are less able in terms of their mobility.”, But Lywood said this was a smokescreen and Leafe had made the comments to distract from the real issues facing the national park., “My worry is that the Lake District national park may move toward becoming the Lake District theme park and that ‘cultural and demographic diversity’ is merely a smokescreen to a green light on a development and adventure gold rush on what is a Unesco world heritage site,” Lywood said., “If this is so, then come out and say it rather than wrap it up in a cloak of ethnicity, age and disability.” , The LDNPA is facing a judicial review in the high court supported by a £30,000 crowdfunding effort over its refusal to ban 4x4s and motorbikes from some fell trails, which campaigners say is ruining the tranquillity of the area., Keswick town council has previously condemned an £8m project to create an accessible multi-user trail with a tarmac surface between Keswick and Threlkeld and passed a vote of no confidence in the LDNPA. The scheme, which will be completed at the end of 2020, was designed to replace a traditional stone-surfaced path that was destroyed by Storm Desmond in 2015., In November England’s largest national park received a highly critical letter from advisers to Unesco, which granted it world heritage status in 2017 after a 20-year campaign., The problem of off-road vehicles is particularly acute in Tilberthwaite valley and the valleys surrounding the villages of Little Langdale and Elterwater, and local people have been lobbying for a ban with the backing of the National Trust and a petition signed by more than 350,000 people., Despite this, in October the LDNPA decided to continue allowing recreational off-road vehicles on dozens of farm tracks on this land – much of it once owned by Beatrix Potter and described by the writer and fell walker Alfred Wainwright as “the loveliest in Lakeland”.call for more diverse lake district sparks row over future", "label": 0}, "train-14": {"text": "\nWelsh Conservative assembly member suspended after arrest\n, Nick Ramsay arrested at his home in Monmouthshire after ‘incident’, \nRajeev Syal and agency, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 10.36 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Jan 2020 15.00 EST\n\n, A Welsh Conservative politician has been suspended from his party after he was arrested by police., It is understood that assembly member Nick Ramsay was arrested on Wednesday evening at his home in Raglan, Usk, Monmouthshire., On Thursday, the Welsh Conservative party confirmed that the shadow finance minister had been suspended – from the Welsh Conservative Group at the National Assembly for Wales and as a Tory party member., A spokesman said: “Nick Ramsay has been suspended from the Welsh Conservative Group in the National Assembly for Wales following an incident which took place yesterday., “The suspension will be reviewed following consideration of the matter by external agencies.

In the autumn I wrote to the necessary parties in this with what’s called a request for proposal., “And that’s simply where you take action. There are a couple of ways that can go. But one is to strip a franchise, one is to have a short-term contract. But yes, exactly as you’ve said, I’m simply not prepared for the service on Northern to carry on as it is and I am taking action.”, Shapps told the Commons transport select committee in October that the first steps had been taken towards taking the Northern rail network back into public hands., He said he had asked the Northern franchisee, the German-owned Arriva, and the government’s operator of last resort to draw up proposals to improve the service., Highlighting that barely one in two Northern trains ran on time, Shapps said: “I consider that it cannot continue delivering in the current delivery method.”, The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “Arriva Rail North should have been stripped of its franchise years ago following its woeful performance and treatment of passengers., “The Tories stood by as the company ran the service into the ground. They failed to hold Arriva to the terms of its contract and yet again passengers and taxpayers will pay the price.”, Rail union RMT, which has long been in dispute with Northern over the role of guards, said Shapps was “big on talk about Northern Rail this morning but short on detail”. The general secretary, Mick Cash, called on Shapps to set out a clear timetable for removing the franchise from Arriva, accusing the transport secretary of trying to distract from continued fare rises., A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: “As the transport secretary said, he has started a process which would either strip Northern of its franchise or to issue a short-term contract to them., “We are taking action to ensure passengers in the north get a better service and we will provide an update in due course.”, There was an average 2.7% rise overall on Thursday, and a 2.8% rise on many season tickets, meaning many commuters face an increase of more than £100 for annual passes., There were protests at a number of stations including King’s Cross in London, where members of the RMT union gathered at the front of the commuter hub, holding signs reading “Cut fares, not staff” and “Privatisation is not progress”., The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said Shapps’ comments were welcome but he was concerned that a possible new contract for Arriva was still on the table. It would be “a reward for failure and completely unacceptable”, he added., He added: “I call on the government to rule it out, put our rail services under public control and work with us towards Greater Manchester taking devolved control.”, Northern has been beset by problems, including the breakdown in industrial relations, and suffered more than most networks after the botched introduction of a new timetable in May 2018., While Network Rail, the owner and operator of Britain’s rail infrastructure, accepted much of the immediate blame for engineering delays and the rescheduling process, Northern has failed to restore punctuality this year., Northern has blamed factors outside its control for the problems. David Brown, the managing director, said in October it had faced “several material and unprecedented challenges” of which the most significant was delayed upgrades to infrastructure and an electrification programme., “These factors – alongside the damage caused by strike action and lower than expected economic growth – have had a significant effect on the revenue expected in our original franchise business plan agreed with government back in 2015,” he said., He added that Arriva and Northern were investing £600m and “remain fully committed to delivering the transformation of the north’s railways”., Such assurances have failed to mollify northern leaders, with the mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotheram, joining Burnham in calling for the franchise to be taken into public ownership., Calls for action have started to extend to the neighbouring franchise, TransPennine Express, which operates faster connections between northern cities. After widespread problems in 2018, it has again seen extraordinarily poor performance in recent weeks, with barely one in two trains running on time since the introduction of a new timetable in December., The Northern Powerhouse Partnership thinktank said TransPennine Express were “equally as bad if not worse” than Northern, and should be treated the same by Shapps., The director, Henri Murison, said: “The same process under way for Northern should be triggered with TransPennine for their unacceptable performance levels. The key issue is what happens next.”, Reported plans to split the current Northern franchise into two businesses was “a knee-jerk response and would likely make problems worse”, he added., Northern would be the second service to be returned into public ownership under the Conservative government, after the collapse of Virgin Trains East Coast, now run as LNER under the Department for Transport’s operator of last resort.northern rail to be stripped of franchise says grant shapps", "label": 0}, "train-16": {"text": "\nIsle of Wight’s rattling, rolling, charming ex-tube trains face end of the line\n, Passengers say change is sad but inevitable as time catches up with UK’s oldest train fleet, \nSteven Morris, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 09.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Jan 2020 12.47 EST\n\n, The train trip from Ryde Pier Head to Shanklin on the Isle of Wight in carriages built 80 years ago for the small tunnels of certain London Underground lines could never be described as a smooth one., Passengers are jolted up and down and, if they are not used to the ride, are thrown around when they rise gingerly from their seats. It is a lurching, rolling experience – but locals and visitors relish it., “It’s great, isn’t it?” said 67-year-old William Bremner, who had caught the train after arriving on the island by ferry and was off to visit his sister. “I like the rhythm of these trains. This trip livens up my life.”, However, the days of the 1938 Class 483 EMUs (electric multiple units) – the oldest train fleet on the UK’s national network – are numbered. From summer 2020, replacement trains will be tested on the eight-and-a-half-mile stretch of line and the buffers will draw into sight for the current stock., Almost all the passengers the Guardian spoke to during a trip on the train expressed sadness at the prospect. Isle of Wight residents Ash and Sammy Butler were travelling with their son Codie, two, all of them Isle of Wight residents. “I love the quirkiness of it,” said Ash. “You can tell the locals from the visitors straight away. The locals know how to sway with the train. Visitors get bounced all over the place. It’s a bit like being on a boat.”, The trains may rattle but they are also lovely. The carriages feature wooden and brass trim. The livery is a deep red., Kathleen Neil and her friend Barbara Snelling manoeuvred on to the train on their mobility scooters, helped by an attentive guard. “It is rickety but that’s the charm of it,” said Neil, who has being riding on the trains for almost 40 years. “We roll on and off all the time to go shopping and meet friends. We love it.”, The history of former tube trains on the Isle of Wight stretches back more than half a century. Space is at a premium on the Island line, and the size and shape of converted tube trains made them suitable., The first of these ran on 20 March 1967 along the island’s newly electrified lines. In 1978 the Guardian reported that the trains gave the Isle of Wight the feel of an Ealing comedy., The current generation of 1938 tube trains began operating in the summer of 1989. There have been hitches, including a runaway train, and for a time the trains were painted in undignified “dinosaur” patterns. Now time has caught up with them and they have become rather more unreliable., Richard C Long, who has written a book, Ryde Rail, on the history of tube trains on the island, said it was sad to see the 1938 trains go but the move was inevitable. “They have a unique quality about them. Many people like their art deco look,” he said., The clattering was not the fault of the trains, he added. “The lurching about is not due to the trains but the track.”, A £26m investment will bring new trains, tracks and infrastructure. The link with London Underground will continue. Vivarail is supplying four EMUs converted from former District Line trains and dating from the late 1970s and early 80s. They are promised to be smoother and will even have wifi., “It will be sad to say goodbye to these carriages,” said Paige Mills, 25. “I’ve ridden on these trains since I was knee high to a grasshopper.” Now she travels on them with her eight-month-old, Louie. “One of the great things about them is that they rock my baby to sleep.

It believes it can recover more than 175,000 troy ounces (5,474kg) of gold and 673,000oz of silver from the site., Richard Gray, Scotgold Resources’ managing director, said it was expected that about 25% of the gold they produce will come from ore they have set aside for use by Scottish jewellers to sell at a premium price., Their gold, processed on site, will carry a Scottish hallmark – a stag’s head in a triangle, stamped by an assay office in Edinburgh, allowing it to be marketed as Scottish gold. Gray said villagers in Tyndrum hope craft jewellers could start up there, making rings, earrings and brooches for tourists heading north towards Glen Coe and Fort William., One luxury jewellery retailer, Hamilton &amp; Inches, has already made and sold some diamond-set products, describing its gold as ethically mined and “exuding warmth and lustre, evoking a golden Scottish sunset, the amber glow of whisky and the radiant beauty of wild landscapes”., Interest in Scottish gold prospecting jumped again in December after a gold-hunter claimed to have found the UK’s largest ever nugget, weighing 121.3g, at an undisclosed river in May. Sniping involves snorkelling and searching face down in the water., Scotgold Resources sold its first Scottish gold in 2016 in the form of 11 commemorative coins, or “rounds”, as a marketing exercise using ore cut when the mine shafts were cut and widened. Most of its gold in future will be sent for smelting and refining in Europe, for sale on the open market., The Cononish mine was first dug in the mid-1980s but the price of gold crashed, forcing it to close before commercial mining could start. As the price soared again in the late 2000s, it was bought by Scotgold Resources in 2007., By then the area was controlled by Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park authority, set up as Scotland’s first in 2002, and came within a special area of conservation, which meant a much tougher set of environmental and planning tests for the mine., Hillwalkers and conservationists objected to the mine reopening. The national park authority gave its approval, but with strict and expensive planning restrictions. Despite a surge of interest from private investors in Australia, Scotgold Resources had problems financing the project, which was seen as too small for serious investors., Now employing 25 people, including locals who had previously worked as shepherds and chefs, the company had forecast it would start full commercial production in February 2020., Gray said they then discovered the peat they need to carefully remove and store while the site was prepared for very heavy ore-grinding machinery, was much deeper than expected; the weather deteriorated too. That delayed their start date to May 2020., They were now on the last stretch. “As someone said the other day, it’s like they’re swimming the Channel and the white cliffs of Dover are in sight,” he said., Scotgold Resources is eyeing up other potentially significant gold deposits elsewhere in the Highlands which lie on the Dalradian rock formation that stretches across Scotland to Northern Ireland where it feeds an opencast gold mine in Co Tyrone, where production has halted for safety reasons., The company has taken up 13 exploration licences from the Crown Estate Scotland covering sites across the southern Highlands from Glen Lyon in Perthshire to the north end of Loch Lomond. Another firm, Erris Resources, has a stake in two other exploration licences near Loch Tay, about 25 miles north-east of Cononish., Gray said Cononish needed to start earning significant income before other sites would be explored. Once that happens, environmental concerns will again come to the fore.gold highlands mine scottish jewellery", "label": 0}, "train-20": {"text": "\nAlleged drink-driver arrested on motorway had no front tyres\n, Police pulled over motorist ‘struggling to drive’ near Bury in early hours of New Year’s Day, \nAmy Walker, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 07.43 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Jan 2020 11.12 EST\n\n, An alleged drink-driver who was arrested on the motorway on New Year’s Day had been driving without front tyres., The motorist was said to be nearly six times the limit when he was detained at the roadside on the M66 in Greater Manchester in the early hours of Wednesday., North West Motorway police posted photos of the car’s bare wheels on Twitter, describing the incident as “unbelievable”.

A place of brilliance, resilience, yet asking now where is it?/ A place you’d travel half the world for, but you hope you’ll never visit.”, Walsh, who goes by the stage name Longfella, had been performing his poetry for 10 years before his powerful ode to Manchester was televised live to the world from Albert Square in the city, 24 hours after the Arena attack., Walsh, who himself overcame serious childhood illness, said: “It was a great honour to write and perform a piece for Royal Manchester children’s hospital and it felt like one of the most important things I’ve ever done., “Over the months I met with families and staff and there were so many moving stories to inspire me as well as the huge sense of pride in the lifesaving work at the hospital.”, The specially commissioned film is to raise money for the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital charity, which supports the families of the more than 276,000 young patients admitted to the hospital every year., Sarah Naismith, the charity’s director, said: “When we looked back over our 10 years it made us appreciate more than ever the vital work and the number of lives the hospital has touched. Tony, with his talent and personal connection, felt like the perfect partner to tell our story to the world.”manchester poet tony walsh tribute childrens hospital every child counts", "label": 0}, "train-23": {"text": "\nBritish identity in 2050: cracks in the union, a streamlined monarchy and 30 more years of Strictly\n, \nBritish identity in 2050: cracks in the union, a streamlined monarchy and 30 more years of Strictly\n, If the UK still exists in 30 years, pop culture, the pursuit of common global objectives and our love of a good joke will still give us a shared identity, \nZoe Williams, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 01.00 EST\n\n, What will British identity mean in 2050? The leap is so immense, and the perils of this particular age – the climate crisis, chiefly, but also the insistent rise of fascism and the turmoil it tends to bring with it – so vast, that it feels audacious and borderline dangerous to even conceive of the nation 30 years hence, let alone predict the notions binding the people within it., However, holding that petrifying thought in my head, I was ambling up the stairs of a primary school, looking at the posters a bunch of kids had been forced by some Goveian idiocy to make about “British values”. This is part of what our collective identity boils down to – the beliefs we share to an exceptional degree. . And given that a faith in our continued existence is a prerequisite for thinking seriously about anything, it is reasonable, and not tempting fate, to ask: what will hold these adults of 2050 together? What hand-me-downs, if any, will they still be wearing?, One of them had made a collage from bits of newspapers, with the words “rule of law”, “democracy”, “riots” and “arrested” cut out and pasted on to a rough-hewn and rather beautiful union flag. Charmingly, he had taken “rule of law” to mean that what we were most proud of was that, when we rioted, we (almost) always got arrested., Overall, the rule of law and the institutions of democracy come up a lot in our collective self-fashioning. When the Guardian raised this question in 2004 – what would 2020 look like? – the think-tanker Tom Bentley wrote of our “grand institutions” all being in retreat: he lumped together membership of trades unions and churches with trust in “the monarchy, the legal system, the church, the civil service or parliament”, and saw it all in terminal decline, on a downward trajectory that had been set since the mid-80s., This was only half-right: leaving the monarchy aside for the moment, certainly trade unions and churches have seen their memberships fall off. Democracy, however, remains core to the British identity: while trust in politicians is low, belief in representative democracy remains high, according to the most recent Social Attitudes Survey. It looks like a paradox, but it isn’t. You can hate your doctor, but still believe in medicine. Parliamentary democracy is fundamental in the way cricket is – we might not be the best at it, but at least we invented it., What we have learned from very recent history, though, is how fragile things are when you don’t write them down. Parliament can be prorogued; the executive can move against the legislature, with the courts as the first, last and only line of defence. The structures that make us British can be upended by our own delinquent elites, under the cover of the more intense Britishness-in-the-moment of a posh accent., The glaring omission in all our predictions from 2004 was that we would end up at war over conflicting identities, because that is what this crisis is: which is more quintessential, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s top hat, or the sovereignty of parliamentarians? The hostile environment or multiculturalism? It is unlikely that it will be resolved without some kind of constitutional overhaul. What was once a pride in the history of these institutions will become, if it survives as such, a pride in their ability to innovate, adapt, grow and codify., Brexit must force a respectful evaluation of these four nations and what they mean to one another, There was also an early-21st-century certainty that civic engagement was on the wane. “Apathy” and “lethargy” were the giant evils, particularly afflicting young people. The most optimistic take was that new groupings would spring up to replace old ones – “online communities, sports clubs, issue-based campaigns or neighbourhood associations” – and you will notice that these are mainly local and apolitical. In fact, the revivification of civic life has most noticeably come from issues that are intensely political and often global – the climate strikes, the women’s marches (this is mirrored on the right, of course; Steve Bannon-style ethno-nationalism is peculiarly multilingual, considering how obsessively bordered it is). The idea of Britishness as an organising principle for civic engagement had a brief, “ironic” reboot with Cool Britannia and hipsters joining the WI, but that masked the more interesting development: the principles of universalism and shared global objectives starting to bolster national identity rather than undermine it. To make that more concrete, I’d expect the union movement to be reinvigorated by transnational actions against global corporate foes. I’m not sure this would work for the Church of England., Brexit will change the way we orientate ourselves towards the EU and the rest of the world – but not, I would posit, in the direction the Conservatives expect. As we saw in 2016, the values case for international cooperation was undeveloped: we could see the trading case, but we hadn’t connected any grander ambitions – to curtail climate change, to strengthen workers against employers, to extend opportunity, particularly in education – with anyone abroad, fighting for the same things. If anything, the way the rest of the world slotted into a belief system related to Britishness – it was as a set of supplicants or victims. We conceived our role in terms of debt jubilees, aid budgets, protective foreign policy (or failures thereof, cf Syria). Broadly speaking, we took confidence in this historically ridiculous notion of ourselves, if not as the world’s policeman, at least as part of its police force. I expect to see that recede after (hopefully only) one hooligan Conservative term, to be replaced by a much more fundamental sense of cooperation and mutuality as part of our core. (This would, of course, be quite a familiar iteration of the British sense of self, from the postwar years.), Perhaps I’ am being myopic, but I cannot see Strictly being any less popular in 30 years’ time than it is today, It is impossible to discuss British identity without considering the possibility that the United Kingdom will no longer exist, now that there is no longer any chance of averting Brexit. There are some die-hard optimists who think the size of the Conservative majority will lead them towards a softer path, now that they don’t have Faragists to placate. Yet it is just as likely that a hard, Singapore-in-the-North-Sea deal is what Johnson now intends, in which case it would be surprising to see the union survive even in the medium term. The unionists no longer have a majority in Northern Ireland, which, coupled with the disregard by Westminster, makes a strong case for reunification. Scotland, meanwhile, is unlikely to slink back into obedience. At any event – the UK staying together or breaking apart, or breaking up and then getting back together again – we will have to see a re-evaluation of what binds its four parts. We have lived our entire lives on the assumption that this union simply was – that much blood was shed in its creation, and here it is, a fait accompli. To be forced to examine that as a marriage in jeopardy, rather than one that is comfortable and unassailable, will be as ugly as any near-divorce in the short term. Yet in the long term, it must force a more nourishing and respectful evaluation of these four nations and what they mean to one another. Either that, or they break apart – and why stop there: why not an independent London and a new king of Wessex?, At the primary school and far beyond, The Great British Bake Off is huge in the shared consciousness. The great decline of the water-cooler moment – TV that we all watched together and talked about the next day – never arrived. Perhaps I’m being myopic, but I cannot see Strictly being any less popular in 30 years than it is today. In this era of ceaseless, intense culture wars – vegans against 4x4-drivers, feminists against Trump fans, etc – one sphere has remained curiously immune: that of popular culture. Nobody ever claims I’m a Celebrity for the left or right (though I did once argue that Bake Off had a leave aesthetic but a remain sensibility)., Every now and then, there will be a sharp moment when one half of the nation is laughing at a joke the other half doesn’t get – Mrs Brown’s Boys, Michael McIntyre – but, speaking generally, it is amazing how solidly we hold together on this axiomatic, existential matter of what’s funny and what isn’t. This is particularly striking when the moment didn’t start out as deliberate comedy at all – Boaty McBoatface, the flurry of reviews left by pretend-diners at the Woking Pizza Express. British exceptionalism is obnoxious, so let’s not say we outdo all other nations in our towering sense of humour, and are marching into a future defined by ever better jokes, but arguably, we are peculiar in how deadly serious we are about it, in how much store we set by the togetherness of mirth, in how much more meaningful that is than the pomp events, the national anthem, Remembrance Day, the explosions of performative patriotism that read as nostalgic even as they are happening., The main threat to the flag-waving arm of British identity is that its raison d’etre, the royal family, probably won’t maintain its current position. I would guess in 30 years they will voluntarily have become more like the Belgian or Spanish royals, largely freed from public duty, photographed only when one of them is surprisingly good looking. They survived a huge amount of falling from pedestals – all that divorcing in the 90s – but the pincer pressures of Prince Andrew’s disgrace, from one direction, and Harry and Meghan’s attempt to force progress from a position defined by stasis, from the other, will do for them as a muster point for national pride., The way we worry about children, the culture they consume, and the cultural behaviours they exhibit, tells us a lot about our anxiety for the future. It’s interesting that, even in 2004, we were fretting about their addiction to phones – there wasn’t even much going on with a phone back then. Now they contain the sum of all human knowledge. I wouldn’t draw a significant warning from it; I bet if Wordsworth had had a smartphone, he would have spent 45% of his time looking at it, and still written poetry. Maybe not as much, but arguably, some of his poems could be shorter. However, the infinite accessibility of knowledge and culture inevitably broadens horizons; I can’t remember us being very interested in Korean pop 30 years ago. The sense that this is driving a global homogeneity, so that ultimately everybody will consume the same sort of everything – food, music, sitcoms, memes, hate figures, unrest – has to be set against that very homogeneity driving a human need to differentiate. The more connected we are, the more intensely we feel our distinct identities. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a subtle intensification of regional identity, coexisting quite naturally with an increasingly global perspective., What really struck me about the predictions we made in 2004 was how dispiriting many of the conversations were: it was all ageing populations, individualism, consumerism, society reduced to the social life, morality reduced to manners, community reduced to the family, families reduced to the nucleus, institutions drained of relevance, ideologies abandoned by an increasingly atomised populace, who might come together over brand loyalty or gardening. Or they might not., There was very high consensus around things that simply weren’t true: that the large questions of politics had been resolved, and our debates in the future would be largely technical; that solidarity was dated, ambition was personal; that people’s dreams would hereafter be very simple: a home, a hearth, a partner, some stuff. This made the most realistic future the one that largely resembled the present, any notion of seismic change centring mainly on technology – faster stuff. Turbulent times also throw off our readings, of course: it’s possible that we overestimate the pace of change in the future, when things change so fast from week to week right now. But a national crisis, whether political, social, environmental, economic, or all of them at once, also underlines the necessity of radical change, and cracks open the possibility that it might be radically for the better.british identity 2050 union monarchy strictly", "label": 0}, "train-24": {"text": "\nOverweight, unfit or shy? The British army still wants you\n, Borderline recruits are getting a second chance to make the grade on four-week boot camp, \nDan Sabbagh, \n\nThu 2 Jan 2020 01.00 EST\n\n, Overweight, unfit and shy recruits are being given a second chance to join the British army via a four-week boot camp as the military seeks new ways to increase troop numbers in its under-strength armed forces., The “soldier development course” – which first ran in September – is designed to help borderline recruits make the grade and is one of a range of measures aimed at stemming a 10% shortfall in fully trained personnel., Speaking as the army unveiled its latest annual recruitment campaign, Col Nick Mackenzie, the head of army recruiting, said: “We are constantly looking at our publications and our policies to ensure we can get more people into the army.”, About 200 would-be recruits have already attended the boot camp, and the plan is to run nine such courses a year, taking in 50 applicants at a time, at a centre in Pirbright, Surrey., Mackenzie said the course would help those with borderline fitness, who were “a bit slow on their run, or they were just a little bit too large”, to meet the minimum standard required., The army is desperately trying to bolster soldier numbers after a long period of decline. There are 73,740 trained personnel, well below the target figure of 82,000., In part, the military’s plan is to look at ways to ease the once strict entry requirements, recognising that young people are not as healthy as they once were as obesity rates have gradually risen across the population., This year’s recruitment campaign is also aimed at teenagers and youngsters suffering from self-doubt and who are bombarded with superficial offers, from fake tans to makeup and from trainers to “Love Island-style” bodies., “Confidence that lasts for a lifetime” can only be obtained from the army, claim the recruitment posters, which feature a range of images including a woman’s face in makeup and a pint of beer as examples of short-term alternative boosts to self-esteem., Army recruiters say their research shows that 54% of 18- to 24-year-olds believe a lack of self-confidence holds them back, and the psychological issue is also one of those addressed on the development course., Mackenzie said: “Some of those people go on the course because they are lacking a bit of confidence. It’s about bringing people on and nurturing them through the process. One part of it is about fitness, some of it is about confidence.”, Other measures introduced to ease recruitment this year include an end to the blanket ban on sufferers of asthma and eczema. “Whereas previously if you had had asthma that’s it, you are out, gone, now we need further medical evidence. We are bit more lenient to letting people come in,” Mackenzie said., Blame for the shortfall has variously been placed on a lack of high-profile military missions for people to sign up for, a squeeze on soldiers’ pay, and problems with the Ministry of Defence’s contract with Capita, the company responsible for signing people up., But last year’s recruitment campaign – aimed at “snowflakes”, “selfie addicts” and “phone zombies” – was deemed to have been a success, partly because it struck a chord among the target group of 16- to 24-year-olds., The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, a former officer with the Scots Guards, said he hoped the 2020 recruitment campaign would build on last year’s: “I know from my own experience the confidence, self-belief and camaraderie a career in the armed forces can offer.”, The MoD said the 2019 campaign resulted in 90,000 applications to join the army between January and the end of November, achieving 90% of the annual recruitment target with three months of the financial year to go., But that has not yet led to an increase in fully trained soldier numbers because of the time it takes to train them.overweight unfit shy british army still wants you", "label": 0}, "train-25": {"text": "Portrait of the Queen and three future kings released, Image is only second formal portrait of the sovereign with Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George, The Queen strikes a familiar pose with handbag firmly looped on forearm in a new portrait alongside three future kings, released to mark the start of the decade., The historic photograph, taken in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace, is only the second formal portrait of the sovereign with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George., The first was in April 2016, on the occasion of the Queen’s 90th birthday, when George, then not quite aged three, had to stand on foam blocks to raise him to the height of the seated adults.

We will no longer be operating in Ayia Napa in any capacity. Any affiliation to Pambos Napa Rocks has been removed from our website and no dates are available to book.”, The holiday booking firm On the Beach said it had suspended advertising for the hotel: “The safety of our customers is of paramount importance. We take the allegations against the hotel in question very seriously. As such, we have suspended online advertising for the hotel for the foreseeable future and are monitoring the investigation of the hotel closely.”, The moves came amid mounting pressure on the Cypriot authorities to grant the teenager clemency when she is sentenced on Tuesday. She faces up to a year in prison and a £1,500 fine after being found guilty of wilfully indulging in public mischief by claiming she was raped by a group of Israeli men., The case against the student hinged on a statement retracting her original accusation, signed after hours of questioning by detectives in a police station that was neither recorded nor attended by a lawyer. She said in court that the police had forced her to change her story, telling the judge she was scared for her life., The Guardian has spoken to two respected witnesses who provided evidence in court for the defence about the unreliability of the retraction statement., Dr Andrea Nini, a forensic linguistics analyst who is listed as an expert by the UK’s National Crime Agency, said it was highly likely the statement was dictated to her by someone who does not speak English as a first language because of its use of irregular phrases, such as “I discovered them recording me doing sexual intercourse”., Cypriot police have denied dictating the statement. The force is also facing fresh questions about its investigation after it emerged officers closed the crime scene barely hours after the incident, with other hotel guests able to check into the room where the alleged attack took place., Noa Shpigel, a correspondent for Haaretz newspaper in Israel, said she had interviewed guests who found a used condom and an empty bottle of duty-free vodka in the room after being allowed to check in less than 24 hours after the alleged attack., Pictures taken by Shpigel show a condom and a gold-coloured vodka bottle allegedly left by the Israeli group accused of the rape on 17 July. The head of the police investigation claimed in court that the condom had been planted by Israeli journalists – a claim described by Shpigel as a “blatant and ridiculous lie”., Lawyers for the woman said on Friday she faces lifelong psychological damage if she is sentenced to immediate custody at Famagusta district court. It is understood Foreign Office officials made contact with the teenager and her family on Thursday after raising serious concerns about the fairness of her trial with the Cypriot authorities., Privately, Cypriot officials have voiced regret about the case, with some intimating that a presidential pardon might be in the offing. However, the government spokesman, Kyriakos Kousios, said earlier this week that the administration had no desire “under any circumstances” to intervene in a pending case before the courts., A presidential pardon would only be possible if the student, who was detained in Nicosia general prison for four weeks in the summer, is sentenced to immediate jail by the judge, Michalis Papathanasiou., Nicoletta Charalambidou, the lawyer heading the teenager’s legal team in Cyprus, said: “Her and her family are very anxious and afraid ahead of the sentence but they have also gained strength and support from the media and network of women now behind them. It’s solidarity that has kept them going.”, It is felt that a pardon by the Cyprus president, Nicos Anastasiades, could help assuage widespread anger over the way the case has been handled., “It is now being openly talked about as a way of saving face,” said Andreas Paraschos, the editor in chief of the island’s Kathimerini newspaper. “This whole affair has been a stain on Cyprus. From the outset so many things were handled wrongly with people who should have been pillars of society falling short of expectation. The negative publicity, alone, has been a huge price to pay.”, Despite the international outcry there seems little sign of lasting damage to the island’s party reputation. The hotel at the centre of the controversy was on Friday advertising a summer party with no minimum age for entry., Several major holiday companies – including easyJet, LastMinute.com and Expedia – are also still advertising the hotel and many have purchased Google ads to appear prominently in search results for the accommodation despite its highly critical online reviews., One of the hotel’s 119 “terrible” ratings on TripAdvisor was by an 18-year-old guest who complained of finding a man on top of her in her bedroom “attempting to rape me” just weeks before the alleged gang rape.

What a start to 2020. Everyone always dreams of winning the lottery at Christmas and talks about how amazing this would be, but Allison and I never believed it would happen to us – and it has., “And then to receive news that Ewan’s latest scans are all clear is just truly amazing. We are so thankful.”, Ewan was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in May last year and underwent chemotherapy., John, 62, a security officer who frequently worked 70-hour weeks, and Allison, 49, who worked in an opticians, have handed in their notice at work., “This is just the most amazing feeling ever,” Allison said., John described how he checked his ticket while having a hot drink at work. “As I continued to check, I realised I had matched all six. I was just in total shock,” he said. “My legs were trembling as I called Camelot to check that what I was seeing was in fact right.”, He told a news conference in North Yorkshire town of Yarm how he called his wife, who was at the dentist., Allison said she saw a missed call on her phone., “I just thought: ‘Oh no, why is he calling me. Something must be wrong, something terrible has happened, has something gone wrong with Ewan’,” she said. “Never did I believe when I called him back he would be telling me we had won the Lotto jackpot., “It is fantastic that this win has not only given us the financial security to buy a lovely new family home, but also time. We can both now afford to stop work and spend time with our family making memories, something we could only have ever dreamed of doing.”, Ewan underwent six rounds of chemotherapy at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, which meant he and Allison spent weeks away from the family home. The couple have two other children and three grandchildren., They were expecting the results of his latest scan to come in the days before Christmas and while they could see his health was improving, they were still afraid there could be bad news before they got the all clear. “Ewan has coped very well, he has been very inspirational,” she said.couple win 2m lottery jackpot as son is given all clear from cancer", "label": 0}, "train-28": {"text": "\nCosta del Sol deaths: church leaders praise strength of widow\n, Pastor describes Olubunmi Diya as ‘remarkable woman’ as her lawyer says case not closed, \nCaroline Davies and \nStephen Burgen in Fuengirola, \n\nFri 3 Jan 2020 09.24 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Jan 2020 11.10 EST\n\n, Church leaders say the widow of a Christian pastor from London who drowned in a pool at a Spanish resort with two of their children on Christmas Eve has astonished them with her grace and dignity in grief, as her lawyer stressed the case was not closed., Olubunmi Diya, who witnessed the incident with their surviving daughter, Favour, 14, has returned to the UK and is being comforted by members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), of which her husband, Gabriel Diya, 52, was a pastor in Charlton, south-east London., The incident has raised questions after Gabriel Diya and the couple’s son, Praise-Emmanuel, 16, drowned trying to save their daughter Comfort, nine, who got into difficulties at the Club La Costa World resort near Fuengirola on the Costa del Sol., The family lawyer, Javier Toro, is pressing for a judge to order a full investigation after a police report published on 27 December concluded the incident was “a tragic accident, in principle caused by the victims’ lack of expertise when swimming”., Diya’s widow has disputed this, saying in a statement that all three could swim. She said she believed something could have been wrong with the concave pool and dragged the three into the middle where it was deeper, making swimming difficult for them., Agu Irukwu, a pastor and chairman of the RCCG board of trustees in the UK, who has spent time with Olubunmi Diya since she and her daughter returned to the UK, said: “Yes, she is grieving, but my wife and I were really amazed at the grace and dignity she is exhibiting at a time like this. We left there thinking we had been in the presence of a remarkable woman., “The strength she is showing, the inner strength, I have never seen anything like it. I have been doing this for 28 or 29 years, and I have never seen anyone handle grief the way she has handled it.”, The couple were sunbathing at the poolside when the incident occurred. There was no lifeguard on duty. Toro has said it is “very, very rare” for three people to die in the same pool, and improbable for a tall man to drown in no more than two metres of water. , More than a week after the incident, the only tangible outward signs of anything amiss at the resort were the constant security patrols around the ochre and salmon pink apartments. A private security guard was stationed beside the pool where the three had died., “It’s not true that the family said they couldn’t swim,” Toro told the Guardian. “The daughter was taking swimming classes at school, as is compulsory, and both ourselves and the police are waiting for a report from the school., “The police have concluded that the accident happened because they couldn’t swim, but if I can show that they could then clearly that conclusion is false. In that case, it’s up to the judge to decide what to do next. All the surviving members of the family want is to find out what really happened.”,  Irukwu said Olubunmi Diya had reiterated to him that she had not told police her husband and children could not swim. Of the questions that had been raised, he added: “Yes, there are concerns. Not just her concerns. They are concerns for anyone who has a bit of knowledge of the things that happened. We have got a good lawyer. He is doing what lawyers do, supervising an investigation and asking more and more questions., “Those questions are necessary, just so we are clear to exactly what happened. There are concerns there might be some culpability on the part of the hotel. We will wait until the reports come out, and then we will determine what the next stage is.”, Club La Costa World said in a written statement that it was aware of Olubunmi Diya’s statement. “The claims made in that statement are directly at odds with the findings of the police report. This makes it clear that their exhaustive investigations have confirmed the pool was working normally and there was no malfunction of any kind,” it said., “CLC can confirm that the pool remains closed out of respect to the victims of this tragedy and that guests have been, and are being, directed to other pools. Our sympathies remain with the family at what we understand must be a stressful and desperately upsetting time for them.”, A JustGiving fundraiser for the family, started by a family friend, had raised more than £13,000 on Friday., Gabriel Diya had been pastor of Open Heavens, a small but growing congregation within the RCCG, for about 13 years. He was ordained in the UK in 2006, having first joined the church in Nigeria, said Irukwu. “He was very likeable, a great personality, very passionate about his calling.

The key issue is what happens next.”, He argued that TransPennine Express, another rail operator in the north, should also face a franchise review for its poor service, and that more power should be awarded to metro mayors in the region, along with Transport for the North, to create an “integrated London-style network”., Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool respectively, have been campaigning for Arriva-owned Northern to be removed from the franchise, and are worried about Shapps’s lack of clarity., Burnham said: “I am concerned that he has left on the table the possibility of Northern having a different form of contract. That would be a reward for failure and completely unacceptable to us.”, Rotheram said: “This is not good enough. Passengers and staff need clarity, so the secretary of state should urgently explain his statement and set out a clear plan as to how he will bring back stability to our railways.”, Campaigners have also pointed out that government underfunding of infrastructure is also to blame for problems, such as insufficient capacity at certain stations and on some areas of track, an issue which Shapps failed to address., Meanwhile, the general secretary of the RMT union, Mick Cash, said Shapps’s comments were “a dead cat being slung on the table to distract from the fare rise scandal”., “If Grant Shapps was serious he would set out a timetable for removing the Northern rail franchise from Arriva and their replacement with the public sector operator.”grant shapps faces calls set out strategy future northern rail", "label": 0}, "train-31": {"text": "\nHuge blaze engulfs scrapyard in Bury, Greater Manchester – video\n, Firefighters worked through the night to tackle a huge blaze in a scrapyard in Bury, Greater Manchester.

The record for the hottest February day was also broken, with Kew Gardens in London recording 21.2C on the 26th., The hottest December day is also likely to have been exceeded when 18.7C was recorded at Achfary in the Scottish Highlands on the 28th, but this is awaiting verification. The Highlands also recorded the highest minimum temperature ever recorded in February – of 13.9C at Achnagart., Eight high temperature records were broken in the last decades, but only one for a low temperature. That was for the lowest maximum temperature for a March day, when Tredegar in Wales never got warmer than -4.7C on 1 March 2018 during the “beast from the east” weather event., “It is notable how many of these extreme records have been set in the most recent decade and how many more of them are reflecting high rather than low-temperature extremes, a consequence of our warming climate,” said Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office’s national climate information centre., The UK’s weather is particularly variable because of the competing influences of the Atlantic Ocean and continental Europe. This means that low temperature records can still be set even as the average temperature rises due to global heating., Globally, 2019 is expected to be the second or third hottest year since 1850. It was the hottest ever in Australia, where huge wildfires are burning, and in Russia. The global average temperature for the last decade is also expected to be the highest recorded, according to the World Meteorological Organization., In the UK, 2019 was the 11th hottest year recorded, but 11 hottest years have occurred since 2002., The UK climate is warming, the Met Office said, but this does not mean every decade will be significantly warmer than the one preceding it. The 2010s were the second hottest and second wettest decade in 100 years, slightly behind the 2000s. This is partly the result of a cold year in 2010, but the Met Office said such years occur much less frequently now than in the past., The coming year is a significant one for action to fight the climate emergency, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and many others urging nations to dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions. The UK government will host a key UN summit in Glasgow in November., A recent comprehensive expert analysis concluded that the world was on a path to climate disaster, with three-quarters of the commitments countries made under the 2015 Paris climate agreement rated as “totally inadequate”. Nations agreed to limit global heating to 2C above pre-industrial levels, or 1.5C if possible. Each country made a voluntary pledge of climate action, but to date these would result in global temperatures rising by a disastrous 3-4C., • This article was amended on 3 January 2020 to re-insert words which had been inadvertently removed during the editing process.climate crisis fuels year of record temperatures in uk says met office", "label": 0}, "train-35": {"text": "Refusing Scottish help a 'grave error' in blood scandal, letter says, Taking supplies from Scotland could have saved hundreds from infection, papers suggest, Hundreds of people with haemophilia in England and Wales could have avoided infection from HIV and hepatitis if officials had accepted help from Scotland, newly released documents suggest., A letter dated January 1990 said Scotland’s blood transfusion service could have supplied the NHS in England and Wales with the blood product factor VIII, but officials rejected the offer repeatedly., Large volumes of factor VIII were imported from the US instead, but it was far more contaminated with the HIV and hepatitis C viruses because US supplies often came from infected prison inmates, sex workers and drug addicts who were paid to give blood but not screened., The death of scores of people with haemophilia and blood transfusion patients and the infection of thousands of others across the UK in the contaminated blood scandal has been described as the worst health disaster to hit the NHS., Scotland’s factor VIII supplies were also contaminated, but to a far lesser degree than those from the US. Sixty people with haemophilia and 18 given transfusions were infected with HIV in Scotland, but the rate of infection in England and Wales was far higher, where 1,243 HIV infection cases ccame to light., A January 1990 letter from the then director of the Scottish Blood Transfusion Service, Prof John Cash, said the service had tested its production facilities in 1980-81 and had found it had “very substantial” spare capacity. Cash said the first offer was made to the NHS in England in the late 1960s, and then reaffirmed after its production tests in 1980-81. Those offers were rejected by civil servants in the Scottish Office in Edinburgh and in the Department of Health and Social Services in London., Cash’s letter, released under freedom of information legislation to a blood contamination campaigner, Jason Evans, whose father died of HIV and hepatitis C contamination, said that was “a grave error of judgment”., Cash wrote: “It was assumed by those of us on the shop floor that this experiment in 1980-81 would expedite arrangements to give England and Wales assistance – but nothing materialised.”, Scotland’s blood transfusion services were entirely separate from those in England and Wales, and there were “serious defects in the operational liaison” between the Scottish department and the DHSS, which oversaw health policy in England, Cash said., Cash said he had attempted to persuade senior officials in both services to cooperate on numerous occasions, but without success. “I sense the ineptitudes of the past – 1970s and 1980s – are about to catch up with us,” he concluded., The Penrose inquiry into Scotland’s blood contamination scandal reported in 2015, and called for the mass screening of blood transfusion recipients. The ongoing English public inquiry, which has taken evidence from affected patients and their families, is expected to hear from experts including Cash this summer., Evans, the founder of the Factor 8 campaign group, said Cash’s letter was a very significant piece of evidence. “We have testimony in black and white here, from a very senior source, which effectively shows hundreds of HIV infections within the haemophilia community could and should have been prevented,” he said., “It fills me with a distinct sense of horror that so many of these people would still be alive if it were not for the total negligence that took place.”, Des Collins, a senior partner with Collins Solicitors, which represents 1,400 victims and families, said self-sufficiency in factor VIII was one of the main issues the English inquiry was investigating., “It is obvious that had the UK produced more of its own factor VIII products, which this evidence makes clear was entirely possible, there would have been far fewer HIV infections,” Collins said., A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “The infected blood tragedy should never have happened.

The documents were revealed to have come from Brittany Kaiser, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, and to be the same ones subpoenaed by Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election., Kaiser, who starred in the Oscar-shortlisted Netflix documentary The Great Hack, decided to go public after last month’s election in Britain. “It’s so abundantly clear our electoral systems are wide open to abuse,” she said. “I’m very fearful about what is going to happen in the US election later this year, and I think one of the few ways of protecting ourselves is to get as much information out there as possible.”, The documents were retrieved from her email accounts and hard drives, and though she handed over some material to parliament in April 2018, she said there were thousands and thousands more pages which showed a “breadth and depth of the work” that went “way beyond what people think they know about ‘the Cambridge Analytica scandal’”., Steele made a rare public intervention to comment on the leaks. He said that while he didn’t know what was in them, the context couldn’t be more important because “on our current trajectory these problems are likely to get worse, not better, and with crucial 2020 elections in America and elsewhere approaching, this is a very scary prospect. Something radical needs to be done about it, and fast.”, He said authorities in the west had failed to punish those practising social and other media manipulation, and “the result will be that while CA may have been exposed and eventually shut down, other, even more sophisticated actors will have been emboldened to interfere in our elections and sow social divisions”., Kaiser said the Facebook data scandal was part of a much bigger global operation that worked with governments, intelligence agencies, commercial companies and political campaigns to manipulate and influence people, and that raised huge national security implications., The unpublished documents contain material that suggests the firm was working for a political party in Ukraine in 2017 even while under investigation as part of Mueller’s inquiry and emails that Kaiser says describe how the firm helped develop a “sophisticated infrastructure of shell companies that were designed to funnel dark money into politics”., “There are emails between these major Trump donors discussing ways of obscuring the source of their donations through a series of different financial vehicles. These documents expose the entire dark money machinery behind US politics.” The same machinery, she says, was deployed in other countries that Cambridge Analytica worked in, including, she claims, Britain., Emma Briant, an academic at Bard College, New York, who specialises in investigating propaganda and has had access to some of the documents for research, said that what had been revealed was “the tip of the iceberg”., “The documents reveal a much clearer idea of what actually happened in the 2016 US presidential election, which has a huge bearing on what will happen in 2020. It’s the same people involved who we know are building on these same techniques,” she said., “There’s evidence of really quite disturbing experiments on American voters, manipulating them with fear-based messaging, targeting the most vulnerable, that seems to be continuing.

So the delivery driver is less valuable than the food they are carrying., “I am totally shocked. This is a very close-knit community, and this is yet another stabbing on the streets of London.” , Inquiries into the incident, which occurred close to the junction with Lennox Road, are continuing, and a police cordon remains in place as forensics team work at the scene. Police have not made any arrests in connection with the death., According to friends at the scene, the victim was a 30-year-old UberEats and Deliveroo delivery moped driver from Algeria. , The group, who are also delivery drivers, said the stabbing occurred after an altercation with a car driver., The delivery drivers condemned the lack of safety and support afforded to them by their employers and police. , One said he felt unsafe “100%” of the time. Another said: “I was attacked here by people with a big machete and now this man has been killed for no reason. The police do nothing. They just come, take a statement and then they go.”, Friends paid tribute to the victim. “He was a good man,” one said. “He doesn’t make any trouble. He works and he goes home and he ends up being killed while he’s working. The country is getting worse.”, Richard Watts, the leader of Islington council, tweeted that he was “horrified to hear about this appalling crime”. , “What an awful start to the new year,” he added., The stabbing came after the Met on Friday announced new measures to tackle violent crime, including a greater presence of uniformed officers in crime hotspots., Last year, the force recorded 149 homicides in the capital before 30 December – up more than 50% in the past five years. The figure marks a 10-year high for London murder cases., The number of stabbings has risen significantly in recent years, with knife crime responsible for 90 of last year’s murder cases, compared with 55 in 2014. met launches first 2020 inquiry after north london stabbing", "label": 0}, "train-43": {"text": "\nGirl, 8, critically ill after her mother is killed in Dorset car crash\n, Car left the road on the A35 Upton Bypass and landed in a ditch, PA Media, \n\nSat 4 Jan 2020 06.06 EST\n\n, An eight-year-old girl is critically ill in hospital after a single vehicle crash that killed her mother., Dorset police said the 28-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene after the silver Vauxhall Astra she was driving left the road on the A35 Upton Bypass in Poole near the Baker’s Arms roundabout.

But you would be wrong, as a fresh generation has been learning this week. And, believe it or not, there is a lot more still to come., The latest episode of The Trial of Christine Keeler, BBC One’s dramatisation of the scandal, airs on Sunday. The central achievement of the series is to place three confident but exploited women – Keeler, Mandy Rice-Davies and John Profumo’s wife, Valerie Hobson – at the heart of the story. The performances of Sophie Cookson, Ellie Bamber and Emilia Fox are the reason why even those of us who lived through the events now have something new to learn., That’s because, as the historian Peter Hennessy says, the Profumo affair remains “a story that has everything”. The fall of Profumo, the war minister, and the inquiries and trials that followed, are a tale both of high politics and of changing social attitudes, all spiced with the cold war paranoia of the times. As Hennessy also says, it remains “a locus classicus classic example not just for political historians but for social and cultural historians too”., This runs the risk of putting it too primly. For most of Britain at the time – and certainly for this 13-year-old and his schoolfriends growing up in 1960s Leeds – the Profumo affair overwhelmingly meant the thrilling opportunity of talking publicly about sex for the first time., In his poem Annus Mirabilis, Philip Larkin wrote that sexual intercourse “began in nineteen sixty-three”. Larkin placed this moment “somewhere between” the lifting of the ban on DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover in November 1960 and the issuing of the Beatles’ first album Please Please Me in March 1963. It was indeed in March 1963 that the Profumo affair first became public., But the start of sexual intercourse can be dated more precisely, to the afternoon of Saturday 8 July 1961. “It did not quite seem it at the time,” says the historian David Kynaston, but the date was “one for the history books”. The Labour politician and diarist Richard Crossman, who would play a role in the Profumo affair, was in Workington (“a wholly working-class, dreary little place” he called it, little knowing what would happen to his party there in 2019). Meanwhile, in the grounds of Cliveden House, a semi-naked Keeler emerged from a swimming pool and met Profumo for the first time, again little knowing where this would lead., Thanks to Kynaston’s researches, I can remember exactly where I was that afternoon myself. I was watching as Freddie Trueman, my total boyhood hero, bowling from the Kirkstall Lane end, destroyed the Australian batting in the third Ashes test at Headingley. Life felt as if it could not get any better. And on the same afternoon perhaps Profumo thought something like that too., It is often said that if the Profumo scandal had simply been about sex it would not have had such a overwhelming impact. Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, thought this at the outset. “I was forced to spend a great deal of today over a silly scrape (women this time, thank God, not boys),” he wrote in his diary for 15 March 1963., What made the “scrape” more serious, Macmillan believed, was that the Soviet naval attache was involved with Keeler too. This was the connection on which Labour, Crossman included, would seize when the issue finally reached parliament a few days later. But what brought Profumo down was that he lied to his party and to the House of Commons., According to Iain Macleod, the leader of the Commons, he asked Profumo: “Look Jack, the basic question is ‘Did you fuck her?’” Profumo gave his word he had not. The Tory high command accepted this. Perhaps, as Macleod’s biographer Robert Shepherd argues, they believed him because so many ministers of that era were “members of the generation of Conservatives who had served as officers in the war”. A chap’s word was enough., Except that it wasn’t. Profumo finally admitted his lie in June and resigned. But this was not the end of the Profumo scandal. Macmillan called in the judge Lord Denning to write a report into the affair; published three months later, it became a bestseller. Rumours abounded – about other ministers, duchesses, film stars, royals – during a heady summer of titillation. Macmillan’s authority was already on the slide (the prime minister would resign in the autumn)., “He was in a terrible state,” Macleod recalled. “Going on about a rumour of there having been eight high court judges involved in some orgy. ‘One’, he said, ‘perhaps two, conceivably. But eight – I just can’t believe it.’ I said if you don’t believe it, why bother with an inquiry? But he replied ‘No. Terrible things are being said. It must be cleared up.”, As Denning delved, Rice-Davies and Keeler became national figures, the latter enduringly so because of “that photograph” in which she posed naked (or possibly not) for Lewis Morley astride an Arne Jacobsen-designed chair. Stephen Ward, the society osteopath who had brought the principals in the Profumo story together, was put on trial and killed himself., Many of us who were alive in 1963 have always remembered where we were when the most famous death of that year, President John F Kennedy’s, took place. I can also remember where I was when Ward died. I was on a camping holiday in western France with my parents when I caught sight of a copy of France-Soir with the headline Le Docteur Ward est Mort. The French had been as obsessed with the story as the British. The president, Charles de Gaulle, who read the British papers avidly throughout, is said to have told an aide: “That’ll teach the English for trying to behave like Frenchmen.”, But we still do not know the full story. The transcripts of Denning’s interviews have never been published. But they still exist. Denning himself once admitted that they contained details of “all sorts of indiscretions”. They are due to become public on 1 January 2048. “I shall have to step up my exercise regime,” says Hennessy, who will be 100 when that day comes., The Profumo scandal remains the gift that keeps on giving, and it will do so for years still to come.profumo scandal trial of christine keeler bbc", "label": 0}, "train-46": {"text": "\nScotland and north of England to be hit by winds of up to 75mph\n, Flood warnings in place across south-west England, with damage to properties expected, \nMolly Blackall, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 15.03 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Jan 2020 16.15 EST\n\n, Winds of up to 75mph (120km/h) are forecast to hit Scotland and the north of England on Tuesday, while south-west England faces risk of flooding., Coastal communities across the north-east of England and the west of Scotland are most at risk from gales, where exposed areas could experience gusts of 70-75mph, according to the Met Office, which issued yellow weather warnings for the two regions., Inland winds are set to reach 50-60mph, with bus and train services likely to be delayed. Loss of power and other services is possible, but cuts are hoped to be short-term., Meanwhile, flood warnings are in place across the south-west of England. Parts of Hampshire, West Sussex and Brighton and Hove are expected to have local groundwater flooding over the coming days, damaging homes, land and property., The Environment Agency has advised that immediate action is required, and urged residents to turn off gas, water and electricity and move their belongings, family and pets out of reach of rising floodwater., A further 26 flood alerts have been issued in areas including Salisbury and Dorset, with the Agency urging residents to be prepared, including readying a bag with medicines and insurance documents., The Met Office has recommended that residents in the north-east of England and west of Scotland drive only if it is strictly necessary and stay indoors as much as possible when the gales hit.

We encourage people to keep checking the forecast, and follow Met Office advice on staying safe in windy conditions.”, Wind speeds are set to fall on Wednesday, but weather will remain unsettled across the UK until Friday, with outbursts of rain expected., The warnings come just two months after floods swept across Yorkshire and the Midlands and parts of England experienced more than a month’s worth of rain in 24 hours., Almost 120 flood alerts were issued in early November, with flooding causing widespread evacuations and leading to the death of the former high sheriff of Derbyshire, Annie Hall, who drowned after being swept away.scotland and north of england to be hit by winds of up to 75mph flooding", "label": 0}, "train-47": {"text": "\nMet police search for van driver after Finsbury Park stabbing\n, Takieddine Boudhane had been riding a delivery motorcycle when he was stabbed to death, PA Media, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 12.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Jan 2020 14.35 EST\n\n, A search is under way for a van driver believed to have been involved in the fatal stabbing of a delivery rider in London., The victim, named by detectives as Takieddine Boudhane, 30, had been riding a motorcycle when he was stabbed to death in Finsbury Park, north London, on Friday evening., Scotland Yard said the Deliveroo and Uber Eats delivery rider was involved in an altercation with the driver of a white van at the junction of Lennox Road and Charteris Road. The vehicle, a white VW Caddy panel-type van, was found in Islington on Sunday and taken to a police compound, where a forensic examination will take place., DCI Neil John appealed for anyone who witnessed the altercation to come forward, including those with mobile phone or dashcam footage. “The driver and person believed responsible for this tragic matter is now the subject of a police manhunt,” he said., “At this time I am unable to release any further information concerning the identity of the driver as this may hinder the ongoing police investigation. The incident itself appears to have been spontaneous and not connected to, or as a result of, anything other than a traffic altercation.”, The fatal stabbing of Boudhane, an Algerian national who had been living in the UK for about three years, sparked the Metropolitan police’s first murder investigation of 2020. Officers were called to reports of a man stabbed in Lennox Road at about 6.50pm on 3 January. London ambulance service also attended the scene, where the victim was pronounced dead at 7.42pm., Although formal identification is yet to take place, Boudhane’s next of kin have been informed., Jeremy Corbyn, whose constituency includes Finsbury Park, visited the scene on Saturday, calling for better protection for delivery drivers. The Labour leader said: “People should not be carrying knives. A human life has been taken., “There are a lot of people working as delivery drivers. They must have better conditions of employment and employers must take more responsibility for their safety too.”, Fellow delivery riders, who had gathered in nearby Stroud Green Road at the weekend, claimed that Boudhane had been a victim of a road rage attack after an altercation., Sourin Aydi said Boudhane was his best friend, telling reporters at the scene on Saturday: “I can’t believe it. I did not sleep last night. He was a wonderful man, funny with a great sense of humour and always laughing.

Lawyers acting on behalf of one of the applicants, Chishamiso Mkundi, 51, applied for a judicial review after his asylum claim was rejected., Granting permission for the review last month, judges said: “It is at least arguable that the respondent the home secretary, Priti Patel failed to consider whether her own actions, in inviting an official from the Zimbabwean embassy to an interview with the Home Office in December 2018, might have brought the applicant to the direct attention to the Zimbabwean authorities.”, Many asylum seekers from Zimbabwe sought refuge in the UK because of their anti-government protests or support for the country’s opposition. Their claims were often rejected on the basis that they were not of sufficiently high profile to come to the attention of the Zimbabwe authorities and thus risk being mistreated on their return., Earlier this year, the high court granted permission for judicial review in a case of another asylum seeker, AG, who challenged the Home Office practice of interviewing asylum seekers whose claims had been rejected, and sharing their information with Zimbabwean government officials. A date for a hearing has been set in February., AG’s lawyer, Rowan Pennington-Benton, said: “Our client is one of many asylum seekers told by the Home Office that it was safe for them to return, as they were not high profile and would slip under the radar upon arrival in Harare., “The Home Office practice of highlighting the presence of these persons, and even allowing them to be interviewed by Zimbabwean officials, seriously and somewhat obviously undermines this., “The practice is dangerous and from a Home Office policy perspective curiously self-defeating, as it provides failed asylum seekers with good grounds to resist removal.”, Mugabe’s government refused to cooperate with British attempts to return people to Zimbabwe, unlike the administration of his successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa., Despite hopes that Mnangagwa’s government would bring political reform, human rights activists have condemned arbitrary arrests, abductions and beatings committed by the police and military., Zimbabweans living in the UK told the Guardian earlier this year that the interviews with officials had left them nervous and unable to sleep. “I’m still so scared. I don’t know how much information about me the Zimbabwean official has got,” one said. “If I have to go back, I will not survive. That’s my honest opinion. My presence there will also endanger my family.”, Mkundi’s lawyer, Alice Muzira, a consultant solicitor at Greystone, called on the government to cease the practice of permitting Zimbabwean government officials to interview potential returnees., “Zimbabwean failed asylum seekers are being required to meet their persecutors in face-to-face re-documentation interviews, thereby exposing them to real risk on return for inability to demonstrate loyalty to a brutal Zimbabwean regime,” she said., Paul Blomfield MP, whose constituency of Sheffield Central is home to a number of Zimbabweans invited to Home Office interviews, said he was pleased that the court had said there was a strong case for saying the practice was illegal., “As the judge recognised, identifying people to the Zimbabwean authorities puts them at higher risk of persecution. Escalating human rights abuses in Zimbabwe are well documented, and the government should consider whether to stop deportations there altogether,” he said., A Home Office spokesperson said: “Re-documentation interviews are a standard part of Home Office process where an interview is required by the receiving country to confirm identity and in order for a travel document to be produced. As legal proceedings are ongoing in this case, we are unable to comment more specifically at this time.”home office faces legal cases over zimbabwean asylum seekers", "label": 0}, "train-49": {"text": "\nFive injured in violent robberies in Northern Quarter in Manchester\n, Police investigating after reports of seven incidents during early hours of Sunday, \nAmy Walker, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 11.54 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Jan 2020 16.05 EST\n\n, Five people have been hospitalised following a spate of violent robberies in Manchester’s Northern Quarter in the early hours of Sunday., Greater Manchester police are investigating after receiving seven separate reports of incidents in the fashionable neighbourhood close to the city centre between 2am and 4am.

His daughter, Gina Campbell, has called for the jet-powered hydroplane to be returned to the scene of his death in the Lake District., But Bill Smith, who restored Bluebird after recovering it in 2001, argued that a contract should be in place before it is returned. , Cambell’s family gifted the wreckage to the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, which oversaw the completion in 2010 of an £800,000 extension to house it. A dispute has arisen over who owns its new parts, with Smith arguing that ownership of the restored vessel should be shared., Last year, Campbell told the BBC she had decided that the vehicle was “not ready to sit in a crusty old museum”. However, on Saturday she told a crowd gathered at the lake to commemorate the anniversary of her father’s death that Bluebird must be returned to the area., “When Bluebird was handed over for restoration, I made a promise to the people of Coniston that the boat would be returned,” she said. “It is absolutely imperative that Bill Smith brings my father’s boat back here to Coniston as soon as possible., Smith, who claims to own all the vehicle’s new parts, posted on Twitter that he would be instructing lawyers to “be standing by” over the disagreement., Speaking to the BBC, he said: “We’ve said the museum should have the boat for nine months of the year and we should be able to take it out for three months. We just need it written down in black and white, then we can crack on and everyone gets what they want.”, Trustees from the Ruskin Museum said in a statement that their obligations were to “preserve, protect and defend one of the most iconic boats in British history for the benefit of the public”., They added: “What Bill Smith and his team of volunteers have achieved is remarkable.

The Care Quality Commission discovered dehydration, serious medication errors, wrongful deprivation of liberty and staffing levels cut below the level stipulated in the contract with Westminster city council., The council outsourced the running of the the home to Sanctuary Care in 2015 as part of an eight-year contract worth £126m to “deliver savings”. Sanctuary made £77m in profit last year but paid some staff £8.54 an hour, £2 less than the London living wage, a voluntary minimum that Westminster pays its own workers., Among the problems discovered were out-of-reach bell-cords that left residents with complex needs unable to call for help, staff failing to answer when residents pressed their wrist alarms, medicines running out and people not being given enough to drink that led to one person being admitted to hospital., “People were placed at undue risk of harm,” the CQC said. “We have identified breaches of regulation in relation to safe care and treatment, safeguarding people from abuse, person centred care, dignity and respect, nutrition and hydration, staffing, acting on complaints and good governance.”, Staff were not properly trained in moving people, end of life care and fire safety, the regulator found. Sixteen people had been assessed as incapable of making decisions for themselves, but the legal process had not been followed and no applications made to deprive people of their liberty. One person’s care plan said they were incapable of communicating their preferences when it was clear they were capable., When inspectors visited they heard one person shouting in distress while being looked after. Bedroom walls were stained, one person had not had a duvet cover for four days and some people had no toothpaste and shower gel., A Metropolitan police spokesman said: “An investigation is under way, working with partner agencies including Westminster city council and the Care Quality Commission. Four women have been interviewed under caution. No arrests have been made. Inquiries continue.”, Adam Hug, the leader of the opposition Labour group in Westminster, said: “The CQC’s findings are a damning assessment of the quality of care being provided by Sanctuary that has let down Westminster residents and put them at risk of harm. The council must take action now to finally end the contract with Sanctuary.”, Heather Acton, Westminster’s cabinet member for public health, said: “It’s completely unacceptable that anyone should be treated with anything but the utmost care and respect at a time of life when they need it most. This was obviously not happening and I’m saddened by the fact that some residents have experienced this poor level of care., “The police are still investigating and we will support them in any way we can. We are carefully considering the next steps with the NHS, but we’re clear that the safety and care of our residents remains our priority.”, Sarah Clarke-Kuehn, the group director for care at Sanctuary Care, said: “We are very sorry that the standard of care at Garside House fell far short of that which we aim to provide. In October 2019, we moved a number of senior managers into the home to oversee an accelerated improvement plan and excellent progress has already been made.”, The CQC inspections took place between 5 and 12 November 2019.police interview four over problems at care home in westminster", "label": 0}, "train-52": {"text": "\nConservationists call for three-mile coastal fishing limit in Scotland\n, Coalition of community, fishing and marine protection groups says fish stocks need to recover, \nSeverin Carrell Scotland editor, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 09.31 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 5 Jan 2020 13.30 EST\n\n, Marine conservation campaigners have called for trawlers to be banned from fishing within three miles of Scotland’s shoreline to help depleted fish stocks and seabeds to recover., The Our Seas coalition, which includes angling bodies, ecotourism firms, scallop divers, coastal communities and salmon conservation boards, believe a ban on inshore fishing would also help prevent illegal scallop dredging and trawling inside existing protected areas., The National Trust for Scotland (NTS), the country’s largest landscape conservation charity, broadly supports the proposal, which would affect 18,000km (11,185 miles) of mainland and island coastline and 13,790 sq km of sea., It has called for ministers to investigate reinstating a ban on trawlers within three nautical miles of shore in a new marine policy paper, the first in its 89-year history. The document codifies the trust’s calls for much stricter policies on fish farms, offshore renewables and mitigating the impacts of climate change on the sea., Stuart Brooks, the trust’s head of conservation and policy, said there should be a restriction of all mechanised fishing within that coastal zone, except for places where there was sufficient evidence inshore fishing was safe., “Fundamentally, it’s about the sustainability of our fisheries, and the people and wildlife that depend on them,” he said. Marine tourism now employed more people than fishing, he added., The coalition, which includes NTS, is launching a campaign later this month urging the Scottish government to impose a three-nautical-mile ban, which was in force in Scottish waters for nearly a century until it was lifted in 1984., The policy would have a significant impact on the boats that primarily trawl for langoustine or dredge for scallops, which replaced the once-bountiful stocks of finfish such as cod and herring that collapsed in inshore waters from overfishing., The campaigners acknowledge narrow sea lochs and many sea channels between the islands would be closed to all trawling, except where trawlers can prove their activities were safe. It would promote lower-impact creel fishing for langoustine, crab and lobster, and hand-dived scallop firms., Open Seas, a conservation charity in the Our Seas coalition, cites an expert study for the Scottish government that said a three-mile closure could produce up to 2,707 extra jobs after 20 years, and at least £1bn of additional income, because it would boost fish stocks and other industries., Scottish ministers have so far resisted pressure to adopt this proposal and have instead offered to ban bottom-trawling or dredging in 11 types of sensitive or rare habitat known as priority marine features., These include beds of flame shell, seagrass and maerl, cold-water coral reefs, Northern sea fan and sponge communities, and native oyster colonies. Scores of sites around Scotland containing these habitats and species would be closed off. Scotland already has an extensive network of marine protected areas, covering 25% of the Celtic seas along the west coast and islands, and 12% of the North Sea., Campaigners argue this strategy of piecemeal designation has failed. They point to incidents where priority features have already been destroyed by illegally dredging or where trawlers have been fishing inside exclusion zones, without being caught or penalised., Alistair Sinclair, of the Scottish Creel Fishermen’s Federation, a partner in the Our Seas coalition, said: “We need to look forward and think of the generations coming after us. We have to secure a future for the young folk and families in rural communities along our coastline.”, Elaine Whyte, executive secretary of the Clyde Fishermen’s Association, one of the UK’s main inshore fisheries organisations, said Our Seas was wrong to attack the current system. “It’s not what the majority of inshore fishermen want,” she said., She said there was a Scotland-wide network of inshore fisheries groups that balanced local fishing and community interests, using voluntary closures and restrictions on conservation grounds. It was an inclusive system and each group tailored its policies to local needs and conditions., “A little bit of everything is the way to go,” she said.conservationists call for three mile coastal fishing limit in scotland", "label": 0}, "train-53": {"text": "\nRelaunch of Newcastle's City Baths begins 'year of hope' for historic pools\n, City’s Turkish baths, refurbished after a local campaign, first among several set to reopen in UK, \nHelen Pidd North of England editor, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 08.31 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 8 Jan 2020 08.38 EST\n\n, Newcastle’s municipal Turkish baths are to reopen this month in what campaigners have dubbed “a year of hope” for historic swimming pools around the country., The art deco City Baths were mothballed by Newcastle city council in 2013 in a “slash and burn” round of cost-cutting that also saw the closure of Sure Start centres, libraries and museums., Now, after a tireless campaign by locals, the Grade II-listed site will reopen for sweating and pampering once more after a £7.5m restoration, taking its place as one of 11 historic Turkish baths in operation across the UK., The revamp has been carried out by Fusion, a leisure charity that made its name with is renovation of Brockwell Lido in south London in 2007 and then Brighton’s Saltdean Lido 10 years later. As well as restoring the baths, they have revamped one of the swimming pools and installed new fitness studios., They are determined to keep prices within the grasp of ordinary workers, reasoning that this “water palace of the people” should not be the preserve of the rich. “We want to make it affordable to all,” said Anthony Cawley, Fusion’s director of operations., The baths have been enjoyed by generations of Geordies since they opened in 1928, as well as celebrities performing at the neighbouring City Hall. Comedian Victoria Wood was one visitor; regulars suspected that her Turkish bath sketch (“If her bum were a bungalow, she’d never get a mortgage on it”) was based on her experiences among half-naked Tynesiders., A day of mourning marked what many feared would be the baths’ swansong in 2013. It featured a poolside recital by the Wet Poets Society and one last sweat for sauna devotees, including a group of army veterans from the Northumberland village of Cramlington, who had enjoyed a monthly session since being demobbed., “It was so sad. It felt that Newcastle had a slash-and-burn policy to make a political point,” said Cait Read, one of a group of bathers who came together to form the Save Newcastle Turkish Baths campaign., They never gave up hope that their steamy sanctuary would one day reopen, despite several wrong turns by the council, which at one point explored turning the complex into a VIP wine bar or a brewery., “The VIP wine bar was a particular low point,” said Read. She believes the council failed to recognise the historic importance of the baths as an “emblem of civic pride” for bringing together people from all sections of society: “There was a whole mix of people from across the city coming together. You’d have the old soldiers from Cramlington, dinner ladies from the civic centre home to Newcastle city council., “It was somewhere you could go for a couple of hours where you didn’t consume anything. Somewhere not alcohol-oriented where you could go alone or in a group, this relaxing oasis.”, After getting the keys in 2016, Fusion, together with architects Napper, began salvaging and restoring all of the original features of the baths, including the tiles, the leather and mahogany relaxing beds, the curtains and more. “We’ve nearly kept everything. We’ve just cleaned and polished and chipped away, working with the local authority’s conservation officer,” said Cawley., He thinks the baths will now become not just a much loved municipal asset, but also a tourist attraction, as has been the case with Harrogate’s Turkish baths in North Yorkshire. “People are now willing to go further to visit these places. It’s the same with lidos,” he said. “We see it as a destination venue as well as a local building.”, Gill Wright, founder of Historic Pools of Britain, believes 2020 will be a vintage year for public bathing, saying: “2020 marks a step change and year of hope for historic pools around the country. There is a sense of positivity and possibility that is truly inspiring. However, what will unfold wouldn’t be possible without the years of effort and campaigning that has preceded this, which has been very much community-led., “Without the tireless efforts of individual volunteers, these are pools that would have disappeared for ever – pools that not only are important to the communities they serve, but stand as wonderful examples of public architecture at its very best and representations of vital social history.”, GlasgowWork is due to start bringing Govanhill baths back to life, which will see the reopening of the ladies’ pool, the learners’ pool and a Turkish suite in 2021., IpswichFunding is in place for the restoration of Broomhill outdoor pool, a Grade II-listed, 50-metre lido in East Anglia, which closed in 2002., BathThe Cleveland pools, England’s oldest lido, is set to open once again in 2021 after campaigners won a £4.7m grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.

It also concludes HS2 would not benefit the north and the Midlands as ministers have promised., Speaking to Sky News, Berkeley said the directors of HS2 had “fiddled the figures” to overstate the benefits of the project and minimise the costs. He said the project assumes 18 trains will run on the line every hour, four more than is allowed on high-speed lines in other parts of the world. “The revenue assumption is all shot to pieces,” Berkeley said., He said he wrote his report because he disagreed with, and was not given the chance to amend, some conclusions of the draft report overseen by Doug Oakervee, the former HS2 Ltd chair appointed by Boris Johnson to lead the review into “whether and how we should proceed” with the project. Oakervee’s official report has yet to be published., Berkeley’s report says: “HS2 Ltd has designed the scheme for 360-400km/h (223-248mph), higher than any other high-speed line in Europe or Japan, and for 18 trains an hour in each direction, when the company itself admits that no other such high-speed line is able to run more than 12 to 14.”, Berkeley, a former Labour transport spokesman who was named as deputy chair of the Oakervee review by ministers as proof it would be balanced, said the government knew about the ballooning costs up to four years ago., The line was initially expected to cost £50.1bn. Latest estimates by HS2 Ltd – the private company in charge of the project – put the price at £88bn. But Berkeley says independent analysis arrives at a figure of at least £107.92bn., “I believe that parliament has been seriously misled by the failure of HS2 Ltd and by ministers to report objectively and fairly on costs and programme changes,” Berkeley writes in his report., Berkeley says information disclosed to the review panel raises “very serious concerns about the competence of HM Treasury and the Department for Transport (DfT)” in relation to the project, and that of HS2 Ltd., He told Sky: “The costs were clearly known to the Department for Transport, and I believe ministers, three or four years ago.”, In his report, Berkeley says he wrote to Oakervee to detail his concerns about the review. These included “a bias towards accepting HS2’s evidence in preference to those of others, leading to what I considered to be a critical but supportive recommendation for HS2 Ltd to continue. I do not believe that the evidence that the review received supports this view.”, Berkeley said that while economic modelling by HS2 Ltd had arrived at a conclusion that the benefits of the project would be more than twice its costs, his best estimate was of a benefits-to-costs ratio of less than one, and possibly as low as 0.6, making it “poor value for money”., He also said plans to build HS2, compared with improving existing lines, were not good for the environment., Berkeley added: “The real problem is that railways in the regions, in particular the north and the Midlands, are really bad and it is them that need investment for local commuters., “Getting to London is secondary for most people except for MPs and the managing directors of companies. So attracting business to these areas will be done by improving the commuter services dramatically to make them look more like London services, which are on the whole very good.”, Berkeley’s report was welcomed by anti-HS2 campaigners and environmental groups. Penny Gaines, the chair of Stop HS2, said: “It is time for this white elephant of a project to be cancelled as quickly as possible.”, Six environment groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, issued a joint statement expressing alarm at how the Oakervee review had been conducted., It called on the government to “scrap – or at least significantly recast – the HS2 project, particularly given its many damaging environmental impacts and the better alternatives to improve our train network”., Phase one of HS2 is planned to run between London and Birmingham. It was initially scheduled to launch in 2026, but a recent report by HS2 Ltd stated this could be pushed back until 2031., A HS2 Ltd spokesman said: “There have been many individual views expressed about the HS2 project. However, we await the publication of the government’s official review.”, A DfT spokesman said: “The government commissioned the Oakervee review to provide advice on how and whether to proceed with HS2, with an independent panel representing a range of viewpoints. Lord Berkeley‘s report represents his personal view.”hs2 parliament misled about true cost says labour peer", "label": 0}, "train-56": {"text": "\nRebel alliance ready to put a halt to the ‘disneyfication’ of Edinburgh\n, Some residents fear the city’s public spaces are being sacrificed to tourism, \nKevin McKenna, \n\nSun 5 Jan 2020 03.14 EST\n\n, For 800 years or so the castle that keeps watch above Scotland’s capital has borne witness to the bloody rise and fall of kingdoms and nations. Now, the war is one of ideas, with Edinburgh’s eternal soul on the line., On one side is Underbelly, the London events company which claims to have taken Edinburgh’s Hogmanay celebrations to another level. It is backed by a city council which has gleefully watched the numbers rise in those indexes that confer tourism superstardom: unique-users, profits and exposure., Facing them is a rebel alliance of permanent residents and community enterprises who are aghast at the creeping “disneyfication” of one of Europe’s most beautiful cities. Mike Small is co-founder of Citizen, launched last April to bring together local groups seeking to restore Edinburgh as “a place for people rather than profit”., “Tourists have flocked to Edinburgh for centuries, attracted by its natural beauty and its wonderful built heritage,” he told the Observer. “It doesn’t need to put on cheap makeup and fancy new clothes to make itself look good. Each year the Hogmanay celebration and the Christmas market on Princes Street Gardens that accompanies it, together with the ever-growing international festival and fringe, eats up more and more of our public spaces.”, In the wake of claims that permanent residents were made to wear wristbands and seek permits for private visitors to their own homes during the Hogmanay celebrations, more than 1,000 residents have applied to join Citizen. A campaign of “civic sabotage” has already been discussed. Protesters could film roped-off events on smartphones and then beam footage onto buildings in neighbourhoods where residents resent being charged up to £170 to go into their own city centre to see them. Flash crowds well-briefed in Scotland’s public access and right of way laws may also seek admission at entry hotspots in the security cordon., Underbelly and the council claim their winter festivals are raising the profile of Edinburgh and bringing in much-needed tourism revenue. The company said 183,857 people attended the city’s Hogmanay last year, and there were 929,219 registered visitors to the Christmas market – 99% of whom rated it “good” or “very good”. A further 28,000 tickets to Edinburgh’s Christmas were given to young people and community groups. From this the company calculated that the community benefit was more than £1m and that the combined contract for the two events saves the city £1m per year., Edinburgh doesn’t need to put on cheap make-up and fancy new clothes to make itself look good, Underbelly’s Ed Bartlam, who co-directed Edinburgh’s Hogmanay last week, said: “Balance is the key word. You’ve got to find the balance of viewpoints. There’s a view of some people in the city that there’s too many events related to tourism. But there’s a huge majority, I think, that just love these events, love Hogmanay.”, Small questioned how savings to the city were calculated. “It’s disingenuous to talk about savings and huge visitor increases. Edinburgh has been one of Europe’s most popular visitor destinations for decades. Have we reached a point where the main measure of a city’s worth is calculated in increased profits and privatising the heart of the city?, “At this time of year our own citizens who pay for the city’s year-round upkeep want to come together with friends, family and visitors from overseas without paying a private company for the privilege., “What we are seeing here is a process where everything is commoditised and where the need to make bigger profits is more important than the lived experience and culture of the city itself. Nor has there been anything resembling a public consultation about any of this.”, As well as producing Edinburgh’s Christmas and Hogmanay, Underbelly has put on Christmas in Leicester Square, West End Live in Trafalgar Square and Pride in London for Westminster city council. Critics say it may soon become difficult to differentiate one festival from another as their unique identities are lost in endless pop-up stalls, “Bavarian” markets and open-air concerts. , In Glasgow, where the local economy is bracing itself for further cuts in public spending, the suggestion that it too could attempt its own lucrative Hogmanay festival was given short shrift by a council source: “We’d never turn Glasgow into a theme park.”rebel alliance formed to halt disneyfication of edinburgh", "label": 0}, "train-57": {"text": "\nKoko Camden: blaze strikes renowned London music venue\n, London fire brigade sent eight engines and about 60 firefighters to deal with the incident, \nKevin Rawlinson, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 17.19 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 18.15 EST\n\n, Firefighters are attempting to save the prominent north London music venue Koko, as flames were seen billowing out of its roof on Monday evening., The London fire brigade said it was called to the scene in Camden, in north London, shortly before 9pm.

However, it has hosted some of the world’s biggest acts, including Madonna, Ed Sheeran and Prince., The venue was due to reopen in spring 2020 after a “major state-of-the-art” refurbishment, after the purchase of two adjacent buildings., It first opened in 1900 and was listed as a Grade II building in 1972. Historic England describes it as having a “symmetrical facade in Baroque pastiche style”. The organisation also fetes the “elaborate foyer” and the “mixture of baroque and rococo ornament” inside the building., And it notes the plaque of Ellen Terry, the celebrated turn-of-the-century British actress who opened the venue in its original guise. In its early years it was used to show a wide range of productions from Shakespeare to pantomime, and opera to musical comedy, and later became a cinema and a BBC recording studio, according to its listing, before finally becoming a club and gig venue.blaze strikes renowned london music venue koko", "label": 0}, "train-58": {"text": "The purpose of the monarchy and the problem of inequality, I was disappointed to read that Richard Coles is now a born-again monarchist (How Princess Anne made me a monarchist, Journal, 1 January). His somewhat uncritical dismissal of objections to privilege, wealth and prestige being ascribed on the basis of accident of birth, would, I suggest, sit uncomfortably with his Christian faith. It is worth noting that the rich young man in Matthew 19 was told to “go sell your belongings and give to the poor”., But it is Coles’ last paragraph that ultimately subverts his own argument: “in an era of growing anxiety, and even more menace, the monarchy here, like other monarchies in other places, could be the best defence against the rise of tyrants”. Really? Surely the recent attempt to prorogue parliament illustrated how our constitutional monarch, far from being a bulwark against tyranny, was an agent of it, albeit unwittingly., What I believe Coles’ all-too-easy conversion has done is show once more, that if the Church of England is to ever be in the vanguard, rather than the guard’s van, it needs to be disestablished – now.Rev David BlackTilston, Cheshire, • I became a monarchist in 1977.

When our town celebrated the bicentenary of the granting of its charter she came to collect “the good Scots penny” the monarch was promised in the charter. She had done her homework about the town, spent the day with us, unveiled two commemorative plaques, opened the refurbished Scout hall and had a buffet lunch at which she spoke to everybody in a very relaxed manner., Having her mother as our monarch enables us to rely on such a steady, non-political figurehead that many countries must envy. Most of the royal family are worth every penny for all that they do – and I would not begrudge the relatively small amount it costs us for their presence, whereas I’d pay plenty to lose a “ruler” like Trump.Helen KeatingGatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire, • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com, • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters, • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

But it’s the pragmatic end.”, Before Brown’s announcement, Transport for London had said the line would open between 2020 and March 2021. Brown told London assembly members on Monday that Crossrail had underestimated the scale of the task remaining, with some stations apparently near completion but then requiring more work to replace systems and wiring., TfL’s business plan, published last month, has admitted the delays would cost the organisation more than £1.3bn in lost revenue. , A further delay will be embarrassing and costly for TfL, after the London Underground boss, Mark Wild, was brought in as chief executive to improve management of the project., The Elizabeth line was set to be opened by the Queen on 9 December 2018, a date that was postponed only three months before the official ceremony., Brown’s guidance to the London assembly’s budget committee on Monday comes less than three weeks after Wild said he still believed spring 2021 was feasible., Wild had initially set out the range of 2020 to March 2021 as a realistic timeframe to complete the troubled project. Challenges including rewriting signalling software would dictate when the line could open, Wild said late last year, with about nine months required for running test trains., The target opening date is expected to be officially revised this month, after a Crossrail board meeting on Thursday., The overall budget for the line has escalated to £18.25bn, from £14.8bn. The Elizabeth line is expected to carry more than 200 million passengers a year across London, linking Heathrow and Reading in the west and Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east, via the West End and Canary Wharf., A TfL spokesperson said: “The Crossrail team continues to make progress completing the railway and is moving forward with the complex testing of the signalling and train systems so that the railway can be handed over safely and reliably for passenger service. As Crossrail Ltd previously announced, the Elizabeth line will open as soon as practically possible in 2021., “As part of our annual business planning process, we have made some prudent assumptions including that the central section of the railway could open in autumn 2021, but continue to support Crossrail Ltd in delivering the railway as soon as possible.”crossrail line delayed autumn 2021", "label": 0}, "train-61": {"text": "\nOff heir! Why it’s time to ban royal weddings from TV\n, The BBC and ITV have both declined to televise Princess Beatrice’s nuptials amid the scandal around her father. Finally, the British public are spared this onslaught of boredom, \nZoe Williams, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 11.22 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 12.35 EST\n\n, If you woke up with a surfeit of sympathy today, you might spare a thought for Princess Beatrice and her betrothed, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The BBC has declined the right to televise their wedding – and ITV has turned it down, too, all the more bitter a pill since Princess Eugenie had hers televised in 2018. When you get to that bit of the royal family where primogeniture is about as much bloody use to you as a tiara made of mice, the least you can expect is the same amount of telly as your younger sister. It is most probably related to the disgrace of Prince Andrew, which is not Beatrice’s fault., I should like to cheer up the heiress-to-shame by pointing out that royal weddings should never have been televised in the first place., Many of us sit down willingly in front of these events, despite not being in any way committed to the royal family or, for that matter, the institution of marriage. For Charles and Diana, this was because there was nothing else on; for William and Kate, it was because you could start drinking mid-morning (this made Eugenie’s a complicated affair: she is simply not a significant enough figure that you could toast her with Prosecco at 10am on a Friday without admitting you had a problem. This accounts for the comparatively low viewing figures – 3.9 million – a million of whom would have been watching This Morning anyway. Really, you have to get close to 20 million or go home)., Even drunk, however, you couldn’t miss the fact that very little happens in a wedding. Even when something genuinely interesting does occur – Meghan and Harry’s leftish choice of sermon and leftfield-ish music – it is something to discuss later, rather than a thing to watch. If weddings were at all engaging, we would all go to church. Being creatures of narrative, we have to find fascination in the detail: dirty looks, upstaging, tears, all the usual dramas attendant upon a family affair. Since this is a very buttoned-up family, everything becomes overinterpreted to the nth degree. Attention is forced upon whose bottom looks good, a story that will then run for months, which has a sullying effect on the entire culture., In 2005, my mother had a heart attack in Reykjavík, and so it came to pass that, for the blessing service of Charles and Camilla’s civil ceremony, the Icelandic health service wheeled a TV up to her bed, and we all had to watch it to be polite. All the nurses stopped to watch it because they thought we were so excited. That absurd confection – artifice piled upon artifice, in respect of other people’s fake feelings for a couple of very long standing in late middle age – was as moving and human as any royal wedding TV event I have ever witnessed. So Beatrice should be relieved, I think – although that is easy for a commoner to say.ban royal weddings tv bbc itv declined televise princess beatrice nuptials", "label": 0}, "train-62": {"text": "\nEssex woman who died giving birth ‘had not received enough blood’\n, Inquest into death of Gabriela Pintilie told of communication failures at Basildon hospital, PA Media, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 10.52 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 15.10 EST\n\n, A woman who suffered a massive haemorrhage and died hours after childbirth did not receive all the blood doctors had ordered for transfusion, an inquest has heard., Gabriela Pintilie, 36, lost a total of six litres of blood after giving birth to her daughter via caesarean section at Basildon university hospital in February 2019., She bled to death over several hours after a breakdown in communication meant that doctors conducting emergency surgery after the birth did not realise how much blood and blood clotting products were available., Pintilie, from Grays, Essex, who was born in Romania, had been due to give birth to her second child via C-section on 28 February 2019, but arrived at the maternity unit three days earlier when her waters broke., After a series of delays, doctors decided to attempt an induced vaginal delivery, but when that was not successful she was given a C-section the following evening., The healthy baby was born at 9.34pm on 26 February., Pintilie was rushed into surgery after haemorrhaging and died at 4.41am on 27 February., Dr Malcolm Griffiths, a consultant gynaecologist not affiliated with Basildon hospital and brought in as an expert witness, told Essex coroner’s court in Chelmsford that Pintilie had lost 600ml of blood – a normal amount for a C-section – by 10pm; however, half an hour later she had lost another two litres., Blood and blood clotting products were requested, and Pintilie was given two units of O-negative universal blood and six units of blood matched to her. None of the clotting products were administered., Griffiths said: “Key people in theatre did not know blood products were available. Gabriela did not receive all of the blood and any of the blood products.”, According to a report by the blood transfusion service, referred to by Griffiths, eight units were released but two were returned afterwards. He said: “Appropriate blood products were provided, but due to confusion … they weren’t administered.”, When asked whether this was a breakdown in communication, he said: “Yes”, and later added: “The top and bottom is: more blood was available that wasn’t used.”, Griffiths also said there had been a series of delays in Pintilie’s care before the C-section. He said: “There were delays in instigating the induction because of workload issues in the unit.”, The later decision to abandon the vaginal delivery was also delayed by a “number of hours”, Griffiths told the hearing, as doctors in the maternity unit were dealing with complications in another patient., The maternity unit at Basildon hospital was given a “requires improvement” rating after a Care Quality Commission inspection in July last year., In the same month, a coroner found that the hospital’s “neglect” had contributed to the death of Ennis Pecaku, who died hours after his breech birth in 2018.

All but four of the 48 victims whose cases came to court were raped., The student was proved to have committed 159 offences, including 136 rapes, which he filmed on two mobile phones. Police have yet to identify at least 70 of his victims., The lifting of a two-year media blackout at the end of Sinaga’s fourth trial on Monday meant that he could be identified for the first time and drew expressions of horror from police and victims, as well as calls for a review of controls on so-called “date rape drugs”., Ian Rushton, the north-west deputy chief crown prosecutor, called Sinaga the “most prolific rapist in British legal history”. Meanwhile, Priti Patel, the home secretary, urged the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to examine control on substances like GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid), believed to have been used by Sinaga., Sinaga is already serving 88 concurrent life sentences with a minimum of 20 years before he can be considered for parole after his first two trials, which related to 25 victims and were heard between 2018 and last year. He was sentenced on Monday for trials three and four, where he was convicted of counts relating to a further 23 victims., Sentencing him at Manchester crown court on Monday, Judge Suzanne Goddard QC described Sinaga as a “dangerous, deeply disturbed and perverted individual with no sense of reality”, who should never be released from prison., The judge said she had strongly considered ordering Sinaga to serve a whole life term, meaning he would never be released, which would have been the first such sentence imposed for a crime other than murder., Goddard said it was a “borderline case”, therefore she could only pass a term for a minimum of 30 years, but added: “In my judgment you are a highly dangerous, cunning and deceitful individual who will never be safe to be released, but that is a matter for the Parole Board.”, The defendant, who wore a knitted sweatshirt and black-rimmed glasses, smirked as he entered the dock beside two custody officers but appeared expressionless and bored for much of the sentencing. He yawned and played with his hair as harrowing evidence of the impact on his victims was read to a packed courtroom., Addressing Sinaga, Goddard said he had shown “not one jot of remorse” and told him: “Again, you seem to be actively enjoying the court process even as you stand there waiting to be sentenced.”, She added: “You are an evil serial sexual offender who preyed on young men who came into the city centre wanting nothing more than a good night with their friends., “One of the victims in their victim personal statement described you as a monster. The scale and enormity of your offending establishes that is an accurate description., “Rarely if ever have the courts seen such a campaign of rape covering so many victims over such a prolonged period.”, Sinaga claimed his victims were enjoying acting out his sexual fantasy of playing dead during intercourse, but the defence was described as “ludicrous” and unanimously rejected by the four trial juries at Manchester crown court., Many of the men could be heard on film snoring while he raped them. One man told the court he showed Sinaga a scan of his unborn child before he fell unconscious, dismissing the idea that he would have consented to what Sinaga claimed was “Fifty Shades of Grey-type stuff”., Sinaga, who moved to the UK in 2007 at the age of 24, mostly preyed on undergraduates in their late teens or early 20s. They had typically gone into Manchester city centre “wanting nothing more than a good night out with their friends”, said Goddard., The court heard Sinaga had a tried-and-tested formula for finding his victims outside clubs within a few minutes’ walk of his flat on Princess Street in central Manchester., He would go out after midnight to wait outside clubs, usually Factory or Fifth, and prey on mostly heterosexual young men who had been kicked out by bouncers or lost their friends or partners. Some had no money for a cab home or their phone batteries had run out, while others had been sick., All were in a state of inebriation when they were approached by the slight, smiling man in black-rimmed glasses, who appeared harmless. When he asked the men if they wanted to come back to his flat and sleep on the floor or have a few more drinks, they agreed., The juries were told Sinaga kept men’s belongings as trophies and looked them up on Facebook. He texted a friend to boast about one victim: “He was straight in 2014. 2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha.”, Police believe Sinaga would have carried on had one of his victims not woken up during an attack and called 999 on 2 June 2017., Following Sinaga’s arrest, police discovered films on two iPhones showing him raping scores of apparently sleeping young men., When Greater Manchester police examined Sinaga’s digital devices, they discovered 3.29TB of extremely graphic material – equivalent to 250 DVDs or 300,000 photos – depicting sexual assaults lasting in one case for eight hours., Whenever groggy victims regained consciousness, Sinaga could be seen pushing them back to the floor to continue the assault or snatching away his phone to avoid suspicion. Few had any idea they had been raped until police knocked on their doors several years later., Many months of excruciating analysis identified 195 victims, all of whom were unconscious when Sinaga abused them. Investigators never found the drugs he had used to knock his victims out., But experts told the jury they believed the men must have been drugged, probably with GHB or something with very similar effects. Even at quantities as low as 1ml, GHB can render a person unconscious., Victims described how their careers and personal relationships had suffered as a result of the abuse. Several said they had turned to alcohol and become socially isolated, unable even to tell close relatives or friends about what happened., One teenager described Sinaga as “an evil predator” and “faceless monster”, and said the day he was told by police that he had been raped “changed my life for ever”. He said he began drinking heavily and having panic attacks, and considered self-harm, abandoning a teaching course., Another man, who had a promising career when he was attacked by Sinaga, said he would have killed himself were it not for his mother, one of the only family members or friends he had been able to tell what had happened., “I’m at the point now where I feel life could not get any worse. This has been my worst nightmare become a reality,” he said in a statement read to the court., Jurors had to watch hours of explicit footage recorded by Sinaga, who insisted throughout that all of the men were simply pretending to be asleep as part of what his barrister, Richard Littler QC, described as “a role-play fantasy”. The law states that an individual cannot consent to sex if they are unconscious, so the jury was required to assess only whether the men in the video were asleep.reynhard sinaga jailed life drugging raping men manchester", "label": 0}, "train-65": {"text": "\nCounty lines dealers 'posing as students to sell class A drugs'\n, Drug dealers are enrolling on courses or recruiting from halls of residence, experts warn, \nSarah Marsh, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 08.48 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 14 Jan 2020 05.52 EST\n\n, A major police force is working with a university to prevent county lines drug dealers infiltrating campuses and setting up there to sell cannabis and cocaine., It comes as academics and a charity warn that academic institutions are increasingly being targeted as a possible market for class A drugs across England and Wales., Those involved in the county lines phenomenon – where substances are moved from cities to provincial locations, often using children as mules – are either enrolling on courses or employing young people at academic institutions as dealers and using their halls of residence as a base from which to sell drugs., The name ‘county lines’ refers to the phone numbers, or lines, that criminal gangs which traffic drugs from urban to rural areas use to organise the sale of their wares. Gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool use children to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones to smaller towns and rural areas., The majority of victims groomed into working for gangs are 15- to 17-year-old boys but children as young as 11 have been safeguarded and girls have been targeted., Many victims are recruited over social media, with offenders luring them with images of cash, designer clothing and luxury cars, but vulnerable girls and women are being targeted by men who create the impression of a romantic relationship before subjecting them to sexual exploitation., In 2015, about seven forces reported county lines behaviour. Now, 44 forces, including British Transport Police, have recorded county lines behaviour on their turf. , No one really knows how many young people across the country are being forced to take part. Children without criminal records – known as ‘clean skins’ – are preferred because they are less likely to be known to detectives. The Children’s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines, while the children’s commissioner estimated at least 46,000 children in England were caught up in gangs., The number of individual phone numbers identified by law enforcement officials as being used on established county lines networks is about 2,000 – nearly three times the 720 previously established.Police estimate the phone numbers are linked to about 1,000 branded networks, with a single line capable of making £800,000 profits in a year., The Children's Commissioner estimates at least 46,000 children in England are caught up in gangs., Insp Jon Aspinall of North Wales police said the force was aware of the problem in their area and working closely with Bangor University to safeguard students. “We have a number of county lines running in from Merseyside, one of the highest areas of county lines numbers being released,” he said., “We have found on occasions that if we stop individuals, they do purport to be students. There are a couple of occasions where that has happened and people have subsequently been found to be in possession of large quantities of drugs and cash.”, He said that in other areas, dealers would “infiltrate university and sign up as a student and run a line from that institution”., Aspinall added: “We have become aware of that, as we are a close-knit community and have a good working relationship with the university, so we have an information-sharing agreement that helps us safeguard people.”, He said national sources had said it was a “tactic that can be used”. The force has a police community support officer assigned to the university, Aspinall added: “Anyone who they are concerned about they have got the reassurance that they can contact us and we can lawfully share information to help safeguard students.”, Mohammed Qasim of LSE’s Mannheim centre for criminology said: “Growing numbers of universities are now seeing county lines drug dealers who are posing as students. But the issue is that some universities are reluctant to talk about it as it damages their reputation. From my discussions with people – both academics and people on the ground – this has been established as something that is happening at increasing numbers of universities.”, Late last year a student who ran a county lines drug operation from his hall of residence was jailed for 30 months. Seif Hashim, 20, enrolled in a physiotherapy course at Kent University as cover while he was selling large quantities of cocaine, heroin and cannabis. Hashim used his course in Gillingham, Kent, to hide his activities., Junior Smart, who founded the SOS Gangs Project, run by the St Giles Trust to help young people and ex-offenders, said it was not a new phenomenon. “If you imagine county lines is criminality evolved … a university is a prime space to run a business. Recreational drug use is commonplace at university, as well as colleges. So in some areas like Brighton, the move into university and student accommodations is an obvious one,” he said., “County lines dealers might say to a young person, ‘We will pay for you to go to university’, but want the halls of residence. Or they may recruit someone already at university and say, ‘Here is a way to make money’.”, Smart said he would like to see more universities engaging with the problem and said further work needed to be done., “The hidden truth is that county lines is not just operated around crack cocaine and heroin. There are loads of other recreational aspects to it. Powder cocaine and ‘uppy’ drugs are common,” he said., Dr Qasim said it was an issue in a rising number of universities. He added: “I don’t think the universities are really focusing their energy on this. I think it is not being looked at as closely as it should and of course universities would say they have their reasons for not pursuing this given that they are reputable places trying to attract students from across the word.”, Dr Simon Harding, professor of criminology at the University of West Londonand director of the National Centre for Gang Research, said he was aware there were county lines boys who were using student accommodation or using people enrolled there as runners., “It would be a lucrative little number if you are put up for free in someone’s bedsit and you and this student distribute drugs to relative groups. You could make a hefty sum that way,” he said., Last year, the scale of the national drugs network crisis was laid bare as figures analysed by the Guardian showed the soaring number of cases in which vulnerable children were linked to gangs., In 2017-18, 8,650 assessments by children’s services in England noted young people as being vulnerable, with gangs identified as an issue. This included 1,290 cases from the north-west and 3,130 from London, up from 3,680 in 2014-15., MPs, academics and charities described the findings as shocking, saying the rise of organised criminal groups that use children to traffic drugs from inner-city areas to provincial towns, where they are used to sell drugs, was a key factor in the surge., county lines dealers posing as students to sell class a drugs experts warn", "label": 0}, "train-66": {"text": "\nReynhard Sinaga: the 'Peter Pan' student who raped scores of men\n, Sinaga was seen by friends as a ‘square’ who could never be capable of such crimes, \nHelen Pidd and \nJosh Halliday, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 07.20 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 15.15 EST\n\n, There is no such thing as a typical rapist. But both Reynhard Sinaga’s friends and victims agree there was nothing about his friendly and unthreatening appearance to suggest he was capable of any kind of violence, let alone a two-and-a-half year campaign of rape and degradation., Barely 5ft 7in (170cm) tall, with a soft voice, ready smile and thick-rimmed glasses, he cut an unassuming figure. “He’s just nice, meek and inoffensive,” said one friend from the Gay Village in Manchester. “I can’t imagine him getting a parking ticket or telling off. He’s such a square.”, Born in 1983 to a Catholic family in Jambi in the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Sinaga came to the UK in 2007 on a student visa when he was 24. For the next 10 years, up until his arrest on 2 June 2017, he lived off money wired from Indonesia by his father, a banker. As well as paying tens of thousands of pounds in tuition fees, his father financed Sinaga’s flat in Montana House, a few doors down from Factory nightclub, which became his favourite place to look for men., Sinaga, known as Rey, rarely talked about his family or life back home, where he had two siblings. His mother came to the first pre-trial hearing, but was not present for any of the four trials her son insisted on putting his victims through, with the defence claiming the men he drugged and filmed himself raping were only pretending to be asleep., He never hid his sexuality in Manchester, where he was a regular on Canal Street and in the Gay Village. Giving evidence in the fourth trial, Sinaga told of using gay dating apps including Grindr and Hornet., His friends say they had no knowledge of his crimes. Some had heard him describe “turning” heterosexual men as a sport. He would boast to certain friends of his sexual misadventures, often with the heterosexual men he was later accused of raping., In July 2015, in a WhatsApp exchange read to the jury, he told a friend that his flatmate was moving out. “You can get in lots of straight boys darling,” said his friend. Sinaga responded with a photograph of his latest victim, passed out: “Hahaha. You mean like this one?”, “There’s always a new one,” said his friend, adding: “Fucking hell darling u get a dif straight every week.”, Friends said he was secretive about his bedroom. In January 2015, after raping a 19-year-old man, Sinaga told a WhatsApp group that he had picked up a man the previous night who had argued with his girlfriend in Factory. “SuperRey saves straight boys from their monstrous girlfriend,” he boasted, sending a photograph of the victim. One friend replied: “Finally I can see the inside of Rey’s room, I was always forbidden to go behind the magic door hahaha. “You were always screaming ‘nooo it’s too messy!’ Then we were joking male dead body were piling under the bed haha.”, Sinaga had a few short-term relationships. One female friend recalled a boyfriend who worked at the Ibis hotel opposite his flat on Princess Street. He did not cope well with rejection, she said, recalling how he threatened to drink bleach when a boyfriend broke up with him., Another friend said it was a mystery where Sinaga got his money from – he once had seasonal work in Next and was briefly an exam invigilator, but he could not hold down a job and yet never seemed short of cash. “He was always out, always going on holiday. We wondered where he got his money because he never seemed to work,” they said. “He was always in the Village. He was one of those people who were always out. He would never be with anyone. He would cling to you and just be with you for the rest of the night.”, When word started to spread in the Gay Village that Sinaga had been arrested, many friends thought there must have been a mistake – until they learned Sinaga had filmed his attacks, cataloguing them alongside photos he took of his victims’ ID or bank cards. That he had spiked their drinks was a further shock. Friends from the Village said he was never into drugs when they knew him, in the early 2010s, and had never spoken of chemsex parties or GHB, sticking to alcohol on his many nights out., One close friend, who collaborated with Sinaga on a photography project, said he was “a sweet, happy guy, always smiling and laughing”, liked by all. He attended St Chrysostom’s church, which prides itself on welcoming “all people regardless of ethnicity, age, relationship status, disability or sexual orientation, and regardless of how much or how little faith people have”., Until recently, Sinaga was still pictured on a church blogpost from 2012, when he helped with a children’s Easter project and talked about the children having a “fabulous time”., The church provided a character reference for Sinaga, with the judge, Suzanne Gooddard QC, remarking during the sentencing of the second trial: “It is almost beyond belief that someone who could profess some Christian faith could at the same time have been committing such wicked and evil crimes.”, The other two references came from his mother and sister, based in Indonesia, neither of whom, said the judge, know of “the cold, cunning and calculated rapist that you are”., His barrister struggled to find anything to say in his favour, accepting the “obvious aggravating factors in the case” and the assessment of psychiatrists and prison staff that he was highly dangerous and at great risk of reoffending., Another friend remembered how someone from the church was helping Sinaga try to apply for refugee status “on the grounds he couldn’t be gay in Indonesia”. Whether he ever submitted an asylum claim is unclear, but Sinaga managed to keep extending his stay in the UK by eking out his PhD. “He was trying to avoid returning to Indonesia and one way to avoid that was to stay a student for ever,” said his photography friend., Sinaga studied at Manchester University from August 2007 for an MA in sociology, and then in August 2012 began studying at Leeds University for a PhD in human geography, which he never finished. He submitted his thesis, entitled “Sexuality and everyday transnationalism among South Asian gay and bisexual men in Manchester”, in August 2016, but it failed and he was given time to make corrections., Sinaga flitted between various groups of friends. One woman who knew him well until 2013 said he thought of himself as “a bit of a Peter Pan”. He looked younger than his age and acted it, being “narcissistic and somewhat naive to everything”. He loved taking selfies and lived his life online, posting daily photographs. The final shot was taken on 1 June 2017, the day before he was arrested, using a filter that gave him pink ears and sunglasses.reynhard sinaga peter pan phd student who raped scores of men", "label": 0}, "train-67": {"text": "\nHow serial rapist posed as a good samaritan to lure victims\n, Reynhard Sinaga pretended to help his victims before drugging them and filming himself raping them, \nHelen Pidd North of England editor, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 07.20 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 6 Jan 2020 16.25 EST\n\n, Reynhard Sinaga’s luck ran out shortly before 6am on 2 June 2017. For at least two-and-a-half years, the Indonesian student had honed his tactic of inviting men back to his flat in central Manchester and handing them a spiked drink on arrival., But that morning, the drugs failed. Or perhaps he had become so complacent that he did not use any. Either way, his final victim, an 18-year-old he had met outside Factory nightclub, woke up face down with his jeans and boxer shorts around his knees. He realised Sinaga was sexually assaulting him and pushed his shorter and slighter attacker off, beating him up so badly he thought he might have killed him., The teenager called 999 and an ambulance soon arrived at Montana House, where Sinaga had lived for five years, around the corner from the clubs where he found many of his victims. Sinaga was stretchered out and taken to hospital with a suspected bleed on the brain, while police arrested the teenager on suspicion of grievous bodily harm., Detectives from Greater Manchester police soon realised they had detained the wrong person. They went to Manchester Royal Infirmary to question Sinaga and noticed he was behaving oddly. He was obsessed with being given his phone and repeatedly gave police the wrong password, trying to grab it from an officer when he reluctantly revealed the correct pin. After unlocking the phone, they discovered films showing Sinaga raping a series of apparently sleeping young men., Another iPhone contained more films of more men. Months of analysis identified more than 195 different victims, who were all unconscious while Sinaga abused them. DI Zed Ali, the senior investigating officer, said it was “like trying to put together a million-piece jigsaw without the jigsaw cover”., Investigators did not find any of the drugs Sinaga is believed to have used to knock his victims out. Police waited two days to interview the final complainant, by which time any drugs would have disappeared from his system. But the prosecution insisted the men must have been drugged, probably with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid – commonly known as GHB – or something with very similar effects., Sometimes known as liquid ecstasy, Gina or G, the drug is popular in the gay chemsex scene. It can cause the levels of sedation, unconsciousness and incapacity seen on the videos Sinaga recorded as he abused his victims. Regular users call it “G-ing out”. On one of the clips, a mobile phone could be heard ringing at full volume but the victim did not stir; in many others, the men could be heard snoring loudly while Sinaga repeatedly raped them., Many of Sinaga’s victims remembered him giving them a drink when they went to his flat. Some recalled being promised a “party” or simply somewhere to sleep for the night, but then had a total blackout until the following day. Only one, a 21-year-old man raped four times by Sinaga in the early hours of 21 May 2017, told the jury there was something odd about the drink he was handed., “It looked like water but there was a solution in it, almost like salt. It wasn’t as transparent as water,” the man said, giving evidence via video link. “I think I said to him, ‘What’s this? This isn’t water’, and he said, ‘It’s water, you need to drink water’.”, The heterosexual man said he remembered nothing after that point until he woke up the next day in Sinaga’s flat with what he thought was “the worst hangover ever”. He noticed a used condom underneath a set of drawers – one of the rare times Sinaga is believed to have used protection – and asked him what had happened. “He said he had saved me, that I was passed out on the sidewalk next to Factory a nightclub, and I said ‘OK, thank you for giving me a place to stay’. It was plausible: I was really drunk,” the man said., In a WhatsApp group where he would boast of his sexual conquests, Sinaga once made reference to a “secret poison” he used to make heterosexual men fall in love with him. He sent the message after raping a 21-year-old man he had spotted trying to walk home after losing his bank card and running out of phone battery on a night out. Asked for his “formula” for seducing these men, Sinaga responded with: “Black magic yeah! Rey makes drink potion of gay love haha … Take a sip of my secret poison, I’ll make you fall in love.”, The drugs were so effective that only Sinaga’s final victim knew with any certainty that he had been assaulted. Until police knocked on their doors several years later, some remembered Sinaga only as the “good samaritan” who gave them a place to stay when they lost their friends or bank card, or their phone had run out of battery., They thanked him for looking after them and felt guilty for imposing on him. Some even agreed to be his friend on Facebook. One returned with his girlfriend the following day to prove he had innocently spent the night at Sinaga’s, rather than with another woman., Forty-eight of Sinaga’s victims agreed to give evidence against him at Manchester crown court, which meant the case had to be split into four separate trials, the first beginning in May 2018 and the final one finishing just before Christmas 2019. Some of the victims were shielded from Sinaga by screens or appeared via video link. Others were in open court., A media blackout was imposed, banning any reporting so as not to prejudice the next jury, with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) keeping open the possibility of charging Sinaga with more of the hundreds of rapes and sexual assaults he had filmed., He kept souvenirs to remember his crimes – passports, watches, bank cards and driving licences – and often took screenshots of his victims’ Facebook profiles to create what the prosecutor, Iain Simkin QC, likened to a “Top Trumps” collection., Giving evidence in the first and last of his four trials, Sinaga described himself as an “effeminate gay man” and claimed he was perceived as a “ladyboy” by his “sexually curious” victims. He said each of the 48 men approached him on the street near his flat and propositioned himbefore agreeing to go to his flat to take part in sexual role play that involved them pretending to be asleep while he penetrated them, sometimes for hours. They were lying in court, Sinaga suggested, because “it is not an easy thing to come out as gay”, and “internalised homophobia” remains widespread., Sentencing him after the first trial, the judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, dismissed his defence as “ludicrous … that each of the males had asked you for oral sex or anal sex and had agreed to take part in your sexual fantasy by lying completely still throughout and not speaking or making any sounds, and had agreed to be filmed in the most intimate ways imaginable.”, Because Sinaga persisted with his defence, jurors had to watch the footage. All were later uniquely offered counselling., A number of the victims vomited and still did not wake up while being abused. The films showed Sinaga carefully checking the younger men were unconscious, putting his finger in their belly buttons to see if they would react, before raping them., Sinaga rarely wore a condom, meaning all of the victims had to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, though he tested negative after his arrest., The earliest rape to come to court took place in the early hours of New Year’s Day in 2015. A 22-year-old man who, like the vast majority of Sinaga’s targets, was heterosexual, could remember nothing after going to the Ritz club in Manchester until he woke up on Sinaga’s floor covered in vomit. After the victim left the flat, embarrassed at imposing on a stranger, Sinaga texted a friend to boast that he had had his first sexual intercourse of the year with a man who was not gay. “He was straight in 2014. 2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha. Well, he was straight until we woke up naked,” he wrote., Sinaga would typically leave his flat at about midnight and go looking for men, most often outside Factory, which was almost next door. Sometimes, he walked for a few minutes and loitered outside 5th Avenue, another club popular with students now known as Fifth Manchester. On one occasion, he was filmed on CCTV leaving Montana House and returning within a minute with his next victim., On one weekend in September 2016, Sinaga raped two men in the space of 24 hours, one in the early hours of Saturday and the other on Sunday. The second man, a 19-year-old who had been out with his mother on Canal Street, remembered Sinaga helping him up from the pavement after he had been kicked out of a taxi. He recalled going back to Montana House but then nothing until he woke up naked in Sinaga’s bedroom the next morning. He asked Sinaga why he was not wearing clothes and was told he had been sick, so Sinaga had undressed him. They ended up having a drink together before Sinaga asked if he would have sex. The man refused, saying he had a girlfriend., “Tellingly, you may think, there was never any conversation concerning the eight instances of sexual activity which had already taken place that morning, nor was there any mention of the defendant recording any sexual acts,” Simkin told the jury in the second trial., When word began to spread in Manchester’s Gay Village that Sinaga had been arrested, there was widespread incredulity that the slight, cheerful man they often saw out dancing and giggling could be capable of such acts. In the early 2010s, he was a fixture on Canal Street, out most nights of the week at the Thompson Arms, G-A-Y or the club night Poptastic., He had a large circle of friends, but few were close. “He was very flamboyant, had highlighted hair and was very camp,” said one man who went out regularly with Sinaga until 2013. “He was always out, always going on holiday. We wondered where he got his money because he never seemed to work.” Others thought he was a sex worker, or involved with a well-off man who funded his lifestyle., One of his female friends remembered Sinaga had a couple of boyfriends: one who worked at the Ibis hotel opposite his flat, and another who left him distraught. “He left Rey and Rey threatened to drink bleach. He had an extreme behaviour in response to rejection, if that’s the right term for it,” she said., Sinaga was constantly chatting to men on the gay dating apps Grindr and Hornet, and was very active on Facebook and Instagram. His final Facebook post was the day before his arrest. When the updates stopped, some of his friends wondered where he had gone., In the end, it was Sinaga’s compulsion to document his crimes that caused his downfall. During sentencing after the second trial, Goddard told him: “It is ironic that were it not for the films that you took of your evil crimes, it seems that most of these offences would not have even been discovered, let alone prosecuted.”reynhard sinaga serial rapist posed good samaritan lure men", "label": 0}, "train-68": {"text": "\nTeenager charged with murder after human remains found in London\n, Police say man found at Barnes property on Friday died from chest stab wound, PA Media, \n\nMon 6 Jan 2020 05.50 EST\n\n, A teenager has been charged with murder after human remains were discovered at an address in south-west London., The 17-year-old, from Kensington and Chelsea, in London, was charged on Monday and will appear at Wimbledon magistrates court later the same day., The remains were discovered on Friday after welfare concerns were raised about an occupant at the property in Nowell Road in Barnes, Richmond., Metropolitan police said a postmortem carried out at Kingston mortuary on Sunday revealed the cause of death to be a stab wound to the chest., The remains are yet to be formally identified, but police believe the victim was a 53-year-old man., The force appealed for anyone with information to come forward.teenager charged with after human remains found in london", "label": 0}, "train-69": {"text": "Cave diver found dead in flooded passage in Cumbria, Body of man in his 40s was discovered at Lancaster Hole, part of 53-mile cave network, Police are investigating after a cave diver was found dead in a flooded section of one of England’s largest underground cave networks., The body of a man in his 40s was discovered at Lancaster Hole, near Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria, on Saturday evening., Emergency services were called shortly before 5pm after the man, believed to be from Lancashire, was reported as being late to resurface during a diving trip., More than 40 specialists from the Cave Rescue Organisation and Cave Diving Group were involved in the search.

He recently discovered that one of the men who was convicted alongside him was an undercover police officer who was pretending to be a leftwing campaigner., The spy called himself Michael Scott and adopted a fake identity to infiltrate three leftwing groups, including the Anti-Apartheid Movement, for five years., Scott’s superiors authorised him to use his fake identity in the criminal trial and to be convicted under his alias., Rosenhead’s lawyers have written to the Crown Prosecution Service asking for copies of official documents relating to his conviction, which he plans to lodge an appeal against., The CPS said it believed that there was no reason to overturn his conviction., His case highlights how a significant number of protesters since 1968 could potentially have been unjustly convicted as key evidence gathered by undercover police officers was withheld from their trials., So far, 57 campaigners have established in recent years that they were wrongly convicted or prosecuted after discovering their protests had been infiltrated by undercover officers., An official report commissioned by the government has identified another 83 political campaigners whose convictions could also be in doubt because undercover operations were hidden from their trials., The 2015 report, by Mark Ellison QC, found that a Scotland Yard undercover unit that infiltrated political groups between 1968 and 2008 routinely ignored legal rules about disclosing the involvement of police spies to criminal trials. He reported that the unit at times failed to correct evidence given in court which it knew was wrong., Rosenhead, who studied operational research for 50 years at the London School of Economics, was involved in the campaign against apartheid for many years., In May 1972 he took part in a demonstration against the English rugby team which was about to go on tour in South Africa, at a time when campaigners were pressing for a sports boycott of the apartheid state., He and the other protesters blocked a coach carrying the team as it left a Surrey hotel for the airport. They left two locked vans and a car at the entrance of the hotel., Police arrested Rosenhead and 13 others. What he and the protesters did not know at the time was that Scott, one of those arrested, was an undercover police officer., Scott used his fake identity to infiltrate the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the Young Liberals and the Workers Revolutionary Party between 1971 and 1976., He was a member of the undercover unit, known as the Special Demonstration Squad, whose members spied on more than 1,000 political groups over 40 years. They developed elaborate fake identities and pretended to be political activists in deployments that usually lasted around five years., Scott is one of three undercover officers in the unit who are known to have spied on the Anti-Apartheid Movement in the 1960s and 1970s., A press report from the time recorded that he had told the court that his name was Scott and that he lived in Earls Court, west London. He also said he worked compiling estimates in the construction industry., Scott was convicted of obstructing the highway and a police officer, fined and given a conditional discharge. Rosenhead was fined the equivalent of £130 in today’s money and ordered to pay another £130 in legal costs for obstructing the highway., Last year, a judge-led public inquiry that is examining the undercover infiltration of political movements notified Rosenhead of Scott’s true identity., Rosenhead said: “I think that this unit was out of control. It was violating our human and legal rights.”, A CPS spokesperson said: “We received a request from the defendant’s legal team to review the circumstances of his arrest and conviction after the anti-apartheid protest in Richmond, Surrey, in 1972.

It could have been much worse than it was.”, Putting someone under surveillance is not done lightly, and for good reason. It would require a senior officer in the Metropolitan police to authorise “directed” surveillance in a public place, or possibly the home secretary to sign a warrant to allow more intrusive surveillance of an individual at their home, or their workplace., We now know that Amman was known to the authorities. He had been freed only days ago after serving half of his sentence of more than three years for the possession and distribution of extremist material. The surveillance could indicate that they might have feared an attack was imminent., Neither the police nor MI5 has the resources to put a large number of people under surveillance at any one time. It is massively resource-intensive, potentially requiring teams of officers working to cover 24-hour shifts; which is why investigators prefer to monitor the communications of people they are worried about, until they believe there is a need to escalate., It is far too early to know exactly what happened in this case. And is worth remembering that MI5 says it is conducting hundreds of counter-terrorism investigations simultaneously and has 3,000 “subjects of interest”. The agency speaks of having a larger pool of 20,000 people “who have been subjects of interest in previous terrorism investigations”. The task for the agency – and for the counter-terrorism police with whom they work – is complex and involves high stakes., There is another truth: the more complex a potential terrorist attack, the better the chances are of it being foiled by the police and Britain’s intelligence agencies. The most difficult attacks to predict, and to prevent, involve the “lone wolf”.streatham attacker police surveillance monitored", "label": 0}, "train-74": {"text": "\nStreatham attacker freed from jail days ago after terror conviction\n, Sudesh Amman, who was shot dead by police, was under police surveillance following release , \nVikram Dodd, \nDan Sabbagh and \nRajeev Syal, \n\nSun 2 Feb 2020 16.51 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Sun 2 Feb 2020 16.11 EST\n\n, The man shot dead by police after he stabbed two people in London on Sunday left prison only days ago and had previously been noted by police as having a “fascination with dying in the name of terrorism”, it has emerged., Sudesh Amman, whose attack on Streatham High Road left one person initially in a life-threatening condition, was under active police surveillance at the time of the attack. He had been freed after serving half of his sentence of more than three years for the possession and distribution of extremist material., Jailed aged 18 in December 2018, Amman had been released after serving part of his three year and four month sentence, but was deemed sufficiently high risk that he was under special monitoring by police., Mobile phone footage of the incident showed officers wearing plain clothes arriving on the scene at high speed, firing about five gunshots and killing Amman outside a branch of the chemist Boots. They used pistols that are normally used by surveillance officers., Amid questions over how Amman was able to carry out the attack so soon after his release when he was being monitored so closely, a Whitehall source said: “He was under surveillance, that is what allowed police to do their job so quickly. It could have been much worse than it was., “There had been concerns when he was in prison but there were no powers for any authority to keep him behind bars., The attack is the second terror incident in the British capital in the past three months, coming soon after former terrorist prisoner Usman Khan stabbed and killed two people in the London Bridge terror attack in late November., Like Khan’s attack it will prompt further political debate about sentencing for terrorists. After an emergency meeting in Downing Street with Priti Patel, the home secretary, and senior police officers, Boris Johnson said: “On Monday we will announce further plans for fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences.”, Amman, 20, pledged allegiance to Islamic State in messages to his girlfriend at the time he was jailed, and said that he wanted to carry out terrorist attacks. At the time, he wrote to her: “If you can’t make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack …”, Comments from police officers at the time suggested that there were serious concerns about the level of Amman’s determination to die as a martyr. At the time of his conviction, Acting Commander Alexis Boon, then head of the Metropolitan police counter terrorism command, said he had a “fierce interest in violence and martyrdom”., In remarks reported in 2018 Boon said: “His fascination with dying in the name of terrorism was clear in a notepad we recovered from his home. Amman had scrawled his ‘life goals’ in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to ‘Jannah’ – the afterlife.”, Boon continued: “It’s not clear how Amman became radicalised but it is apparent from his messages that it had been at least a year in development. Whatever the circumstances, this case is a reminder of the need to be vigilant to signs of radicalisation and report it.”, A Whitehall source claimed that the attack was evidence that the prime minister should be able to enact harsher anti-terror laws. “There was nothing that could be done to keep him behind bars under existing laws, hence why he was under surveillance and strict licensing conditions,” the source said., In another echo of Khan’s attack, Amman was wearing a fake suicide vest, described by some eyewitnesses as containing canister-like objects. Police said they were able to establish quickly it was a hoax device after the attacker had been shot., Police and intelligence agencies only have resources to monitor a handful of individuals at one time, indicating that anybody under active surveillance will have been deemed to be a serious threat., Investigators’ inquiries will now focus on Amman’s associations, whether he was a lone actor or was directed by others, and, if they were being monitored, how the attacker managed to launch a stabbing spree in broad daylight. Investigators cautioned that it remained very difficult to establish exactly when a suspect’s intention turned into violent action., Eyewitnesses said they saw police fire several shots at the attacker. Karker Tahir, who worked in a nearby shop, said he saw “two or three police officers undercover with guns” telling the suspect to stop. “Then I saw them shoot him three times,” he added., Nardos Mulugeta, 52, a mechanical engineer who lives in Streatham, said he heard one shot, then a gap before three or four shots were fired. He described seeing three victims in the street including a woman who said she had been “stabbed in the back”., Two people were attacked on the high street, with police describing a man’s injuries as “life threatening” at the time. In total, three people were taken to south London hospitals, the Met later confirmed. One man’s condition is no longer life-threatening after treatment, a Met statement said; one woman with minor injuries has been discharged; and another woman is still being treated for minor injuries that police said were believed to have been caused by glass following the discharge of one of the officers’ firearms., Police cordoned off the scene, closing down what is normally a busy shopping street and thoroughfare, with shoppers held back as paramedics attended. SThe incident happened so quickly that a double-decker bus that was driving past remained abandoned in the road as forensics investigators worked into the night., An immediate investigation into the shooting is also being undertaken by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

It took the Metropolitan police just one hour and 15 minutes after the first emergency calls to declare it a terror-related incident. By then, two people had been stabbed, with one suffering life-threatening injuries, and one man had been shot dead by armed officers who arrived at the scene., Unlike previous attacks on London Bridge and Westminster Bridge, the action did not take place at a London landmark, but a semi-suburban high street. Shocked shoppers were initially unaware they were caught up in a terror incident., Unconfirmed reports are of the suspect entering a shop wielding a knife. It is then suggested he came out and stabbed a woman on a bicycle., He was then seen being chased by up to three others, dressed in civilian clothes, but now believed to have been undercover officers. Panic set in when gun shots were heard. Witnesses spoke of hearing around three., Video footage filmed by onlookers in the immediate aftermath showed a man’s body lying in front of a Boots store. Police carrying machine guns and masked undercover officers were seen approaching the suspect’s body, before rapidly moving away, leading to speculation that the suspect may have been wearing some kind of device, whether real or an imitation., Met police later said it was a hoax device., One student, who lived in Streatham, was crossing the road when he saw the man being chased. He had “a machete and silver canisters on his chest”, said the 19-year-old, who did not want to be named. Those chasing him were in civilian clothes., “The man was then shot. I think I heard three gun shots, but I can’t quite remember,” he said. “After that, I ran into the library to get to safety.” From the library, the student saw ambulances and armed officers swarm on to the street., Nardos Mulugeta, 52, a mechanical engineer from Streatham, said he heard gunshots and also saw one victim lying in the street. “I heard a shot, then there was a 20-second gap. Then there were three or four shots together.”, Mulugeta said he went over to the first victim, a man, on the ground near the White Lion pub where people were already helping him. “Then five minutes later, a woman came over and said she had been stabbed too, in the back. And then people started helping her,” he said. He then saw another man, lying face down, further away., Three victims were taken to south London hospitals, the Met later confirmed. One man’s condition is no longer life-threatening after treatment, a Met statement said; one woman with minor injuries has been discharged; and another woman is still being treated for minor injuries that police said were believed to have been caused by glass following the discharge of a police firearm., From the shop where he was working with a colleague, Karker Tahir saw the suspect “literally running along the pavement and behind him were two or three police officers, undercover, with a gun”. The officers were shouting “stop”, but “he did not stop”., “Then I saw them shoot him three times,” Tahir told Sky News. “He was on the floor.” He looked like he was carrying something, he added. Police then told him and his colleague to leave the shop because it looked like he might have a bomb. He saw the officers checking on the man, then stepping back. “That’s when we ran,” he said. “I am a bit shocked. I have never seen things like that.”, In the chaos that ensued, passersby attended to the wounded as they waited for ambulances to arrive. David Chawner, an author, spoke on social media of his frustration: “I had to stay with someone who’d just been stabbed in Streatham for 30 minutes before a single ambulance arrived.”, Chawner told Sky News he had no idea he was in the midst of a terror attack until he saw “the guns”. He said he liaised with paramedics on the phone for half an hour while the man lay “on the street bleeding out”. Police, too, “shared my frustration” especially as they were less than one mile away from two major London hospitals. It was “just an incredibly frantic situation,” he added., Luke Black, who was meeting a friend, was just about to have lunch when he saw people running and shouting. “We weren’t sure what was happening and thought it was some kids. It’s only when we got to Boots that we saw a body on the floor and police were ushering people away. We were worried and we heard rumours the man had something strapped to his chest. The police were swift to come in and people were told to leave quickly.”, “There was lots of tension in the air after the incident and people were scared. I feel sad now. It’s Sunday and a bustling street with families. It’s a shame as there is a nice community here.”, Local St Leonard’s church rector, Anna Norman-Walker, found her rectory taped off on both sides as police cordoned off the street. Later, she rewrote her Sunday night sermon in light of the day’s events. “Some of us are here tonight quite simply to be together and to say defiantly that this is a community of kindness, tolerance and friendship,” she said. “We are proud not just of our diversity but of the quality of relationships we enjoy with our neighbours that go well beyond that rather loaded word ‘tolerance’.”, Additional reporting: Jedidajah Ottestreatham terror attack first witness accounts", "label": 0}, "train-77": {"text": "\nStreatham attack: police shoot man dead after 'terror related' stabbing – video report\n, A man was shot dead by armed police in Streatham, south London, on Sunday afternoon.

Scotland Yard said a second victim had minor injuries while a third’s condition was described as “not life-threatening”.

There is a fire door on every floor and there was a poster on each one. It was outrageous.”, After the offending posters were removed as forensic evidence by police, residents posted their own posters, saying “Everybody is welcome in Norwich” above a heart symbol., The racist flyer appeared on the doors on Friday morning, the day the UK formally left the EU., Addressing residents, it said the “Queens sic English is the spoken tongue here” and hailed the moment “we finally get our great country back”., It said those unwilling to speak English should leave the UK. The text read: “You won’t have long till our government will implement rules that will put British first. So, best evolve or leave. God Save the Queen, her government and all true patriots.”, Maguire said: “I’m half-Irish. I don’t think it was directed at me because I’ve got an English accent. It was directed at eastern Europeans from the block. I’ve heard people muttering things against them in pubs, ‘over here taking our jobs’, that sort of nonsense. They have been taking the jobs that the British don’t want to do., “When I was rushed into hospital last year, the nurse and doctor who saw me were eastern European and they could not have been better.”, Hugh Stanners, from the Norwich branch of Stand up to Racism, who organised the demonstration, said: “It is a really nasty racist poster, obvious from someone who is far right or fascist, because it talks about ‘infecting our once great island’. It appears to be the far right are gaining confidence, or seeing an opportunity, from us leaving the EU. People are very upset about it. It wouldn’t be right to portray it as a lone nutter. I think they are part of an organisation.”, Adrian Żółkowski-O’dell, the chair of the Norfolk Polish Heritage Group, said the flyer was “appalling and shameful”. He pointed out that up 9,000 Poles were estimated to be living in Norfolk., Żółkowski-O’dell, whose father was a Polish airman who fought in the second world war before moving to Norfolk, said: “Norwich is not known for its racism particularly, but I do know that since the result of the referendum Poles have felt uncomfortable. They were shocked by the result., “We’ve interviewed recent arrivals who have felt there’s been a change in attitude towards them, but nothing tangible until this. This is the worst incident so far.”, Tom Haczewski, a Norwich-based web designer, thought his Polish grandfather would have been “horrified” by the posters., He said: “I know Norwich to be one of the most tolerant and liberal cities in the UK – we’re proud of our heritage and accept everyone that comes here. I know that this poster is a one-off and we would be ashamed to see this become any more frequent in our city.”norwich anti racism protest brexit day poster", "label": 0}, "train-81": {"text": "\nWhat we know so far about the Streatham terror attack\n, A man wearing a fake suicide vest was shot dead by police in south London after multiple stabbings, \nAaron Walawalkar, \n\nSun 2 Feb 2020 12.10 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2020 16.55 EST\n\n, A man was shot dead by armed police in Streatham, south London, on Sunday afternoon., Police described the incident as “terrorist-related” and said that a number of people had been stabbed., At least three people were injured and taken to hospital.

But green opposition is hardening, \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nSun 2 Feb 2020 11.40 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2020 13.20 EST\n\n, When Labour announced HS2 in 2010, the 153-page launch document contained one mention of wildlife. Only “a few” protected wildlife sites would be affected, it said. There would be a line of concrete and steel crossing middle England, but any wild space that was destroyed would be compensated for with new trees, woods and ponds – “no net loss of biodiversity”, in eco-speak., But critics say HS2’s commitment to biodiversity has weakened, at a time when concern is rising over mass extinction and the continuing decline of wildlife in Britain. HS2 now says it will “seek to achieve a no net loss in biodiversity at a route-wide level as far as reasonably practicable” – in other words, an aspiration at best., Since HS2 was first devised, the environment has been placed at the heart of planning decisions, with the principle of “biodiversity net gain”. The national planning policy framework, which governs planning decisions, asks that developments ranging from housing estates to roads deliver measurable improvements for wildlife., The government’s environment bill is expected to enshrine “net gain” in law. But according to the Wildlife Trusts, even HS2’s much more modest “no net loss” is unachievable under current plans., HS2 has undertaken the UK’s largest ever survey of British wildlife to determine what is imperilled and how it could ameliorate its loss., Although formal construction has yet to get under way, “enabling works” have begun. Ancient trees where bats roost in summer have been removed while bats are absent over winter (it is illegal to disturb roosting bats), and miles of hedgerows have been grubbed up so roads and utilities including gas mains and pylons can be diverted., No one is counting exactly how much hedgerow has been destroyed. As well as being a habitat for nesting birds in the spring, many hedges in winter contain eggs of rare butterflies such as the brown hairstreak., HS2 will damage swaths of countryside where wildlife lives, although the project’s proponents point out it represents an efficient land-take, potentially transporting as many people as a 10-lane motorway., The Wildlife Trusts calculate that HS2 presents a significant risk to five internationally protected wildlife sites, 33 sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs, the gold standard of wildlife habitat), 108 ancient woodlands and 693 local wildlife sites covering 9,696 hectares., These calculations include sites within 500 metres of the high-speed line that could experience disruption, such as from the relocation of utilities or noise pollution, but may not be directly affected., HS2’s figures for directly affected sites are lower: it says 14 SSSIs, 62 ancient woodlands and 204 local wildlife sites will be affected., The London-Birmingham stage includes 25 miles of tunnel, 140 bridges and underpasses and 16 “green” bridges for wildlife. New habitat will include specially constructed newt ponds created in advance so wildlife has a place to move to., Opposition to HS2 has hardened since these compensation efforts have taken shape. Thousands of new trees died in Warwickshire after the hot summer of 2018; HS2 said it was more cost-effective to replant than water them., The Wildlife Trusts and HS2’s own ecologists agree that the new line will provide a barrier to the movement of some birds, mammals and insects. Species particularly vulnerable to train strikes include low-flying barn owls and rare bats., There remain unresolved questions about the fate of chalk aquifers in the Chilterns and underground streams supplying drinking water, as well as ponds and wetlands. , The loss of ancient woodland areas, continuously wooded since at least 1600, is particularly controversial. HS2 argues that only small portions of 62 ancient woodlands are affected, and 85% of these will remain., The Woodland Trust’s calculation of 56 lost hectares on the London-Birmingham and Crewe stages amounts to 0.018% of Britain’s remaining 308,000 hectares of ancient woodland. HS2 has a £7m woodlands fund ((less than 0.007% of its projected £106bn total cost) supporting the creation of 116 hectares of new woodland and the restoration of 159 hectares of ancient woodland as compensation., HS2 may only take fragments of woodlands but in cases such as Glyn Davies wood it is removing the best bits, such as ancient boundary trees. Ancient woodland is considered irreplaceable by Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog. It takes at least 100 years for new woods to reach maturity. Many woodland species, such as the marsh tit, require old trees in order to breed successfully., Ancient woodland soils untouched by chemical farming are particularly precious, so HS2 is proposing to dig up and move the soil. The Woodland Trust cites one relevant 10-year study of soil translocation after a new road was built. “It’s nowhere near long enough to prove that it works,” said Luci Ryan, an ecologist at the Woodland Trust. Soil translocation will destroy the “woodwide web”, the subterranean network of mycorrhizal fungi that play a vital, complex and poorly understood role in regulating woodland health., “HS2 say they are only taking a fragment of ancient woodland,” said Ryan. “If I went into the National Gallery and cut off the corner of every painting, I would be accused of gross cultural vandalism.” The Woodland Trust fears HS2 sets a precedent. “If the government says it’s irreplaceable, it’s not a good look when the government also says ‘we’re only taking a little bit’. Other developers are going to say: ‘Why can’t we?’”fears grow over hs2s potential impact on biodiversity", "label": 0}, "train-83": {"text": "\nWill HS2 really help cut the UK’s carbon footprint?\n, \nWill HS2 really help cut the UK’s carbon footprint?\n, The high-speed rail project has become one of the most costly and controversial of the modern era – and may not even be good for the environment, \nPatrick Barkham, \n\nSun 2 Feb 2020 11.40 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 2 Feb 2020 14.23 EST\n\n, One of the principal arguments in favour of HS2 was the positive effect it would have on the environment – and this was rooted in the belief that high-speed electric trains could help the UK cut its carbon emissions., The rail project, supporters have argued, will lessen demand for carbon-intensive air travel, road freight and car journeys by linking northern England – and potentially Scotland – with the Midlands, London and HS1 to the Channel tunnel and continental Europe., Providing low-carbon alternatives is urgently needed because transport (mostly road) is now Britain’s largest greenhouse gas emitting sector, accounting for 28% of all GHG emissions in 2017., The government has a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but there is disagreement over whether HS2 will really help deliver., At face value, the project should be a good way to cut carbon., Electric trains, particularly if powered by renewable energy, provide low-carbon transport. HS2 claims it can achieve 8g of carbon emissions per person per km. The same journey by car would generate 67g of emissions – and by plane, 170g., But carbon modelling – predicting a new infrastructure’s carbon emissions – is, like all future-gazing, imprecise and dependent on computer modelling., The government’s own calculations for HS2 suggest its carbon emissions could exceed potential savings, even over the railway’s projected 120-year lifetime., HS2 will not cut carbon emissions. According to HS2’s own forecasts, even over 120 years, its overall construction and operation cause carbon emissions of 1.49m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This represents just 1.18% of Britain’s annual transport emissions, but critics say it is still an increase when emissions need to be falling rapidly to reach net zero., HS2’s construction requires vast quantities of concrete and steel, as well as diesel-powered machines moving millions of tonnes of earth., A 2019 report for the High Speed Rail Group (HSRIL), which represents companies with an interest in high-speed rail, estimates construction could be reduced by 20% to 30% with low-carbon innovations, such as hydrogen-powered floodlights and hybrid excavators., HS2’s calculations show its emissions will be offset by the wider decarbonisation of transport it helps create. Some road freight will move to rail as HS2 will enable the wider rail network to take more freight., There will also be a “modal shift” – people choosing to travel by HS2 instead of driving or flying – but this is likely to be small. The Department for Transport suggests only 1% of HS2 passengers will be people who would have flown, and 4% those who would have driven., Some analysts argue that HS2 has presented an overly pessimistic carbon-saving forecast because it is obliged by law to give worst-case scenarios., The HSRILG report points out HS2’s forecasts of 4% and 1% are based on assuming that driving and flying become more affordable while rail fares increase above inflation., In practice, the European average for high speed rail modal shift is 15% from cars and 30% from planes. Furthermore, HS2’s forecasts do not include carbon-saving from increased use of local passenger rail, with HS2 freeing up lines such as the west coast mainline to provide better local services., Julia King, the deputy chair of the committee on climate change, reviewed HS2’s carbon forecasts for Tony Berkeley’s minority report on HS2 and judged them “sensible and conservative” – they do not include highly speculative future scenarios, such as HS2 leading to fewer new roads. If HS2 was well integrated with the European high speed network (and critics say it is not, because it does not connect to HS1) it could become part of a European-wide system saving up to 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050 if all journeys under 1,000km moved to rail., Potential emissions, Construction:, • Huge quantities of steel and concrete including concrete slab-track, • Moving construction materials to site, • Tunnelling (more carbon-intensive than open-air construction), • Construction machines, • Removing soil by truck, • Manufacture of rolling stock, • Journey to work of HS2 employees, Operation:, • Power source not guaranteed to be renewable. Speed of HS2 requires more power, • Ongoing maintenance, • Increased car journeys to HS2 stations, • HS2’s better airport connections could increase flying, • Domestic flights reduced by HS2 could lead to increase in international routes, Potential savings, • Increased rail capacity shifts freight from road to rail, • Increased capacity leads to more local/regional rail journeys, • Modal shift with travellers choosing rail over more carbon-emitting road, • Travellers also switching from flying to high-speed rail, • Carbon sequestration from tree-planting, • HS2 could be powered by all-renewable energy, • HS2 prevents other carbon-intensive infrastructure projects, Sources:, HS2 Limited, 2019, High Speed Two phase 2a, Informationa Paper, E27: carbon, Friends of the Earth, Opportunity Costs of HS2, 2019, Lord Berkeley’s Dissenting Report, 2020, Size of emissions not included because different scenarios give different estimates; figures have not been modelled for all these factors, But Lord Berkeley and other critics argue there are risks that HS2 could increase emissions. More people might drive to HS2 “parkway” stations. And by connecting airports more effectively in London, Birmingham and Manchester, HS2 could lead to an increase in flights. If HS2 cuts demand for domestic flights, says Friends of the Earth, that could simply encourage the aviation industry to switch domestic flight slots to more profitable, and carbon-intensive, international routes., HS2 could be made less carbon intensive. Critics such as Berkeley point out that if HS2 was not built to such a high specification (with top speeds supposedly in excess of continental high speed rail), emissions would be reduced both in operation and construction; it wouldn’t require carbon intensive concrete slab-track, for instance., An independent report by the rail consultants Greengauge in 2012 said HS2’s sustainability would be maximised by reducing its top speed, fully using freed-up capacity on the existing rail network, and creating city-centre stations rather than edge-of-town parkways. Supporters claim HS2’s plans for parkway stations are already morphing into “sustainable urban extensions” with high-density housing and tramways., Ultimately, HS2’s future emissions will depend on wider – and more joined-up – transport and energy policies. It would use less carbon if there was a decarbonisation of electricity supply (rather than another dash for gas), and coherent national policies to reduce car use and air travel. , Friends of the Earth and other critics highlight the “opportunity cost” of HS2: its £106bn price (at least £5bn a year for 20 years) will lead to less investment in more effective carbon-saving transport, such as regional rail, buses, cycling and walking. Berkeley concluded that electrifying existing railways would have a much greater environmental benefit. Friends of the Earth suggest an even less glamorous low-carbon option: making all UK buses free would cost £3bn a year.will hs2 really help cut the uks carbon footprint", "label": 0}, "train-84": {"text": "\nStreatham: police arrive on the scene after man shot by armed officers in terror incident – video\n, This is the moment police arrive on a street in south London after a terrorism-related incident.

He picked up an application form from HMS President, a recruitment vessel moored at the Embankment in central London, near where he worked. But that weekend he met a young man who suggested that instead of enlisting in the navy, it would be “far more fun” for Farnes to follow his example and join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR)., By the end of the second world war, in 1945, Wg Cmdr Farnes, who has died aged 101, had shot down seven enemy aircraft, jointly accounted for a further two, had claims on another two, and damaged 11. To qualify as an “ace”, a pilot needed to shoot down five aircraft; Farnes was the last surviving British flier to achieve that mark., His war effectively began when, on 10 May 1940 as a sergeant pilot, he was flying one of 16 Hurricane fighters from No 501 Squadron (County of Gloucester) that took off from Tangmere aerodrome in Sussex. The squadron was part of the RAF’s impressively named “advanced air striking force”, and was heading for Bétheniville aerodrome near Reims. That day marked the beginning of the Nazi onslaught on France., Two days later the 21-year-old shot down a Heinkel 111 bomber and took part in the downing of another. On 14 May he shared in the destruction of a Dornier 17 bomber and on 27 May he probably shot down another Heinkel., The deployment of Hurricanes – with a few Spitfires later over Dunkirk – was the RAF’s main contribution to the Battle of France. Farnes would later describe the experience as a “shambles” – between May and June 1940, 477 fighter planes were lost and 284 pilots killed. Over that period he found himself, together with his squadron, in retreat: first to Le Mans, west of Paris, and eventually to the Channel Islands, ahead of the advancing Germans. Then it was back to Tangmere. , Next up was the Battle of Britain, which, according to the British at least, began on 10 July 1940. For Farnes and his comrades the initial starting point was Gravesend in Kent, from which they would fly down to RAF Hawkinge, near Folkestone, early each morning., On 12 August 1940 Farnes shot down a Junkers Ju 87 Stuka bomber near North Foreland in Kent, and on 15 August he shot down two more over Hawkinge. More than any other aircraft of that era, the Stuka had seemed to epitomise Blitzkrieg invincibility, with its siren, the “Jericho trumpet” emitting a high-pitched scream as the plane dived. But it failed over England, a sitting duck for faster RAF fighters., Three days after the last Stuka, Farnes shot down a Dornier 17. On 28 August he added a Messerschmitt Me 109E. He damaged six more enemy aircraft during the battle: a Heinkel 111 on 30 August, two Messerschmitt 109s on 2 September, a Messerschmitt 110 on 3 September, and Dornier 17s on 14 and 27 September., On the last day of September, while flying his malfunctioning Hurricane back to Kenley, in Surrey, where he was by then based, he encountered a Junkers Ju 88 bomber flying directly towards him at 1,500 feet. Ducking behind the aircraft, he opened fire – and brought it down. Soon afterwards the Kenley station commander introduced Farnes and the surviving German pilot to each other, but the German declined to shake hands. By the end of October Farnes had probably accounted for another Me 109., In October, by which time the Battle of Britain was nearing its end, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal – then an award for non-commissioned officers – and on 3 December he was commissioned, as a pilot officer. After some months as a training instructor in England in 1941, he was transferred to a training unit in Aden, in what is now Yemen., By February 1942 he was with 229 Squadron, and in March flew with it into Malta. From the summer of 1940 until November 1942 the island was under siege by the Italians and the Germans, and Farnes took command of the squadron after the commanding officer was injured. In May 1942 his Hurricane squadron could be withdrawn, after more Spitfires arrived. Following a spell in Egypt he was posted to Iraq until early 1945. Back in England he commanded squadrons flying Mustangs and Spitfires until 1946. He remained in the RAF until 1958, in a variety of roles, including as an instructor at a jet flying school., Farnes was born in Boscombe, on the edge of Bournemouth, in what was then Hampshire but is now Dorset. His mother, who was unmarried, died in childbirth, while his father, a member of the Australian armed forces, returned home. The nurse who had brought him into the world then adopted him – “I had a wonderful upbringing, just she and I together,” Farnes said. Raised in Walton-on-Thames on the Surrey-London border, he was educated at Surbiton county grammar school and Kingston technical college., It was after securing a job with the Vickers engineering company that Farnes signed on with the RAFVR. His time there included a spell at Gatwick, and six months at St Athan in south Wales as a full-time flier, moving from Tiger Moth biplanes to Fairey Battles and on to Hurricanes. It was a time when the principal European powers were all developing monoplane fighters, and the Hurricane and its contemporary, the Spitfire, were at least as good as, if not better than, their main rival, Nazi Germany’s Messerschmitt Me 109., Then in September 1939, as the second world war began, Sergeant Pilot Farnes joined No 501 Squadron. It was initially based at Filton, near Bristol, but by May 1940 it had moved to France., After leaving the RAF in 1958 Farnes worked in the motor industry, co-ran a builders’ merchants and was a director of the Beach hotel in Worthing., In 1948 he married Pamela Barton. She died in 1989. In 1994 he married Cynthia Lacey, who died in 2012. He is survived by a daughter, Linda, and a son, Jonathan.

Some signatories are worried about the impact the lights are having on wildlife, particularly insects: one woman claims she can hear birds still singing in her garden at 9pm. Others complain the lights are keeping them awake., The Premier League club has defended its methods of keeping the turf in a standard condition, saying it is safer for footballers to play on, but Geliot replied that it should look for alternative ways to maintain the grass., “I really wish Brighton well and recognise that the club does great things for the wider community but surely they can find an alternative? There must be an artificial lighting system where the beams don’t reflect up but are focused down on the pitch,” he said. “At present, this giant splurge of light everywhere must be damaging to wildlife, especially birds and insects, as well as keeping some folk up at night who can’t sleep.”, The 59-year-old photographer, videographer and sculptor said he has taken shots of the orange glow from as far away as the Long Man of Wilmington, the ancient hill figure drawn on the South Downs, which is 11 miles from the stadium., “The light pollution is blocking out some of the stars as well, disturbing sleep and causing damage to the ecosystem,” Geliot said. “The club should be helped to find an alternative lighting system that avoids all this.”, A spokesperson for the club said: “With millions of pounds’ worth of athletic and football talent on display each home matchday, we must not only meet and maintain league regulations for the quality of our playing surface, but we also have a duty of care to our players and those of visiting teams., “In the winter months, while we may at times experienced high rainfall and high winds, with little or no natural sunlight, a grass pitch misses a key element of its natural ability to regenerate and grow after use. We must therefore replicate that loss of light artificially., “We take our responsibilities for the environment very seriously, but like airlines, car manufacturers, supermarkets, consumer goods factories, and other businesses we all use every day, it is impossible for us to eliminate our environmental footprint altogether.”, Jeff Travis, a spokesman for the South Downs national park, said it did not have any powers to force the club to dim or turn off the lights because the stadium was just outside its boundary., “We will, however, seek informal ways to work with the club to see what may be possible to reduce the effects of the lighting on the national park and its ‘Dark Sky’ designation,” Travis said, ahead of the park’s Dark Skies festival, which starts on Friday., Some critics of the petition have claimed fans of Brighton’s greatest rivals, Crystal Palace, are signing up so they can cause reputational damage to the club, but Geliot said: “We have had only two Palace fans make a few rum remarks after signing the petition, but I’ve filtered them out., “This is all about Brighton people only – including loyal fans – who want the club to do something about this problem.”brighton stadium put that light out plea all night glow", "label": 0}, "train-90": {"text": "\nStreatham attacker was released amid fears he felt terrorism 'justified'\n, Sudesh Amman was put under 24/7 armed surveillance within days of leaving prison, \nVikram Dodd and \nDan Sabbagh, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 15.31 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 3 Feb 2020 09.00 EST\n\n, The Streatham attacker was released from a high security prison with investigators fearing he believed terrorist atrocities to be justified, the Guardian has learned., Sudesh Amman, 20, was placed under full surveillance from a unit of 30 officers on the day of his release from Belmarsh prison and within days prompted such concern from counter-terrorism officials that those tailing him were ordered to be armed., In prison he had declined to engage in programmes to manage his risk, and his behaviour during his sentence for terrorist offences following a 2018 conviction caused concern., One source with knowledge of the Amman case said: “He was as much a problem when he came out of prison as when he went in.”, Officers were following Amman on Sunday as he started stabbing people with a knife he stole in a shop, days after controversially being released from a sentence for terrorism offences., Less than 10 seconds after he started his attack on Streatham High Road, armed surveillance officers who had been following him around the clock engaged him. He was shot dead less than 60 seconds after his attack began., One man, who was initially considered to be in a life-threatening condition, is still in hospital., The armed officers tracking Amman were part of a 24/7 surveillance operation, which is more expensive than keeping him in prison. He was released on 23 January, barely a week before he stabbed two people., His release from jail was automatic at the halfway point of his sentence. It is understood that there was no mechanism for a risk assessment to be factored into whether he should be freed., Powerless to stop him being released, prison and probation officials met with police to discuss the serious danger he was seen as posing. He was assessed as posing the highest risk, and they agreed to impose licence conditions on his release including the wearing of an electronic tag, a curfew, where he could go and restrictions on internet use., Police and MI5 also committed extensive resources to place Amman under round the clock surveillance – itself rare and a sign of the danger he was thought to present. The case was considered among the highest priorities by investigators and analysts trying to thwart an atrocity., On Monday evening police said that armed officers had been following Amman as he left a hostel at around 1.20pm on Sunday. Initial witness statements suggest that shortly after he entered a shop he stole a knife and then ran out as he was pursued by a member of staff., As he ran from the shop, he removed packaging from the knife, and once outside attacked two members of public, the police said., He is thought to have been wearing his fake suicide vest covered by a jacket, and thus out of view of the surveillance team following him., Police have identified around 50 witnesses from whom they are gathering statements and are trawling through CCTV footage of the incident., Amman, from Harrow in north-west London, was jailed in December 2018 at the age of 18 after admitting to 13 counts of supporting Islamist terrorism and possessing and sharing Islamic State and al-Qaida propaganda in a family WhatsApp group and on social media. He was sentenced to three years and four months in jail, and served half that time in Belmarsh high security prison, taking in time he had already spent on remand., He had come to police attention in April of that year for posting extremist material and was arrested a month later. At his trial it emerged he had expressed support for Isis and its then leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and sent beheading videos to his girlfriend, advising her to kill her “kuffar” (unbelieving) parents. Amman also wrote about the desirability of conducting a terror attack: “If you can’t make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack.”, Mark Lucraft, the trial judge, wrote in his sentencing remarks: “In terms of mindset, your interest in Islamic extremism and Daesh appears to be more than just an immature fascination. It seems to me on the material here that you are someone with sincerely held and concerning ideological beliefs,” before adding a warning that turned out to be prescient., “You speak about preferring a knife attack to the use of bombs and ask about having a knife delivered to her his girlfriend’s address”., Senior government officials believe the current law gives them no power to check if someone still poses a danger and to block their release at the halfway point of their sentence., But soon after this decision, he was assessed to be even more dangerous than first thought and surveillance officers were ordered to be armed, multiple sources said., The armed surveillance officers were carrying concealed pistols for their own personal protection and hence were able to stop Amman when he struck., After his conviction, acting Met Commander Alexis Boon, head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, said Amman had a “fascination with dying in the name of terrorism”, as seen in a notepad recovered from his home. “Amman had scrawled his ‘life goals’ in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to ‘Jannah’, the afterlife,” she said.streatham attacker was under full surveillance from day of release", "label": 0}, "train-91": {"text": "Woman found not guilty after stabbing abusive father to death, Jessica Breeze weeps in dock after being acquitted of murder and manslaughter, A woman who stabbed her abusive father to death has been acquitted of his murder and manslaughter., Jessica Breeze, 20, from Middlesbrough, denied murdering Colin Brady, 49, at their family home in June after a violent argument., Breeze told Teesside crown court that “controlling” Brady had hit her and threatened to kill both her and her mother before the incident., The nursery worker, who stabbed Brady in the back with a kitchen knife, was found not guilty of both charges on Monday. She wept in the dock as the verdict was read out., Breeze had earlier described her father as “controlling”, and recalled how he would “smash the place up” if she returned home late., Asked by her barrister, Simon Russell Flint QC, if she had ever reported her father’s abuse to the police, Breeze replied: “No. I was scared. I thought it was pointless.”, Brady died from blood loss at James Cook university hospital after suffering an 18cm-deep wound to his left lung., He had previously been convicted for violence, including causing grievous bodily harm with intent., A police officer described a past attack on Breeze’s mum, Kelly, as the worst domestic assault he had seen., The court heard that on the night of Brady’s death, the family had been sharing a takeaway when an argument broke out after Breeze’s parents discovered she had been seeing her boyfriend when she said she had been at work., Brady allegedly hit his then 19-year-old daughter several times before her mother intervened. Breeze told the jury: “He said he was going to kill us.”, The jury was told that he then picked up a knife and asked if the women wanted him to cut his own throat, before they fled upstairs., Although the prosecution said Breeze stabbed her father in the back as he was leaving the house, she claimed to have “no memory of picking up the knife”., In a statement read outside court, her solicitor, Sean Grainger, said the jury had accepted Breeze had been “acting in lawful self-defence of herself and her mother”., “Further, whilst Jessica was brought up in a highly toxic home environment where she and her mother were regularly subject to extreme physical and emotional abuse by her father, Jessica wishes to make it clear she loved her father, she still does and she wishes he was still here., “She now wishes to rebuild her life, get back to work and move on from the seven-month ordeal she has endured since her arrest.”, Following the verdict, a Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson said the murder charge against Breeze had been “wholly appropriate” considering the circumstances of Brady’s death., “Regardless of the alleged provocation for the attack, the victim was attacked in the back as he walked away from the defendant,” they added., “He was stabbed with such force that it passed from his back through his entire left lung and into his chest.

The key question he bequeaths in death is how society deals with any future Ammans., His mother, Haleema Faraz Khan, 41, originally from Sri Lanka, told journalists that when she first heard of Sunday’s attack, she “had a feeling” Amman, 20, the eldest of her six children, was responsible because it was in south London., He had been staying at a hostel in the area since his automatic release from prison on 23 January. He had served half of a 40-month sentence, imposed at the Old Bailey in December 2018, when he pleaded guilty to possessing and distributing terrorist material., It was there that his mother visited him on Thursday, and she spoke again to her son by phone on Sunday. Just a few hours later, he grabbed a knife from a convenience store and launched his random stabbing spree, injuring two people, one seriously. A third person was injured by flying glass during the police gunfire., “I spoke to him on the phone on Sunday. He said: ‘Mum, I want some biryani ... your mutton biryani,” Khan told Sky News in tears., “He was fine when I went to see him. He became more religious inside prison, that’s where I think he became radicalised. He was watching and listening to things online which brainwashed him. Before he went to prison he was not that religious. After he came out he was really religious.”, She added: “He was a polite, kind, lovely boy. He was always smiling. I’m so upset, he was only 20 years old.”, It has been reported that concerns were raised about him in prison, but evidence shows Amman was radicalised before his time at Belmarsh., There was no sign of remorse when he appeared in the Old Bailey dock, smiling as the sentence was passed and even waving to his mother and brother in the public gallery., He was first flagged to counter-terrorism by a Dutch blogger who focused on exposing online extremism and in April 2018 noticed Amman was active on the Telegram messaging app., Amman’s posts included an image of a knife, along with two firearms on a black Shahada flag, and the Arabic words meaning “armed and ready, April 3”. He had linked it to a YouTube video of a pro-gay rights protester, due to be at Speakers’ Corner, Hyde Park, and urged others to “all unite together and attack one another”., When police arrested Amman, they found a stash of terrorist material, including manuals on bomb-making, knife fighting and close combat. They also seized an airgun, a black flag and a combat knife., He had shared an al-Qaida magazine in a family WhatsApp group, including images of poses reminiscent of Islamic State-inspired supporters, and focusing on the idea of the “lone jihad”., He had sent beheading videos to his girlfriend, and urged her to kill her “kuffar” (non-believer) parents. In messages to her, he pledged his allegiance to Isis, and his wish to carry out acid attacks, his trial heard., Elsewhere, he wrote that he preferred the idea of a knife attack over bombs, and discussed whether he would stand his ground if police came to arrest him. In one notebook, in which he had made notes on explosives and detonators, he wrote of his “goals in life”. These included “die as a shuhada” (martyr) and go to “Jannah” (paradise)., Jailing him after his subsequent guilty plea, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said Amman’s interest in Islamic extremism and Isis “appears to be more than just an immature fascination”. Much of his fascination with conducting an attack was focused on using a knife, but reference was also made to committing acid attacks on mopeds, he said. It was clear, he added, that Amman was “someone with sincerely held and concerning ideological beliefs”., Amman had originally been arrested on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack, but in the event was charged only in relation to ownership and distribution of terrorist propaganda and instruction manuals., After his sentencing, just over one year ago, acting commander Alexis Boon, then head of the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, said: “It is not clear how Amman became radicalised but it is apparent from his messages that it had been at least a year in development.”, At the time of his 2018 arrest, Amman was living in Harrow, north London, with his mother and younger siblings in a rented house. He had moved from Park high school in Stanmore and was studying maths and science at the College of North West London. The college said in a statement that he was a student there from September 2017 to May 2018 “during which time there were no indications that he was potentially linked to terrorist activities”., According to his mother, his ambition was to study biomedical science. He had one previous conviction, for possession of an offensive weapon – a bottle – and cannabis. , A former neighbour in Harrow, Anthony, said the father had been absent in recent years, and lived abroad, though the family did go on trips to see him., Another neighbour described them as a “very nice” family, sympathising with the mother who she said was “raising the children on her own”., Anthony, however, claimed police had been called to the house on at least two occasions in recent years. “He Amman was actually a nice kid, he wasn’t a bad kid,” he recalled, saying he had lived on the street for his whole life., “They the family were noisy, always trouble in there. The house was smashed up, there were fights inside,” he said., “I used to see him go to the mosque wearing traditional Islamic dress … Before that he was all right and he started going there and he kind of changed, you could see it in him.”, He continued: “He was actually an intelligent kid. He did science and maths. Then he dropped out. I used to see him all the time where he was in and out, talk to him and stuff.”, A teenage girl who did not wish to be named said she knew Amman from the neighbourhood. He used to talk about being a terrorist, she said, but she and others thought he was joking., A former schoolfriend spoke of his regret at the life Amman had chosen, telling Sky News: “It really is a shame that he has done such a tragic thing, as I believe that Sudesh really had potential to make it far in life.”, Police were conducting detailed forensic searches of properties linked to Amman, including the hostel.

He denies possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and other related charges., O’Connor was arrested on 9 April last year after police found a small loaded revolver in a sock underneath the front passenger seat of an Uber he was travelling in, which he had booked using a false name., The rapper told the court that on 8 April he had arranged to meet a cannabis dealer he had contacted on Snapchat to purchase 14 grams of cannabis. He said he had purchased cannabis from the dealer, known as D, more than 10 times previously., He claimed that once he got into a car with the dealer at a prearranged meeting place in north-west London, things started to go wrong and he believed he was being kidnapped. O’Connor told the court that the door of the car was locked and he panicked. “He put a gun in my face, I was panicking a lot. He said he knew where I lived and where my mum lived. With a gun in your face there’s not really a way out of it.”, He told the court the dealer told him “I need you to hold something for me” and handed him a gun wrapped in tissue, which the dealer told him he had to hold on to until the next day before delivering it to a drop-off point., O’Connor, who was living in Gerrards Cross, south Buckinghamshire, at the time of the alleged offences, told the court he had witnessed a lot of violence in his childhood and had moved from his home in Kennington, south London, to live with his grandmother in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, after having a gun held against his head by a group of older boys he did not know when he was 12 years old., “When I told the police about the gun to my head nothing really happened, so I didn’t feel they could help in any way,” he told the court., He said by the time he was 14 older boys forced him to get involved in what he described as “country” drug dealing, predating county lines. “We all had to go up to the country to sell drugs. If you don’t agree with what’s going on, you can’t not do what you’re told. You don’t have a choice.”, He told how on 4 September 2014 he was arrested in a car in Andover, Hampshire, in possession of heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply. He said he had been told to “bank” the drugs - hide them inside him - but he said he was too scared to do that and kept them in his underpants instead where police found them., “Because I lost the drugs I was told that the only way to clear the debt was to hold more drugs. They said it was my fault because I didn’t bank the drugs.”, After two spells of approximately a year in youth custody for drug and weapons-related offences, he began to succeed as a drill artist. He had been writing and performing rap music since the age of 11, but after his second period of imprisonment his music began to take off, he said., He told the court that in his music he was reporting on incidents of crime he saw around him in south London rather than becoming involved in committing the crimes himself., “Drill music is rapping about drugs, knives, violence – it’s reporting on what’s going on in the area. It started in Chicago but UK took the sound to try to make it their own,” he said., “In drill you antagonise people, you make it sound as outrageous as possible, you take something that someone said and make it even better. Everyone wants to have the best drill song, it’s a common genre of music. I have said certain things that I haven’t seen but I have heard. Yes, this is what’s really going on., “I have to sound as real as possible otherwise you don’t get far. It’s all about YouTube views. If you say something, everyone talks about you and you get more views. Rap doesn’t always have to make sense, it has to rhyme. I don’t look scary so I have to say something that looks more than I am.”, O’Connor told the court he signed to Since ’93, a label within Sony, and released a mixtape, Call Me Loose. One track, Forrest Gump, attracted 12m views on YouTube; another, Money &amp; Beef, drew 2-3m views., From 18-25 March last year he embarked on a tour across the UK. “Drake came to my show on 25 March,” he told the court, referring to the Canadian hip-hop artist. “Drake to me is the biggest rapper in the world right now. He put out a statement saying my music was part of his inspiration. When he came to my show it was a big deal, he was right next to all my family.”, At the time of his arrest, O’Connor said, he had a lot of projects lined up, including a track he had recorded with Stormzy., The case continues.rapper loski tells court death threats forced him carry gun", "label": 0}, "train-95": {"text": "Streatham attack: emergency laws will stop serving terrorist offenders being released without review – as it happened, Justice secretary Robert Buckland says terrorist offenders will have to serve at least two thirds of sentence before parole board considers release, \nHaroon Siddique, \nJessica Murray and \nKevin Rawlinson, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 13.15 EST\n\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 3 Feb 2020 02.33 EST\n\n\n, \n\n1.15pm EST\n13:15\n\n, That’s all from us for this evening.

I’d simply remind him of the choices that we had to make at the beginning of the last decade, the difficulty we were placed in and the fact that we are increasing counter-terrorism funding and, indeed, bearing down upon the risk that we face., There’s never been any question, any time of the Conservative government’s period in power that we have prioritised resources over the need to protect the public. We will continue to put public protection at the centre of our deliberations irrespective of the cost., Buckland also says increased separation of prisoners who were convicted of terror offences from the general population would risk creating “colleges of terrorism” if it meant such offenders simply being held together., Updated\nat 1.02pm EST\n, \n\n12.52pm EST\n12:52\n\n, The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, criticised the government over cuts to the justice system during its time in power., Tragically, the cuts that we have seen over the previous decade across our justice system to the police and to prisons, to probation and to the CPS, have left our communities less safe, which is why our justice system is in a state of crisis., It will, of course, take time for the full facts around yesterday’s terrible attack to come out and we owe it to those affected to carefully assess what happened and take the action necessary to reduce the risk of similar attacks happening again., Experts have raised serious concerns about the impact of austerity on the government’s programmes for dealing with terrorist offenders., Burgon also said Labour would consider the proposals made by the UK government around sentencing., We will look at the proposals that have been referred to in the secretary of state’s statement because our priority must be to keep the public safe, but to be clear – the government cannot use sentencing as a way of distracting from their record of bringing the criminal justice system to breaking point., Updated\nat 1.03pm EST\n, \n\n12.47pm EST\n12:47\n\n, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour MP for Streatham, where the attack happened, tells Buckland that her constituents remain shaken. She says: “The minister says that we are at the forefront of tackling terrorism and we have robust measures in place, but those measures didn’t prevent what happened in my constituency yesterday.”, She adds that she cannot fathom a situation where someone so dangerous as to need surveillance as soon as they are released from prison could be released.

The order signed by the Home Secretary put a terrorist suspect under close supervision, described by some as being similar to house arrest, with restrictions on who they meet and where they go., They were repealed and replaced by measures known as TPIMS (Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures) in 2011, which the government said was a less intrusive system which addressed concerns about civil liberties with time limits and a higher test to be met for one to be brought into force.streatham attack sudesh amman freed after serving half his sentence live news", "label": 0}, "train-96": {"text": "\nDanish police freeze Hyde Park mansion of Sanjay Shah\n, Police freeze property owned by British businessman accused of defrauding Danish taxpayers, \nRupert Neate Wealth correspondent, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 12.54 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 11.39 EST\n\n, Danish police have frozen a £14.7m mansion near Hyde Park, in central London, owned by Sanjay Shah, a British multi-millionaire businessman accused of defrauding Danish taxpayers out of £1.5bn., Denmark’s serious economic and international crime police department said on Monday it had frozen the property owned by a suspect “believed to have scammed more than 12bn Danish kroner (£1.5bn)”. The Danish authorities did not identify the suspect., However, the Guardian can confirm that the property is owned by Sanjay Shah, a 50-year-old former hedge fund boss who is living in Dubai. Denmark has been pursuing Shah for five years over a complex tax fraud., A spokesman for Shah, who lives on a private island in Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah development, confirmed that his London mansion had been frozen., The spokesman, Jack Irvine, said it was “mysterious” that Denmark had announced the freezing today given that the authorities took control of the house months ago. Irvine said Shah denies any wrongdoing. The claims are subject to a civil case at London’s high court brought against Shah by Denmark’s tax authority, Skat., In a high court filing in 2018, Shah was described by Skat as “the primary individual said to be responsible for the fraudulent scheme”. Irvine said Shah, who was born in London, would not return to the UK to give evidence, fearing extradition to Denmark., Shah has entertained global superstars in Dubai, where he used to drive around in a white Rolls Royce., He established Autism Rocks, a charity he set up to raise money for autism research, and put on charity concerts featuring artists including Elton John, Snoop Dogg, Prince, Ed Sheeran and Jennifer Lopez. He also founded a festival in Dubai called Blended, which has featured the BackStreet Boys, Melanie C and Lemar. He is said to own a total of six homes on the Palm Jumeirah, where he had also moored a £1m yacht., “I regret buying my yacht,” he told the United Arab Emirates newspaper The National in 2017. “It cost £1m and, like a brand-new car, you’ve lost half the value as soon as you try to sell it. It’s moored on the Palm Jumeirah, not far from us, and I have a licence to sail, but it’s far enough that we have to drive to it in summer, remember to take food and drink with us, hire a captain and deck hand for the day if I don’t want to sail myself, and plan around the kids’ activities at the weekend … It’s for sale, but no one is buying.” Irvine said he had subsequently sold the yacht., Shah is accused by Denmark of making bogus claims via his hedge fund Solo Capital, which defrauded the Danish tax office out of £1.5bn between 2012 and 2015. The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) raided the offices of Solo Capital in 2016. The hedge fund has closed down., The NCA’s director of investigations, Nikki Holland, said: “The NCA conducted an initial investigation into an alleged fraud to the value of over £1 bn committed against the Danish and Belgian tax authorities between 2012 and 2015., “It was agreed, with the support of the Crown Prosecution Service, that investigative challenges would prevent the NCA being able to present evidence which would have a realistic possibility of leading to a prosecution in the UK. This case was transferred to the Danish authorities in October 2019, and we continue to provide support as required.”, • This article was amended on 6 February 2020 because an earlier version referred to Shah’s mansion being seized, as the English translation of the Danish State Prosecutor’s Office notice said. The State Prosecutor’s office has since confirmed to Shah’s lawyers that the property has been “frozen, not confiscated”.danish police seize hyde park mansion from sanjay shah", "label": 0}, "train-97": {"text": "\nNo terrorism offenders to be released without review, says minister\n, Emergency legislation will retrospectively toughen terms of sentences being served by 220 terrorist offenders, \nJamie Grierson Home affairs correspondent, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 12.52 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 20.10 EST\n\n, The government has responded to the knife attack in Streatham by announcing sweeping legal changes to prevent the automatic release of terrorist offenders., In a hastily arranged House of Commons statement a day after the south London stabbings, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, set out plans for emergency legislation that would stop any terror offenders being released without parole board risk assessments., And in a move that is likely to face legal challenge, Buckland said that the proposals would apply to existing as well as future offenders, meaning prisoners currently due for release halfway through their sentence could now face years more in prison., The move – which critics view as a breach of norms governing retrospective legislation – came in response to the revelation that neither the police nor the parole board were able to stop the release one week ago of 20-year-old Sudesh Amman, who was shot dead by plainclothes officers after he stabbed two people in south London., The government faced immediate accusations of developing policy on the hoof, ignoring the crisis in prisons and scapegoating “the influence of lawyers” on sentencing policy through anonymous briefings., But Buckland hinted that the government might push for even more draconian powers that would prevent prisoners convicted of terror offences being released until the Parole Board considered them to pose no risk., Announcing the changes, the justice secretary told the House of Commons: “Yesterday’s appalling incident makes the case plainly for immediate action. We cannot have the situation, as we saw tragically in yesterday’s case, where an offender – a known risk to innocent members of the public – is released early by automatic process of law without any oversight by the Parole Board., “We will be doing everything we can to protect the public, that is our primary duty. We will, therefore, introduce emergency legislation to ensure an end to terrorist offenders getting released automatically having served half of their sentence with no check or review., “The underlying principle has to be that offenders will no longer be released early automatically and that any release before the end of their sentence will be dependent on risk assessment by the Parole Board., “We face an unprecedented situation of severe gravity, and as such it demands the government responds immediately and that this legislation will apply to serving prisoners.”, All terrorist offenders would have to serve two thirds of their sentence before being eligible for a Parole Board assessment, Buckland added., Hinting that further restrictive regimes may be introduced, he said: “We will review whether the current maximum penalties and sentencing framework for terrorist offences is indeed sufficient or comprehensive on the underlying principle that terrorist offenders should no longer be released until the Parole Board is satisfied that they are no longer a risk to the public.”, The changes are unlikely to affect many prisoners as a significant number are already serving either life sentences or extended determinate sentences, both of which require Parole Board intervention before release. A small number of terrorist offenders, like Amman, are sentenced to standard determinate sentences that under current legislation are eligible for automatic release at the halfway point., The proposals come a week after a broad package of counter-terrorism measures was announced by the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, which included plans to introduce lie detector tests for terrorist offenders as well as the recruitment of specialist counter-terrorism probation officers., Among the proposals, some of which are to be introduced in a new counter-terrorism bill, are plans to end early release on licence for terrorist offenders who receive extended determinate sentences and a mandatory minimum of 14 years in prison for those convicted of preparing acts of terrorism or directing a terrorist organisation., Clare Collier, advocacy director for Liberty, the civil liberties and human rights group, immediately questioned the legality of a retrospective change to sentence conditions., She said: “The government’s response to recent terror attacks is a cause of increasing concern for our civil liberties., “From last month’s kneejerk lie detector proposal, to today’s threat to break the law by changing people’s sentences retrospectively, continuing to introduce measures without review or evidence is dangerous and will create more problems than it solves., “It’s clear the UK’s counter-terror system is in chaos and desperately needs proper scrutiny and review.”, Joanna Cherry, the justice and home affairs spokesperson for the SNP at Westminster, immediately highlighted difficulties with retrospectively altering legislation., She said: “He Buckland has said he intends to introduce emergency legislation making retrospective provision in relation to those sentenced before the law was changed I wonder can he assure me that the usual legal difficulties with retrospective legislation have been addressed to his satisfaction.”, Buckland argued that the changes related to the “administration” of a sentence, not its length or type. He said: “We are talking about the administration of a sentence – the way it is dealt with, as opposed to the length of it or the type of it. I think for that reason looking at the administration of a sentence is entirely appropriate and what I would regard as a reasonable approach.”, Cherry hit out at reports that an anonymous No 10 source had been briefing journalists that “the system for dealing with terrorism has significant problems because of the shocking influence of lawyers on policy”., “Will Buckland join me in condemning these anonymous briefings and will he agree with me that there’s plenty of room for introducing robust anti-terrorism policies that are rule-of-law compliant?”, Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, attacked the state of the prison and probation service amid questions raised over the effectiveness of rehabilitation in prison and monitoring terror suspects in the community., “Our priority must be to keep the public safe. But to be clear, the government cannot use sentencing as a way of distracting from their record of bringing the criminal justice system to breaking point.”, In a statement, the Parole Board said: “Given the recent events at London Bridge and Streatham, the Parole Board understands and welcomes the government’s plans to ensure that terrorist offenders are not released automatically, as occurred in these incidents, but are instead considered by an independent panel of the Parole Board., “Our overriding priority is the protection of the public. The independent Parole Board will not direct the release of an offender unless we are satisfied, taking account of all the evidence, that detention is no longer necessary for the protection of the public., “The board’s focus is rightly on those who have committed the most serious criminal offences and it is vital that the most serious offenders are subject to a proper assessment before their release.”no terrorism offenders to be released without review says minister", "label": 0}, "train-98": {"text": "\nBoy fell from cliff while out of sight on Scouts trip, inquest told\n, Ben Leonard, 16, of Stockport died after suffering serious head injury in north Wales, \nSteven Morris and agency, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 11.18 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 15.10 EST\n\n, A teenage scout was out of the sight of group leaders when he slipped and fell from a coastal cliff in north Wales, an inquest has heard., Ben Leonard, 16, from Stockport in Greater Manchester, was in Llandudno on an organised trip with the Reddish explorer scouts when he suffered a serious head injury in the fall., His mother, Jackie Leonard, broke down in tears as she told the coroner’s court in Ruthin: “We just miss him.”, She said the teenager, who had achieved the chief scout’s gold award, received his GCSE results three days before his death and had enrolled to study film studies at a college in Salford. In a statement, she said: “He was a wonderful boy and a fantastic son and brother.”, David Pojur, an assistant coroner for north Wales, told the jury a group of nine boys, aged between 14 and 18, had camped near Betws-y-Coed on 25 August with the scout leader Sean Glaister and assistant leaders Mary Carr and Gareth Williams., The group was due to climb Snowdon but Glaister made the decision to go to Llandudno instead because of bad weather, the court heard., Pojur said that at the seaside resort Carr and Williams walked with eight of the boys through Happy Valley to the Great Orme on the coast., The court heard Ben and two friends walked more slowly than the rest of the group and took a different path. Pojur said: “The group of three continued on to the Great Orme and we will hear how they were out of sight.”, The court heard Ben and his friends explored the top of the Orme and Ben, who attempted to find a path down to the road below, was seen by witness Philip Taylor., The coroner said: “He saw Ben standing, edging along a narrow ledge before climbing down to another short step. He saw Ben take another short step, moments later slipping and falling., “He wasn’t able to regain his footing nor hold on to anything and he fell on to a steep grass bank below.”, An air ambulance attended but Ben died from a serious head injury, Pojur said., He told jurors they would have to consider how the trip on 26 August 2018 was organised, the training of the scout leaders and their knowledge of the Great Orme, communication and instructions to the boys and between the leaders, and whether risk assessments were done., The inquest is expected to last four to five days.boy fell from cliff while out sight scouts trip inquest told ben leonard", "label": 0}, "train-99": {"text": "\nAt £307m per mile of track, can the cost of HS2 be justified?\n, \nAt £307m per mile of track, can the cost of HS2 be justified?\n, HS2 is one of the most controversial and costly rail projects of the modern era. There are strong views for and against – and Boris Johnson could decide its future as early as this week. Here, we look at the economic arguments against HS2, \nNils Pratley, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 10.33 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 3 Feb 2020 06.31 EST\n\n, The economic case against HS2 is straightforward: its critics say there must be better ways to spend £100bn on rail infrastructure., That £100bn figure is a rounded number, but precision on costs has never been a hallmark of HS2. When approval was granted in 2010, the budget was put at £30bn. That quickly become £43bn. Then, in 2015, it was £56bn, with ministers describing the figure as HS2’s “only” budget as recently as last summer, as if trying to will savings into existence., The arrival of a hard deadline for a decision on whether to proceed has injected greater realism into the calculations. Allan Cook ordered a “chairman’s stocktake” when he arrived at HS2 in December 2018 and last September came up with £72bn-£78bn in 2015 prices, or £81bn-£88bn in 2019 prices., Even that sum, though, has not been the last word. The official Oakervee report is thought to warn that £106bn is possible if problems aren’t fixed. The National Audit Office noted last month that phase 2 of the project – the routes from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds – is still at an early stage of development, so “we do not think that it is possible, as yet, to estimate with certainty what the final cost could be”., Every escalation in costs has dented the economic case for HS2 – £106bn equates to an astonishing £307m per mile to build 345 miles of high-speed track., Government studies used to say the full Y-shaped line would generate benefits of £2.30-£2.50 for every pound spent. The methodology was disputed, since one key assumption was that savings in journey times would make business travellers more productive, a questionable idea in the age of laptops and 5G – or 6G or 7G by the time HS2’s trains are seen on tracks., The Oakervee report, still unpublished, may put the benefits at only £1.50 for every £1 spent. Lord Berkeley, the dissenting member of the Oakervee panel, reckons 60p is more like it. One reason, he argued, is that running 18 trains per hour, as assumed in original projections of HS2’s revenues, is impossible. No other high-speed network in the world achieves that; 14 trains per hour may be the practical maximum., The key question now is: if you were given a fixed £100bn, or even HS2’s own estimate of £85bn-ish, to improve the UK’s rail network, would you throw the lot at HS2, a track that will primarily only connect major cities? What about frustrated commuters who only want to travel between Blackpool and Manchester?, Lord Berkeley has concluded that “the greatest need and demand for improved rail services is within the regions … since services to and from London are of better quality”. HS2, he argued, only helps in this regard at the northern end, where tracks are within the proposed Northern Powerhouse Rail area. HS2’s aim of providing better north-south links “is just as likely to attract more jobs from the regions to London than the other way round”, he said., That last idea is hotly disputed by the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool, among others, but there is the obvious danger that HS2 – the biggest infrastructure project in Europe – ends up crowding out other spending on rail., Northern Powerhouse Rail would connect Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle and few doubt that it would work best in combination with HS2. But the contrast between political backing for the two projects is stark. HS2 Ltd has spent £7bn already, but Northern Powerhouse Rail is still described by its own backers as an “emerging vision” and a “blueprint”., It is why the pro-HS2 lobby’s cry that their project is the only “shovel-ready” proposal is so powerful. But it also why many fear that the northern section of HS2, if it is built, will end up being squeezed for savings to pay for over-runs in the south., Many of the underlying problems with HS2’s expense – an over-specified design, an obsession with faster speeds than the French TGV network – are not new. They were identified as long ago as 2015 in a blistering report by the House of Lords economic affairs committee that found “it is impossible to agree with the government that HS2 is the only solution to increase capacity on the rail network”., Extra capacity could be provided by “incremental improvements to the existing network, a new conventional railway line, or a new high-speed line (of which HS2 is only one option)”. It urged the government to rethink and stop giving serious consideration only to HS2. Investment in rail infrastructure in the north should be the priority., By 2019, when the Lords returned to the subject,  peers concluded that “little progress” had been made in answering their questions and warned ominously: “The north is being short-changed by the government’s present plans, especially as construction on HS2 is starting in the south. Any overcrowding relief from HS2 will mainly benefit London commuters.”, Or one could go further back to 2013, when Lord Mandelson, one of Labour’s backers of the scheme in 2010, said he’d changed his mind and now feared HS2 “has the potential to end up a mistake, damaging in particular to those people that it was intended to help”., Labour’s original estimates of HS2’s costs were “almost entirely speculative”, he told the FT., On one thing both sides can agree: the past decade has been an exercise in how not to procure a railway.at 307m per mile of track can the cost of hs2 be justified", "label": 0}, "train-100": {"text": "\nBurglar raped and murdered elderly woman in her bed, court hears\n, Reece Dempster accused of attacking Dorothy Woolmer after breaking into her London home, PA Media, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 09.37 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 10.08 EST\n\n, An 89-year-old woman was raped and murdered in her bed by a 23-year-old man looking for money, a court has heard., Reece Dempster attacked Dorothy Woolmer overnight on 3 and 4 August last year, inflicting severe injuries to her head and groin area after breaking into her home in Tottenham, north London, his trial at the Old Bailey was told., Dempster spent about seven hours in the property after entering through a back door at night and arming himself with a truncheon he found in her downstairs cupboard while looking for cash, jurors heard., He fled the scene the following morning, just before 6am, and went to his father’s house nearby. He then left the property with his father nine minutes later, wearing a change of clothes, the court heard., Woolmer, whose husband, Ken, died in 2017, was 4ft 11in tall and weighed less than eight stone, jurors were told., The court heard how Dempster made several journeys on foot in the area in the hours after the alleged murder, including coming metres away from the crime scene., Woolmer’s body was discovered later that morning, semi-naked, in her bed by her sister and a close friend who were concerned when she failed to answer the door or telephone., Anthony Orchard QC, prosecuting, said: “It is the prosecution case that Reece Dempster went to Dorothy Woolmer’s address looking for money. You will hear he had been there once before to do some gardening., “He had ‘cased the premises’. He knew a vulnerable elderly lady lived there. CCTV evidence that evening indicates he may have been drinking, but he clearly knew what he was doing.”, Orchard said Dempster probably broke in through the back door some time after 10.47pm. “He was a trespasser,” he said., “He looked for money downstairs. He moved upstairs and found Dorothy Woolmer alone in her bed. He attacked her, battering her about the head numerous times, probably because he wanted to know where the money was kept, before sexually assaulting her.”, The court heard Dempster was seen on CCTV to vomit at least three times upon leaving the property., Dempster, of Tottenham, admits manslaughter but denies murder, one count of rape and two counts of assault by penetration., The trial judge, Mr Justice Edis, told jurors the case would involve “some very sad and some very disturbing evidence”., He said: “You will have a strong emotional reaction to what happened in this case – that is just inevitable.

He has not expressed any remorse at all. It is a sad case.”, He told the defendant: “For whatever reason, you have an obsession with Emily Maitlis and it is your belief that you have been wronged by her and you have been wronged by the law., “You are convinced that you are in love with her and, no doubt, you think she is in love with you. I am afraid I have to sentence you on the basis that you are a long way from any reality dawning on you., “If you love Emily Maitlis as you say you do, one might be forgiven for saying you have a very strange way of showing it, because you have made her life, in many ways, a misery., “She can’t live a free life because of you. She is forever looking over her shoulder to see if you are there. If you keep breaching the order, all the court can do is lock you up., “This at the moment has to be treated as a life-long obsession by you. All the court can do is try to protect Ms Maitlis and her family as best as it can. Until you can take the step to stop being the unrequited 19-year-old that you were at the start of all of this, nothing will ever change.”, Ian Way, prosecuting, said Maitlis had not been approached for a victim impact statement because “each repeated episode compounds the distress”., Way said that since a sentencing hearing at Oxford magistrates court, where Vines was handed a restraining order that extended to Maitlis’s family including her mother, Vines had “persistently and systematically breached the order”., He sent letters and emails to Maitlis via the BBC, the Newsnight programme and her mother, including one occasion where he telephoned Marion Maitlis., Summarising the contents of the letters, Way said: “He was despairing over the situation between Emily and himself, and he did not feel his rights as a defendant were being respected – and until then he would not abide by the order., “He was troubled by Emily’s treatment of him whilst at university. He said he was in love with her and he was distressed when she ceased all contact with him.

The attack left one person initially in a life-threatening condition., After a man with a similar sentencing history killed two people at London Bridge in November, Johnson promised to change the law to end automatic early release for those convicted of terrorism offences., On Monday he said this could now be applied to those already in jail., “The difficulty is how to apply that retrospectively to the cohort of people who currently qualify,” the prime minister said. “We do think it’s time to take action to ensure that people, irrespective of the law we’re bringing in, people in the current stream do not qualify automatically for early release, people convicted of terrorist offences., “I hope people understand that the anomaly we need to clear up is the process by which some people are still coming out under automatic early release without any kind of scrutiny or parole system.”, More details would emerge soon via the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, Johnson added., Answering a question about how people could be reassured, Johnson said the aim was that no one jailed for terrorism should be released “without some process of parole or scrutiny by real experts in the matter – cynical, hardened people who can look into their eyes and really think whether or not these people again pose a danger to the public”., Deradicalising Islamists was difficult, Johnson said: “Looking at the problems we have with re-educating and reclaiming and rehabilitating people who succumb to Islamism is very, very hard, and very tough., “It can happen but the instances of success are really very few, and we need to be frank about that. We need to think about how we handle that in our criminal justice system.”, Speaking earlier, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, rejected the idea that cuts to prison and probation services had made it harder to rehabilitate or monitor terrorism suspects., He told BBC1’s Breakfast: “The counter-terrorism budget, which is what we’re dealing with here, has actually been increased every year for the last five or six years., “It is now up 30% or 40% from where it was several years ago. And we just announced a 10% increase, taking it to almost £1bn for the forthcoming year.”, He said the government was doubling the number of specific counter-terrorism probation officers and creating new places in probationary hostels. “This is all forming part of the plans that we’re putting in place to keep people safe.”, After Sunday’s attack, three victims were taken by ambulance to south London hospitals. One man, in his 40s, was no longer considered to be in a life-threatening condition after treatment, police said. A woman, in her 50s, who had non-life-threatening injuries has been discharged from hospital., Police said a second woman in her 20s, who sustained minor injuries believed to have been caused by glass after the discharge of a police firearm, was still receiving treatment., The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he was alarmed that Amman had been freed even though he was considered a sufficient danger to be followed by armed police., “Why didn’t the probation service, the prison service, properly punish and reform him?” Khan asked on BBC1’s Breakfast. “And also, why was he allowed to be released if the authorities knew he was a danger?”, Speaking earlier, on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, he said the attack was “clearly foreseeable”. “But for an inch this way or that way, but for the brilliance of the medics and the speed of the police, there would have been two fatalities and many more,” Khan said., “And that’s one of the reasons why I’m not just frustrated but I’m angry at the changes made in the past and the lack of progress in making the changes we were promised in November.”, Mobile phone footage of the incident showed officers wearing plain clothes arriving on the scene at high speed, firing about five gunshots and killing Amman outside a branch of Boots pharmacy. They were carrying pistols that are normally used by surveillance officers., Police continued their investigations overnight, with search warrants being used at two addresses, in south London and Bishop’s Stortford., Amman pledged allegiance to Islamic State in messages to his girlfriend at the time he was jailed, and said he wanted to carry out terrorist attacks., He wrote to her: “If you can’t make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack.”prison cuts rishi sunak terrorism suspects streatham attacker", "label": 0}, "train-103": {"text": "\nStreatham MP reacts to terror incident in her constituency – video\n, Bell Ribiero-Addy, the Labour MP for Streatham, comments on the attack on Sunday in which a man stabbed two people on Streatham High Road before being shot dead by police.

There are strong views for and against – and Boris Johnson could decide its future as early as this week. Here, we look at the economic arguments for HS2, \nGwyn Topham Transport correspondent, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 06.31 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 19.13 EST\n\n, With the escalating cost of HS2, a changed political landscape and greater awareness of environmental concerns, the arguments for high-speed rail are having to be remade., But the underpinning belief articulated by the Conservative-led coalition government in backing HS2 should still hold sway, argue those who believe this is an important way of “levelling up” the regions., The aim, spelled out in a 2013 strategic case, was to “build a stronger, more balanced economy capable of delivering lasting growth and widely shared prosperity”. And transport links were seen as critical for economic success, particularly high-quality infrastructure that would join up cities around the country., Between promoting domestic air, road or rail travel, the latter was seen as easily the best choice. A new, high-capacity rail line would move as many passengers as two three-lane motorways, and beat other modes of transport by running straight into city centres. The question became what kind of railway to build., Rail passenger numbers had doubled in 20 years to 1.5 billion when HS2 got the green light in 2012-13; another 15% have since squeezed on. Particularly rapid growth came on the west coast mainline, where fast trains compete for space with stopping services and freight. An upgrade of that line had already been carried out, coming in at triple the budget and causing enormous disruption over a decade of work. Meanwhile, growing congestion meant peak-hour trains were overcrowded in Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield as well as London., HS2 was intended to free up space everywhere and be the core and spine of a modern, electrified national railway. This is a track that planners hope will be used in future centuries, like the railways 21st century Britain inherited from Victorian engineers. The idea that the technology would not be the best available, or trains would run much slower than was possible, was seen as perverse., For many people, good local connections will indeed be more important than intercity travel. But Maria Machancoses, speaking for the Midlands Connect transport body, told the Lords economic affairs committee last week that the choice of local links or HS2 was a false one: in many places, they exist in tandem., Supporters of HS2 argue that plans to develop connections within the Midlands are enabled by the project. Fast trains will go to a new Birmingham Curzon Street station on a new track, freeing up capacity for New Street station to be the more efficient hub of the currently struggling regional network. Large parts of the Northern Powerhouse Rail plans are likewise contingent on HS2., The cost-benefit ratio of HS2, as calculated by the Treasury rulebook, has never been in any way compelling, starting at £2.30 back for every £1 invested; and as the bill has gone up, the calculation grows ever worse. But that analysis only captures the existing populations and markets, rather than the transformation that proponents argue HS2 will bring to the places where people live and work and the journeys they take., Economists and planners believe quick, reliable transport links spell jobs and growth. Other big infrastructure developments, such as the eastern Jubilee line in London, have had poor cost-benefit assessments (and escalating budgets) – but within 13 years of the opening of the tube line extension in 1999, the number of jobs at Canary Wharf went up fourfold to more than 100,000 as companies relocated., Towns on the route of HS1, the short existing high-speed line in Kent, have seen increased investment in businesses and homes. The promise of HS2 alone has driven signs of a rebalancing economy in Birmingham, including booming construction and the relocation of major firms such as HSBC., Although HS2 prefers to emphasise capacity rather than speed, the evidence suggests businesses, and individuals, do indeed value getting to Birmingham quicker., Passengers pay a huge premium on tickets to use faster intercity services between the Midlands and London: roughly double the fare of rival trains to save 15%-30% of the journey time., All parts north-west from Crewe would see journey times to London slashed when services are integrated in 2031; the complete HS2 network would make new connections easy – such as the north-east to the Midlands – let alone bringing Manchester to just 67 minutes from London., The city leaders along the route firmly believe regeneration will accompany the new line. Visions of transformation naturally exist for Old Oak Common (at the southern end of the development) and Birmingham, where bulldozers have already prepared the ground, and around the high-speed hubs of Manchester and Leeds; but also in places such as Darlington and Durham, where business plans are being drawn up for the knock-on effects of improved transport links., Meanwhile, according to HS2, the construction of the line itself will employ about 30,000 people at its peak., The time and money (about £7.4bn) already directly spent may be sunk costs. But cancellation might spell a long wait for better links, even in the event that the savings were indeed ringfenced for transport in the regions., To get HS2 “shovel-ready”, more than a decade has passed with extensive public consultation, parliamentary scrutiny and engineering studies carried out – including examining the kind of incremental upgrades proposed again now. A similar period of scrutiny and debate would likely await alternative schemes., HS2, even with delays, should be running high-speed services to Crewe and beyond by 2031, a timeframe that its supporters insist is unlikely to be achievable for any comparable alternative.hs2 will spark regeneration say city leaders on the route", "label": 0}, "train-105": {"text": "\nWho was the Streatham attacker and why was he imprisoned?\n, Sudesh Amman stabbed two people in south London before being shot dead by police, \nDan Sabbagh Defence and security editor, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 05.44 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 15.55 EST\n\n, Sudesh Amman, from Harrow in north-west London, was jailed in December 2018 after admitting to 13 counts of expressing his support for Islamist terrorism and possessing and sharing Islamic State and al-Qaida propaganda in a family WhatsApp group and on social media. He was 18 at the time., Amman had come to police attention in April of that year for posting extremist material and was arrested a month later. He expressed support for Isis and sent beheading videos to his girlfriend, advising her to kill her “kuffar” (unbelieving) parents., He also wrote about the desirability of conducting a terror attack: “If you can’t make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack.”, At the time of his conviction at the Old Bailey, acting Commander Alexis Boon, head of the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, said Amman had a “fascination with dying in the name of terrorism”, as seen in a notepad recovered from his home., “Amman had scrawled his ‘life goals’ in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to ‘Jannah’, the afterlife,” she said., Why was he released?, Amman’s jailing for three years and four months was a fixed-term sentence and, in common with other terrorism offenders, Amman served half of it, taking into account time he had spent on remand before the trial., He was released in January, but considered a sufficient threat to the public that he was released on what Whitehall sources said were “very stringent” licensing conditions, including a nighttime curfew plus active surveillance by undercover police., Active surveillance is reserved only for the handful of most serious cases at any one time in the UK, but it was crucial in ensuring a rapid end to Amman’s stabbing spree., Film and photographs of the attack in Streatham show Amman being apprehended and shot dead by at least two armed, plain clothes police officers within minutes of him having injured two people on the busy south London high street., Could his release have been prevented?, The exact details about Amman’s imprisonment and release are not yet clear. He appears to have been on a normal, fixed-term sentence, meaning he would be eligible for release on licence halfway through the jail term., Unless he committed further offences in prison there would be nothing to prevent his release – although he was clearly subject to a number of conditions in what turned out to be an unsuccessful attempt to prevent him being dangerous to members of the public., Why was Amman shot? Is it legal for plain clothes officers to have taken action?, Police are allowed to use “reasonable force” to prevent crime. In the case of a terrorist attack, if an officer honestly believes someone poses a threat to their life, or to the life of others, firearms can be used., The decision to shoot is the officer’s alone. For the shots to be legal, they must show they were acting in the defence of themselves or others and that their actions were proportionate. Official policy is that firearms “shoot to incapacitate” although they are trained to shoot in the chest, where it is likely the suspect will be killed., Normally, armed officers arriving at a terrorist incident would be in uniform, but because of the unusual nature of Amman’s case he was being monitored by undercover officers carrying Glock pistols, intended for their own protection., Armed officers of all types are allowed to self-deploy in an emergency situation, and are supposed to inform their targets – if possible – that they are police and may shoot.

It was the second case in just over two months of a freed prisoner committing further terror offences., On Tuesday, a government spokesman did not rule out derogating from the ECHR to try to put the new laws in place and said the legislation could be introduced in the next few days., The possible move could be the first major test of Britain’s relationship with Europe’s legal institutions on human rights following Brexit, and comes before a review the Conservative party has said it wants to carry out into the country’s human rights laws., On whether the country derogates from the ECHR, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We are going to ensure that we will bring forward the necessary legislation to protect the public because that is the right thing to do.”, Asked again if the government would deviate from ECHR rulings to bring in the fast-tracked laws, he said: “As the justice secretary said, we believe that we can bring forward this legislation and we are committed to doing so.”, In his only head-on acknowledgement of the organisation’s role in UK law, he said: “We are signatories to the ECHR.”, The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, said allowing speculation over the ECHR’s influence to continue was a ploy to give Tory party members anti-European “red meat”., The Labour peer said: “So what are we to believe in this new Trumpian politics? And what is their motive? This is red meat to their right wing.”, There are 224 terrorist offenders in prison, four of whom are due for early release in March, according to an analysis by the Henry Jackson Society thinktank., Three of those were due for automatic release and could be affected by the legislation. They include Mohammed Ghani from Barnet, north London, who in 2019 was sentenced to 28 months for four offences including threatening to kill police officers in a call to 999 and possessing the Isis propaganda magazine Inspire., Another is Mohammed Zahir Khan, a corner-shop owner from Sunderland, who was sentenced for four years and six months in May 2018 for nine counts of distributing Isis propaganda via a Twitter account and calling for “death to Shia” Muslims., The third is Mohammed Khilji from Brent, north-west London, who was jailed in June 2018 for five years on eight counts of encouraging terrorism, by sharing graphic videos of Isis beheadings and videos calling for violence against non-Muslims., Each is currently eligible for release at the halfway point of their sentence, with the time served discounted for time on remand., The human rights group Liberty said it believed that the government’s proposals were at risk of being struck down by a legal challenge, because they were in apparent breach of article 7 of the ECHR., That states “No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed.”, Martha Spurrier, the director of the pressure group, writing in the Guardian in a forthcoming comment piece, warned: “Everyone – including convicted criminals of course – has a right to serve the prison sentence they were given when they were tried by an independent judge.”, Other legal experts said that they believed that ministers would be able to see off any legal challenge. “The new provisions are likely to survive legal challenge so long as they do not change the total sentence, but just the arrangements for how it is to be served,” said Lord Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terror legislation., “The courts both in the UK and in Strasbourg and have been quite pragmatic about this in similar cases in the past,” he added., The UK can choose to depart from the ECHR in limited circumstances, specifically in times of emergency, war or “threat to life of the nation” under article 15 of the ECHR., On whether the government considers the current situation an emergency, the spokesman said: “That’s not something we have set out. We have said we believe this is a circumstance which requires emergency legislation and that is what we’re bringing forward.”, The UK derogated from article 5 of the ECHR, the right to liberty and security, during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.uk may bypass human rights convention to rush through terror laws", "label": 0}, "train-109": {"text": "Learning Welsh is anything but ‘existentially pointless’, I have enormous respect for the journalism of your columnist Zoe Williams.

The chair of the inquiry, the Rt Rev Graham James, had met the patients earlier in the day, sharing the report with them and listening to their concerns., In the hours that followed they talked about what the day meant to them and reflected on what might have happened if they had been listened to, and whether there was any chance for them now to start to close the door on many traumatic years., Debbie Douglas, who helps runs the support group Breast Friends, listed with well-practised fluency her procedures under Paterson, who in 2017 was jailed for 20 years for carrying out unnecessary surgery that left many former patients disfigured and scared for their future., “I was left with only 50% of my breast to remove a lump that was less than 2cm, I was cut from hip to hip, I had my belly button removed, I had unnecessary chemotherapy – it’s left me completely scarred,” she said., Like many of the survivors who spoke to the Guardian, Douglas was happy with the 15 recommendations made by the inquiry, many of which reflected the wishes of former patients. “It’s a milestone and it’s what we fought for,” she said. “Satisfaction is perhaps not the word … but it’s an emotional release. We have fought to be heard and we have come so far. But I can’t be satisfied because people have died, and nothing can bring them back.”, A key recommendation from the inquiry is that those deaths be looked into, and a little more than a week ago the Birmingham coroner announced she would examine the deaths of 23 breast cancer patients treated by Paterson., Alan Bridgewater lost his wife, Denise, in 2014 after a decade of care under Paterson, including a so-called “cleavage sparing mastectomy”. He said: “She was my soulmate, she was the Rolls-Royce of women to me. I’m always asking myself what would have happened if she’d had the right surgery at the right time. But her wishes were that we keep on pushing. Denise wanted to make sure no one else would suffer like her.”, Jurors at Paterson’s trial in Nottingham heard how he ruined patients’ lives with needless operations. Frances Perks had 27 biopsy cores needlessly taken from her right breast. Carole Johnson had five unnecessary operations to remove lumps, and paid for three of them herself. Marian Moran underwent a mastectomy for benign growths that were nothing more than warts. Leanne Joseph took out two loans from her family to pay for unnecessary procedures., The trial heard the cases of 10 former patients. Sarah Jane Downing, the founder of the Support Group for Paterson Patients, said she felt many more had been heard by the inquiry. In a key victory for Downing, who started the original petition calling for compensation for private patients, the inquiry recommended that the government should overhaul rules on liability in the private sector, which currently leave patients with much less protection than those seen on the NHS., When Paterson was jailed in May 2017, many of his private patients were still fighting to get compensation of any kind. The NHS’s medical negligence agency previously paid out £9.6m in damages to 212 NHS patients, but private patients were told that Paterson’s insurer, the Medical Defence Union, had said its cover was “discretionary” and had been withdrawn. Spire Healthcare, which runs Parkway and Little Aston hospitals where Paterson practised, settled some cases but argued at the time that as Paterson was not technically their employee, they were not responsible for his actions., In September 2017 about 750 victims were told they would receive £37m in compensation, with £27.2m of the funds provided by Spire Healthcare, and £10m by Paterson’s insurers and the Heart of England NHS foundation trust in Birmingham., Downing said: “Being in a room with hundreds of fellow survivors this morning was very profound, and to hear and see their stories in the report is very moving. This report has been such a long time coming, and so many people worked so hard to make sure it happened. Finally I feel hopeful that there may be real change. It is a big step in the right direction, but now the government has to listen.”, The inquiry heard from 211 of Paterson’s victims and their family members, spanning from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s. Their experiences are painstakingly detailed in 86 pages of painful testimony in the inquiry report. Patient 447 was told her cancer had returned, probably because Paterson had carried out a “cleavage-sparing mastectomy”, a dangerous procedure that left behind breast tissue. Patient 107 complained about Paterson, only to be told “just put it behind you and get on with your life”. The family of patient 508 were told by a specialist that “she would have actually lived longer if … nobody had touched her at all”., James, the inquiry chair, said Paterson’s victims were “frequently treated with disdain”. The report reveals that around 15% of patients interviewed said they had raised concerns about their care with other doctors. One said of the reaction they received: “The doctor didn’t want anything to do with me whatsoever. I rung her … and she screamed at me … She went absolutely ballistic at me, and she said ‘I can’t see you now’. She said ‘I’m busy’.”, In the Old Crown pub, friends Lyn Perrin, Elaine Diskin and Amanda Lyth said they were still struggling with how they had been taken in by the surgeon. “I thought I was a good judge of character,” said Lyth. “But we were all taken in. We had small children, a history of cancer in the family. As soon as he heard that, he was in there. He was like a bird of prey, he really was.”, Lyth was proud of the consistent efforts that many survivors have made for many years to bring Paterson to justice. “I feel we couldn’t have done any more. For me, that part of it has come to an end today. But for people who lost loved ones, the next stage is only just beginning.” Many survivors now hope that those who worked closely with the surgeon – people who they say must have known about his practices – will face hard questions., The inquiry has reported five doctors and nurses who worked with Paterson to either the General Medical Council or the Nursing and Midwifery Council. James said one matter had been reported to West Midlands police as he believed the behaviour went “beyond professional misconduct alone”., Tracey Smith, one of Paterson’s last patients, who had surgery in 2009 for a cyst that could have been treated by a prescription, said survivors were determined to make sure the inquiry’s recommendations were acted upon and any “co-conspirators” were brought to justice. “I wouldn’t say that Paterson couldn’t happen again, because if the recommendations are ignored it easily could,” she said. “We are happy with the recommendations, but we’ve got to make sure they are put in place. We might have a couple of days to rest, but then we’ll be back fighting again.”  ian paterson patients welcome milestone and vow to fight on", "label": 0}, "train-111": {"text": "\nGrenfell Tower public inquiry delayed due to witnesses' demands\n, Contractors and the client for the tower’s refurbishment want immunity from prosecution, \nRobert Booth Social affairs correspondent, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 12.45 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 14.50 EST\n\n, The Grenfell Tower public inquiry has been delayed after corporate witnesses threatened not to give evidence unless assured anything they say will not be used in criminal prosecutions against them., Hearings have been cancelled for the rest of the week so the chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, can consider a demand for the undertaking from lawyers for the architects, builders and the client on the disastrous refurbishment of the west London tower block., Survivors and the bereaved have reacted with anger to the request for protection against self-incrimination and said it “bears hallmarks of sabotage”., But Moore-Bick is widely expected to ask the attorney general to prevent “the use of evidence given by witnesses … against them in any future criminal proceedings” in order to avoid the inquiry being entirely derailed. Without the agreement, witnesses called during the examination of how Grenfell Tower came to be refurbished in such a dangerous way could simply refuse to answer questions., The decision to cancel this week’s hearings means cross-examination of Andrzej Kuszell, Bruce Sounes and Neil Crawford at the architects Studio E will be delayed. Lawyers for the corporates seeking the protection said it was necessary because detectives are investigating possible crimes ranging from breaches of the Health and Safety Act to manslaughter. However, it is unclear how detectives could be entirely restricted from following up leads generated from evidence to the inquiry., A spokesperson for the inquiry said: “A further announcement regarding the timetable will be made once the panel has issued its ruling on the application.”, The demand for protection was made last week by lawyers acting on behalf of Studio E, the cladding contractor Harley Facades, current and former employees of the main contractor Rydon, and officials at the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, which ran the tower block where 72 people died in a catastrophic fire in June 2017., Michael Mansfield QC, representing one of the groups of bereaved and survivors, told the inquiry on Monday the application was “totally without merit” and urged Moore-Bick not to endorse it. He also urged the corporates to reconsider “whether they really want to put the families through more anguish, more agony”., Stephanie Barwise QC, representing the other group, said they were neutral on whether Moore-Bick should request it, because it had been impossible to gather the views of all of their scores of clients in such a short space of time. But she said there was “utter outrage” at the request among her clients, coming as it did a few days into the start of the second phase of the inquiry., “Our clients find themselves placed in a wholly impossible position because they cannot know the nature of the evidence which will emerge and it is not possible to know how these undertakings, if given, may affect subsequent prosecutions,” she said.grenfell tower public inquiry delayed due to witnesses demands", "label": 0}, "train-112": {"text": "\nManchester Arena bomber's brother 'just as guilty', court told\n, Hashem Abedi accused of helping to plan attack that killed 22 people at Ariana Grande concert, \nNazia Parveen North of England correspondent, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 12.44 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Tue 4 Feb 2020 06.56 EST\n\n, Two brothers had a shared goal to kill and maim as many people as possible in what proved to be one of the deadliest terror attacks the UK has seen, a trial has heard., Hashem Abedi was just as guilty of murder as his brother Salman after encouraging and helping him to carry out the Manchester Arena bombing, the Old Bailey was told., Abedi is accused of helping to plan the attack and build the suicide bomb that Salman detonated at the end of a concert by the singer Ariana Grande in May 2017, killing 22 people., The 22-year-old is also accused of the attempted murder of other concertgoers who were injured but survived. Police identified nearly 1,000 victims of the attack, including 28 people who were very seriously injured, 111 others who were hospitalised and 670 who have reported psychological trauma., Opening the biggest terror trial ever held on UK soil, the prosecutor Duncan Penny QC told the jury that the shrapnel-filled homemade bomb was designed to inflict “maximum damage” when it went off shortly after at 10.30pm on 22 May 2017., Penny said Abedi was “just as responsible for this atrocity … as surely as if he had selected the target and detonated the bomb himself”., As the defendant sat impassively listening to the evidence, family members of some of those who were killed in the attack sat yards away., Penny said Abedi spent months working alongside his brother building prototype bombs until the final device was assembled., The eventual target may well have been selected by Salman alone, Penny said, but the brothers had a shared goal to “maim and injure as many people as possible by the detonation of a large homemade bomb in a public place”., Abedi is accused of obtaining the ingredients – “precursor chemicals” – for the bomb by creating fictitious online accounts and using the bank details of unsuspecting friends and family. He allegedly obtained and experimented with metal containers to make a number of prototype improvised explosive devices (IEDs)., The bombing was the “culmination of months of planning, experimentation and preparation by the two of them,” Penny said. “He is equally guilty of the attempted murder of many others and in doing so he was guilty of agreeing with his brother to cause an explosion. In acting as he did, the crown alleges that this defendant assisted and encouraged his brother to act as he did.”, He said the brothers began showing signs of radicalisation and began to plan the attack when they were living alone in their family home after their parents returned to Libya. Abedi worked at a pizza takeaway in Stockport and asked the owner if he could take empty and discarded metal vegetable oil cans and sell them for scrap., Together with his brother, Abedi is said to have duped “gullible” friends and family including their cousin Alharth Forjani into lending their Amazon accounts to buy chemicals. They obtained a separate postal address from an acquaintance in the Libyan community in Manchester to have other chemicals delivered, the court heard., The brothers’ cover story was that they needed to refill a large electric battery at the family home in Libya that was used to power a generator, and – a “variation on the theme” – that they were topping up a leaking car battery., The eventual device was manufactured from a mixture that included hydrogen peroxide and sulphuric acid, which were “readily available to buy from wholesalers and on the internet”. The bomb was packed with shrapnel including nuts, cross dowels and screws, and the detonator casing was fashioned from old vegetable oil cans., On the night of the concert, in anticipation of the expected audience profile being younger than normal, staff at the arena were advised to ensure that people dropping off young fans for the show had a phone number by which to contact them at the end of the night., The City Room, where Salman detonated the bomb, was a foyer area that acted as a point for parents and family to collect young concertgoers. It was said to be a “natural assembly point within the complex for people to gather at the conclusion of the concert in order to meet up with or to collect their loved ones”, and at the time was heavily congested with people., “In the midst of these people, carrying a heavy rucksack that contained a homemade bomb, was Salman Abedi,” Penny said., Of the 22 casualties, 19 died at the scene and another three were treated by members of the public and the emergency services but “sadly succumbed to their injuries shortly thereafter”., After the bombing, police identified a series of addresses in Manchester that the brothers had used to receive deliveries, construct prototypes, store materials, and manufacture explosives, the court heard. A 7cm piece of twisted metal from a cans, labelled “Can F”, was found in some green fabric at the music venue., The court heard Abedi had studied electrical installation and documents discovered at his home later revealed he also had a basic knowledge of electrical circuitry., Abedi claims he had nothing to do with making the bomb and had “no inkling” of his brother’s radicalisation, believing that Salman had acquired the chemicals for “family reasons rather than terrorist ones”., But the prosecution alleges his fingerprints were found on a number of significant items that suggest he was involved in the bombing, including pieces of metal tightly rolled into improvised cylinders. His fingerprints and DNA were found at a rented flat where traces of the homemade explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP) were also discovered, Penny said., “The crown’s case is that this defendant was well aware of what he was doing. This was no idling away the hours in the garden shed whilst smoking, as the defendant was later to tell police. Rather he was handling these items for a specific purpose, the very same purpose which lay behind his other actions,” said Penny., Abedi, who is of Libyan heritage, denies all of the charges against him.

At the moment, for tax purposes, the younger person is essentially considered the wife and the older the husband., Susie Pinel, the a Treasury minister on Jersey, said: “This will give equal rights to both spouses and civil partners under Jersey’s tax law. It will remove the archaic presumption in the current law that a wife’s income is deemed to belong to her husband., “It brings to an end an outdated system that treats married women and younger spouses in same-sex relationships unfairly.”, During a debate on the issue at the States Assembly on Tuesday, Pinel said the anomaly dated back to 1928 when income tax was introduced on Jersey., The minister added that when civil partnerships and same-sex marriages were introduced there was no time to reform the tax laws., Instead the law assumed that the older partner would take the place of “the husband” and the younger “the wife”. Pinel said this could be seen as discriminatory and offensive and possibly open to legal challenge., She said the change will convert “so-called married man’s taxation” into couple’s taxation – and was a stepping stone towards the introduction of independent taxation., There have been concerns from bodies including Citizens Advice Jersey that the move could lead to a bigger tax bill for some couples. The Jersey Chamber of Commerce expressed concern that it would make the spouse/civil partner liable for the debt of the other party., Pinel said: “To be clear, my proposition has no negative financial impact on any couple. It simply brings to an end an outdated system that treats married women and younger spouses in same-sex relationships unfairly., “A very small number of commentators have raised concerns over making a couple jointly liable for the payment of any outstanding taxes that they may owe. But with equal rights come equal responsibilities and we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place in the event of financial hardship.”, Sam Mézec, a Jersey senator, said the change was “well overdue”. He added: “It’s simply wrong that in the year 2020 our tax law erases the identity of married women. It’s the stuff of medieval times, not the modern age. This ends that injustice. It puts us where we ought to have been for decades.”, Not all members were enthusiastic supporters. Senator Kristina Moore said she backed greater equality but claimed this “stepping stone” measure muddied the waters., Concern was also expressed during the debate that a person could suddenly desert a family, leaving their partner facing a tax bill. The prospect of a coercive man or woman manipulating a partner by threatening them with the prospect of being liable for tax debts was also raised., But the proposal won the backing of 40 members, with two against and two abstentions., Jersey is not part of the UK but is a self-governing dependency with its own directly elected legislative assemblies, administrative, fiscal and legal systems and its own courts of law. , jersey scraps only husbands talk tax rule", "label": 0}, "train-114": {"text": "\nKelly-Anne Case: 'sadistic' killer jailed for at least 30 years\n, Brendan Rowan-Davies, 29, jailed for murdering 27-year-old in Gosport last July , \nSteven Morris and agency, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 11.36 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Tue 4 Feb 2020 08.28 EST\n\n, A man who tortured a woman before slitting her throat has been jailed for a minimum of 30 years after being convicted of murder and arson., Brendan Rowan-Davies, 29, tied up 27-year-old Kelly-Anne Case at her home in Gosport, Hampshire, then killed her and set fire to her flat. Firefighters found Case’s naked body on her bed., The defendant shook his head as the jury returned its verdicts at Winchester crown court while gasps and cries of “yes” could be heard from the public gallery., Sentencing Rowan-Davies to life, the judge, Mr Justice Garnham said the murder had a “sexual sadistic motive” and added: “She was vulnerable and defenceless. She was completely at your mercy and you showed her none.”, Case’s mother, Caroline Tebb, said in a statement read to court that her daughter was “brutally and sadistically taken by a sick, vile excuse of a human being”., She added: “This oxygen thief has not only deprived me of a daughter but he also took a mother, a sister, an aunt, cousin, granddaughter and friend. Kelly was an attractive, young, straight-talking, independent woman. She will be sadly missed by those who truly knew her.”, William Mousley QC, prosecuting, had told the jury the motive for the attack appeared to be sexual and the defendant had mutilated Case’s body after killing her., He said the blaze was reported to the emergency services at 8.30am on 30 July last year. Firefighters found fires had been set in the kitchen and living room of the property before discovering the body in the rear bedroom., Mousley said the victim had been “alone and vulnerable” when she was killed. , He said a postmortem showed her throat had been cut several times, which would have caused catastrophic blood loss., She had eight shallow wounds above the collarbone, a 9cm stab wound to the back of the right shoulder and another 2cm wound., Mousley said: “These have the appearance of someone wanting to control or coerce or terrify Kelly-Anne, so perhaps she would do what she was being told.”, He said she had also sustained rib fractures that were consistent with CPR. Mousley said: “It could be that the killer did that at some point – if that was a change of heart it came too late after a savage attack.”, Mousley said the defendant had visited Case with a friend, Will Vallender, who was in a sexual relationship with her, during the previous night when they allegedly drank and took cocaine., He said during the night Rowan-Davies told Case he had “always fancied her”. She laughed it off as a joke before later going to have sex with Vallender in her bedroom., Mousley said the pair left at 6.25am but the defendant was seen to return to Case’s home about an hour later when he murdered her., In the witness box, Rowan-Davies told a court he filmed her having sex with his friend but denied murdering her., The defendant said he left Case’s home with Vallender but later returned alone because he had left his tobacco at her home., He said that when he went inside and upstairs at the house, a person put a knife to his throat from behind and he saw Kelly dead on her bed with an injury to her throat., Following the sentencing, senior investigating officer DI Toby Elcock said: “This was a horrific and planned attack on a young woman, and our thoughts remain with Ms Case’s children, friends and family.”kelly anne case man convicted of savage", "label": 0}, "train-115": {"text": "\nBristol declares ecological emergency over loss of wildlife\n, Mayor calls for urgent response to declines in birds, bees and mammals such as hedgehogs, \nSteven Morris, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 11.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 14.40 EST\n\n, The local decline of many birds, insects and some mammals has prompted Bristol to declare an ecological emergency., The mayor, Marvin Rees, and leaders from local organisations and attractions met on a hill in the city on Tuesday to make the declaration., The city council said some bird species such as swifts and starlings had almost entirely vanished from Bristol. As in many cities and towns across the UK, there have also been worrying losses of bees and other insects, as well as mammals including hedgehogs and bats., Two years ago Bristol became the first UK authority to declare a climate emergency. Over the next few months a plan will be developed to tackle the ecological emergency, and the hope is that the eye-catching announcement will prompt organisations to take action., Rees said: “It is not too late to start the recovery of our wildlife. We must work together to grasp this last chance and put things right for nature and wildlife in our city. This declaration will provide a focus for the whole city to come together and take positive action., “Our commitment to this will extend beyond parks and green spaces. We need our buildings, streets and open spaces to support wildlife and create a more nature-friendly city, and we need new developments to do the same.”, Priorities will include looking at ways to prevent wildlife habitats from being destroyed, and creating and caring for wildlife-rich spaces in every part of the city., Organisations represented at the declaration included a hospital trust, an NHS commissioning group, a university, Bristol zoo, the science and arts centre We The Curious, and the SS Great Britain., Ian Barrett, the chief executive of Avon Wildlife Trust, said the climate and ecological emergencies were being felt everywhere. , “We can’t wait for national governments or international bodies to lead the way, we have to show that through collective action we can make Bristol a city where wildlife can thrive and the natural world can flourish,” he said. “This is about stopping the loss forever of much-loved species which were once common in gardens, parks, waterside and green spaces across the city – swifts, starlings, hedgehogs and butterflies.”, Carla Denyer, a Green councillor in Bristol, said: “Just as we know there are things we can do now to tackle the climate emergency without the need to set up new boards and committees to commission lengthy studies, so also we know that there are things we can do right now to tackle the ecological emergency., “One of those is rewilding – recreating areas of natural habitat for plants and animals that are important to a balanced ecosystem. In Bristol that might mean areas of our parks are less manicured, but it also means repurposing road verges and maybe even bus stop roofs.”, Some green campaigners have criticised the council for not opposing plans to expand Bristol airport.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic., According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment., About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill.

In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person.

In the case of Sudesh Amman, he spent just over a year and was released automatically at the midway point of his sentence., The full custodial term handed down to any offender cannot be retrospectively altered – although the government announced on Monday that it would attempt to retrospectively change the point at which they can be released, a change likely to affect roughly 200 terrorists currently in prison and be subject to legal challenge., Therefore such a move does not address issues specific to offenders like Usman Khan, who killed two people on London Bridge last year, and Amman, both of whom had served time in jail for terror offences., To break the cycle, many have argued it is time for the government to put some time, energy and resources into what happens inside prison, as well as how long offenders should be locked up. No matter when an individual is released, and with the exception of a limited number of the most serious cases, they are all going to have to be released eventually., Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor in the north-west, said without an effective rehabilitation process, delaying release of a prisoner is just delaying an inevitable attack., “Yes, a longer sentence, we could have delayed this inevitable crime by a few months, if we’d given him that,” he told BBC Radio 4. “But there is a real problem with deradicalisation and disengagement programmes. They have been largely underfunded. They are poorly executed. This is all down to the impact of austerity on the probation service.”, He added: “There’s no formal mechanism to risk assess them, they will commit this crime unless there something is done about this in the prison. Yes, longer sentences will have an impact but it just delays the inevitable.”, Currently, the main deradicalisation programme in prisons is called the healthy identity intervention (HII), which delivers one-to-one individually tailored sessions. But ultimately it is experimental. The Ministry of Justice completed a “process evaluation” when it was piloted and found it was well received by facilitators and participants but its success will not be determined for two more years., While its HII’s success is yet to be formally determined, the delivery of such programmes comes against a backdrop of brutal 40% cuts to the Ministry of Justice, and therefore the prison and probation services for which the department is responsible, over the last 10 years., And what we do know is convicted terrorists are having to be put on waiting lists for the HII programme. Prof Andrew Silke, who has studied efforts to deradicalise those jailed for terrorism offences, told the Guardian some prisoners who have said they are willing, never get on the programme before their release., We also know that the first ever terrorist act committed within prison walls happened last month. Four officers and a nurse were injured at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire, on Thursday. One of the attackers is understood to be Brusthom Ziamani, who was guilty of preparing an act of terrorism in 2015., The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall, has warned that for some, prison “may also provide a perfectly receptive and captive audience for recruitment”., “Prison does not affect all individuals equally and it may well be that for some individuals prison increases their status in the network and prolongs their activism,” he said in a speech to the Henry Jackson Society last month., “It may also provide a perfectly receptive and captive audience for recruitment.”, He added: “That doesn’t mean that prison is not the right remedy, but its consequences must be addressed, including, as the recent HMP Whitemoor attacks show, recognising that terrorism offending does not stop at the prison door and there is no automatic ‘job done’ when a terrorist is behind bars.”, In fact, a judge last week told a vulnerable man who had been convicted of encouraging far-right terror attacks he would be “liable to radicalisation” inside jail that could increase the risk he poses and sentenced him to a community sentence., A former prison governor and Whitehall official, Ian Acheson, was commissioned by then justice secretary Michael Gove, to review radicalisation in prisons and come up with some practical solutions. The main recommendation was to develop a network of high-security separation centres – quickly dubbed “jihadi jails” – to remove hardliners from the mainstream prison population and to limit the spread of radicalisation., But a recent assessment suggested a perfunctory implementation of the proposals. Staff at two of the three separation centres told MoJ researchers that referral rates to the units were too low. Frankland prison and Full Sutton prison each have the capacity to hold eight prisoners, but between June 2017 and December 2018 were holding only three to six prisoners on average. A third facility at Woodhill prison is reportedly empty., The Ministry of Justice previously estimated that about 700 to 1,000 prisoners are considered a risk owing to their extremist views and as of 31 March 2019 there were 223 people in custody in Britain for terrorism-related offences., Acheson told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he remained “concerned” about the prison service’s ability to manage terrorist offenders., He said: “I am still unconvinced that the prison service itself has the aptitude or the attitude to assertively manage terrorist offenders.”, The prime minister, Boris Johnson, told reporters on Monday that while deradicalisation could work, there had been few successes. This might be accurate in the UK, but worldwide there are examples of effective practice., Belgium had the highest European levels of foreign terrorist fighters travelling to the Syria and Iraq conflict, which led to the country developing its own approach to violent extremism and preventing radicalisation., Primarily, it is the regional and local levels that focus on prevention and resilience-building. The city of Vilvoorde has drawn frequent praise for its innovative and hands-on response to radicalisation and violent extremism., Denmark has developed a programme that focuses on reintegration of foreign fighters, rather than terrorist prisoners, but its principles are worth noting with its focus on reintegration, rather than punishment., In an interview with the Guardian, Supt Allan Aarslev, who is in charge of the police end of the programme in his city of Aarhus, said: “What’s easy is to pass tough new laws. Harder is to go through a real process with individuals: a panel of experts, counselling, healthcare, assistance getting back into education, with employment, maybe accommodation. With returning to everyday life and society. We don’t do this out of political conviction; we do it because we think it works.”terror attacks show britain needs new ideas on deradicalisation", "label": 0}, "train-120": {"text": "\nHS2's northern critics: 'We don't need it but we'll be paying for it'\n, \nHS2's northern critics: 'We don't need it but we'll be paying for it'\n, In the north of England, the arguments over whether to push on with the HS2 project are as polarised as they are in Westminster.

Forget USB ports or wifi. Justthe basics – and some dignity., Few would put at the top of their list a £100bn-plus railway that will get them to London an hour quicker., A recent YouGov poll found that 35% of respondents in the north were in support of HS2, while 41% opposed the scheme., Potential emissions, Construction:, • Huge quantities of steel and concrete including concrete slab-track, • Moving construction materials to site, • Tunnelling (more carbon-intensive than open-air construction), • Construction machines, • Removing soil by truck, • Manufacture of rolling stock, • Journey to work of HS2 employees, Operation:, • Power source not guaranteed to be renewable. Speed of HS2 requires more power, • Ongoing maintenance, • Increased car journeys to HS2 stations, • HS2’s better airport connections could increase flying, • Domestic flights reduced by HS2 could lead to increase in international routes, Potential savings, • Increased rail capacity shifts freight from road to rail, • Increased capacity leads to more local/regional rail journeys, • Modal shift with travellers choosing rail over more carbon-emitting road, • Travellers also switching from flying to high-speed rail, • Carbon sequestration from tree-planting, • HS2 could be powered by all-renewable energy, • HS2 prevents other carbon-intensive infrastructure projects, Sources:, HS2 Limited, 2019, High Speed Two phase 2a, Informationa Paper, E27: carbon, Friends of the Earth, Opportunity Costs of HS2, 2019, Lord Berkeley’s Dissenting Report, 2020, Size of emissions not included because different scenarios give different estimates; figures have not been modelled for all these factors, For people like David Whittle, 77, a retired coach driver from Leigh, Greater Manchester, it’s hard to comprehend what the benefits to the average person would be. “What am I going to be using HS2 for? It’s for business people. We’re packed in like sardines on the local buses and trains we take every day,” he said., The town fell to the Tories last December, and its newly appointed representative James Grundy is one of 21 Conservative MPs who have formed an HS2 review group calling for the project to be shelved in favour of local investment. Although Leigh constituents will be able to bus to the nearest stop, in Wigan, within 35 minutes, Grundy argues the money would be better spent on improving inadequate local links., Since its train station closed in 1969, Leigh has not even had the luxury of bemoaning poor rail services, something that Grundy – like his pro-HS2 predecessor Andy Burnham, who was the town’s MP until 2017 – wants to be reinstated., It takes a little over half an hour by car to get from Leigh into Manchester city centre, where many residents work. But the journey time is almost double by bus, despite the instatement of a swanky new guided bus service. As Grundy put it in a YouTube video posted by the HS2 review group: “We don’t need HS2 in our constituency, but we will all be paying for it.”, The perceived disadvantages of the project for the north go beyond the lack of investment in local transport. Some, like Andy Carter, the Conservative MP for Warrington South, believe that if the government really did want to “level up” the economy, it should prioritise a project to link up the region itself., In a recent interview with the BBC, Carter noted that northerners were more likely to benefit from improved trains across the north than to London, because most people used them more frequently., “When I travel on the train, and I get on at Warrington Bank Quay and I see maybe 50 or 100 people getting on the train to go to London, then I go to Warrington Central and see the maybe 200 or 300 who can’t get on the trains because they’re full, that’s where we need to put our focus,” he said., The current design of the proposed £39bn Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) – which would make travel within the region itself easier – integrates 50% of HS2 lines., High Speed Two Ltd is set up by the Labour government to examine possibilities for increasing high-speed rail capacity in the UK., The project is split into two phases - London to Birmingham forms phase one, with phase two extending the route to Manchester and Leeds., The transport secretary, Conservative Justine Greening, announces the decision to build HS2., A judicial review is called into the HS2 decision., Lord Justice Ouseley upholds one of the 10 grounds for complaint about HS2 in the judicial review – the claim that the government had acted unfairly and unlawfully when consulting on compensation for homeowners affected by the route., The Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, describes the project as \"absolutely vital\" as MPs approve funding. The high-speed rail (London-West Midlands) bill is formally introduced in parliament., After freedom of information requests, a 2012 Department for Transport viability report into HS2 is released, revealing the department considered it unaffordable., Allan Cook replaces Sir Terry Morgan as chair of HS2, after the latter fails to deliver the opening of the Crossrail project in London on schedule., A report from the New Economics Foundation suggests HS2 will deliver the most benefit to London, and exacerbate regional inequality., A fresh government review begins into HS2 into whether the scheme should be approved, amended or scrapped entirely., The Conservative transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announces that full HS2 services between London and Birmingham will be delayed by up to five years to 2031, and that the final completion of the northern section of the high-speed rail network would likely be delayed by seven years until 2040. He also confirmed the budget had escalated from the official £56bn at 2015 prices to up to £88bn at today’s prices., After a period of review, prime minister Boris Johnson announces that HS2 will go ahead, alongside a package of measures aimed at improving bus and cycling links outside of London., While it is unanimously accepted that better connectivity within the north is a matter of urgency, leaders including Burnham, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, Steve Rotheram, and Leeds city council’s leader, Judith Blake, accept the certainty that NPR could not be delivered without HS2., But outside of the cities, leaders including Rotherham’s Labour council leader, Chris Read, hold the belief that while the costs would go up for NPR if HS2 was scrapped, the supposed co-dependence of the projects is a convenient scapegoat., “It doesn’t make sense to me. The first thing people would need and want is better train connections in and out of the cities of the north and the ability to be able to move between them more easily,” said Read., Read, who also dismisses Network Rail’s argument that the new high-speed rail line would free up capacity on existing lines in the north, is instead concerned it would only increase the burden on South Yorkshire stations such as Rotherham., After Sheffield city council lobbied against a proposal for a new HS2 station at the Meadowhall shopping centre in favour of it stopping in the city centre, planners opted for a cheaper option of a “spur” line that will use the existing station., A lack of capacity at Sheffield, said Read, could have a knock-on effect on Rotherham’s already poor services which, he added, were vital to the town’s commuters., “It’s absolutely critical for places like Rotherham that you do have easy connectivity into those hubs,” said Read. “Rotherham I suspect is quite classic of a northern town. People’s lives now involve them moving around more.”, He added: “The world doesn’t stop halfway down the Sheffield parkway, we expect people to move around. We need the public transport infrastructure to enable people to do that.”, • This article was amended on 5 February 2020. An earlier version misdescribed Steve Rotheram as “Liverpool’s mayor”.

Helen Pidd speaks to those in favour, \nHelen Pidd North of England editor, \n\nTue 4 Feb 2020 02.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 4 Feb 2020 10.20 EST\n\n, One of the most popular arguments against HS2 is that billions would be better spent on a new Transpennine rail line called Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), as well as local transport upgrades – if the government’s goal is to “level up” the country and close the gap between London and everywhere else., It is an idea Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, might be expected to back – not least because Liverpool was snubbed by HS2 and yet would be properly plugged into NPR, creating a crucial freight route between the ports of Liverpool and Hull. Currently it is quicker to get the train from London to Paris than between those two maritime cities (2hr 16min versus 2hr 37min with one change)., But Rotheram insists you cannot have one without the other. Not only would NPR use 50 miles (80km) of HS2 track, including a costly tunnel from Manchester airport to an upgraded Manchester Piccadilly station, but its whole economic case relies on a substantial piggyback from HS2 and its links to the south. It is also at least six years from being “shovel-ready”, unlike the London to Birmingham phase of HS2, with the painful process of negotiating with landowners and environmentalists still to come., “Our business case shows quite clearly that if we were to get HS2, Northern Powerhouse Rail is a far more attractive proposition to put to the Treasury,” said Rotheram. He believes HS2 has been mis-sold to the public on speed rather than capacity: “It was all couched very poorly … The people I speak to, ordinary people if you like, not politicians, they go, ‘But I’m not interested in getting to London 20 minutes early’.”, Not only is that wrong – they would arrive at Euston 40 minutes earlier than today– but an undersold benefit to “ordinary” people in the north of England is that fast intercity services to London and Birmingham will be removed from the existing mainlines, freeing up space for far more local stopping services, as well as freight., To understand how dysfunctional the north’s railways are, Winsford provides a good example. About 33,000 people live in this working-class Cheshire town, built on top of a huge salt mine that provides 50% of the grit used on UK roads each winter. Situated right on the west coast mainline, the busiest mixed-use railway in Europe, Winsford is approximately 30 miles from both Manchester and Liverpool., But there are no direct trains to Manchester from Winsford. And even during the morning rush-hour there are just two services you would realistically take to get to work for 9am in Liverpool. For most of the day there is one solitary train in each direction per hour – and that’s if they turn up (15% of trains from Winsford were cancelled last month). Compare that with Twyford, a village in Berkshire that has a population of 7,000 but has nine trains between 7am and 8am to take commuters 30 miles into London., But Winsford is not a ghost station. Holding a conversation is difficult on either of the two platforms because so many trains pass through. Fifteen whoosh by without stopping each day between 7am and 8am, one every four minutes, including fast services between Scotland and London or Birmingham along the west coast mainline. Some of these would almost certainly transfer to HS2 – which is set to cut through fields to the east of Winsford, prompting consternation about the stability of the salt mines below – were it built in full., There are at least 100 stations across the north and Midlands that would benefit from released capacity, according to Network Rail, which owns and manages Britain’s railways., The real winners from HS2 would be passengers on local services, according to Gareth Dennis, a writer and railway engineer who has worked on Crossrail and the Midland Mainline electrification. “Arguably they are the people who will notice it most,” he said. “The main benefit for HS2 is not on HS2 but very much about the existing railway network, particularly around Leeds and Manchester but also through the East Midlands and Birmingham.”, Britain’s railway network is a “jack-of-all-trades and a master of none”, Dennis argues, with 125mph intercity trains sharing the same track as Pacer trains, the much-derided “buses on rails” that screech along at half that speed on a good day., Keith Swindell travels from Winsford to Liverpool each working day. He is so used to delays that the email address he contacts most often is West Midlands Railway’s refund department, he said, as he waited for the delayed 7.42am to Liverpool Lime Street one morning last week. “If I’m standing on a platform waiting with nothing better to do I might as well fill in another claim form.”, Alisha Nixon, a 30-year-old sales manager, has been suffering the Liverpool service for the last six months after moving back in with her parents in Winsford to save for a deposit on a house. “If it makes the railway better, I’m all for HS2 because at the moment trains are constantly getting cancelled,” she said. “The trains going through to London do sometimes hold the other trains up.” She drives a few times a week but said she would leave the car at home more often if the service was more regular., If the north of England is to thrive, particularly outside the major cities, public transport must be drastically improved, argues Philip Cox, the chief executive of the Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership. Only 2% of journeys in his region are by rail and the same proportion by bus, he said, which is a worry, given fewer young people than ever are learning to drive. According to government research, the number of 20- to 29-year-olds with driving licences dropped to 63% in 2014, from 75% in 1994., “From our perspective, if that carries through the age range … then unless we put decent public transport in place as an economy we are going to be in some trouble, because anyone who thinks about living and working here can’t, because they don’t drive,” he said.northern powerhouse rail backers say hs2 vital success", "label": 0}, "train-122": {"text": "\nStuart Lubbock's father tells Michael Barrymore to 'come clean' over death\n, Terry Lubbock believes entertainer has not told police everything he knows about his son’s death in 2001, PA Media, \n\nMon 3 Feb 2020 19.01 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 3 Feb 2020 19.06 EST\n\n, The father of a man found dead in Michael Barrymore’s swimming pool has said he believes the entertainer knows more than he has revealed., Terry Lubbock, 74, called for the TV presenter to “clear your name” as Essex police and Crimestoppers offered a £20,000 reward for information., His son Stuart Lubbock, 31, was found dead at Barrymore’s then home in Roydon, Essex on March 31 2001, after a party with five other men and three women., Det Ch Ins Stephen Jennings told reporters at a press conference at Essex police headquarters in Chelmsford: “I believe that he was raped and murdered that night … One or more of those partygoers are responsible for that serious sexual assault on Stuart.”, He said three people arrested in connection with the death – which included Barrymore – had not been “completely eliminated” from inquiries, while the five other people were still being treated as witnesses., The officer admitted mistakes were made in the initial investigation after items possibly used in the attack – including a pool thermometer and a doorhandle – vanished from the crime scene., But he said he was now confident that the force would find the killer and finally secure a conviction, hoping that the reward and a new documentary will generate new leads after 19 years., “We know not everyone at that party was responsible for what happened, but someone was. We also know that not everyone at that party may know what happened, but someone does,” he said., “We want the people who do have information to come forward and talk to us. Nineteen years is a long time, loyalties change, and it is never too late to do the right thing. Some people also arrived at the scene in the hours after Stuart’s death. They may hold the key information and we would like to hear from them., “It is also possible that individuals at the party may have told other people what happened that night.”, Lubbock is also confident that his son’s killer will finally be found, and thinks Barrymore could help. “I think it’s time he comes clean,” he said. “It’s time now, Michael. I think you know more about this than you have said., “It’s time now for you to either clear your name or put your hands up to what happened, because you must know.”, His comments come ahead of a new programme charting the police’s investigation into the death: Barrymore: The Body in the Pool, to be aired on Channel 4 on Thursday. The documentary tells the story of the death through interviews with journalists, forensics experts and people who knew Stuart., At the beginning of the 90-minute programme, the 999 call reporting the incident to police is played. The caller says: “A fella has drowned in the pool. We have got him out. There’s a party going on and someone has just gone out and found him. I think the geezer’s dead, mate.”, Last year Barrymore spoke about the death, telling Piers Morgan’s ITV show Life Stories that he “couldn’t be more sorry” for his behaviour that night, and that he is “100% innocent”., He was arrested in 2007 but never charged with any offence., He sued Essex police, claiming that his arrest was wrongful and had cost him about £2.5m in lost earnings.

Mr Kuffar non-believers prepare for real war,” he wrote in January 2017. Another said “death to shias … death to every single one of them”., After a trial in May 2018, Khan, then aged 40, was found guilty of terrorist offences and encouraging religious hatred, and was sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court. At the time police said: “Khan openly disseminated material over the internet that promoted terrorism and hatred of others.”, The emergency legislation comes following a terrorist attack in Streatham, south London on Sunday. Sudesh Amman, 20, was killed by police after he stabbed two people just days after being automatically released from prison for charges of disseminating terrorist material., A Whitehall official said the legislation would be introduced in the Commons on 11 February., As the government now has a stable majority, the legislation should pass all its stages in the Commons before MPs break for recess next Thursday. It will begin its passage through the House of Lords on 25 February and the government hopes to get royal assent two days later., The official said: “There are no terrorist offenders who are due to receive automatic release before that date., “If the legislation is passed by 27 February we can prevent the automatic release of any further terrorist suspects who might pose a threat to the public. This is emergency legislation which we believe is vital for protecting the public and we are sure the Lords will wish to carry out its scrutiny quickly.”, They added: “We cannot continue to be in a position where the state has no power to block the release of terrorists who continue to pose a threat to the public.”, As well as Zahir Khan, five more offenders on the same type of sentence are set to be freed in March, official sources said, slightly higher than estimates made earlier in the week by the Henry Jackson Society., The government said it was not aiming to retrospectively alter the sentence handed out by the court; this is a change to release arrangements that technically come under the administration of a sentence., “It would be our position you can change those without being considered to breach an offender’s human rights,” the official said., Diane Abbott, shadow home secretary, said Labour was awaiting the detail of the legislation but would be likely to support it, so long as the government “confine themselves to the way they administer the sentence” rather than seeking to change them retrospectively., “Bringing in the parole board to scrutinise decisions about early release is a good idea,” she added. However, Abbott said any attempt by the government to seek a derogation from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) would be a “red line” for Labour., Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson, said: “Rushing through knee-jerk legislation in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack, without the resource and plans to reduce reoffending on release, is not the way to prevent terrorism., “If the Conservatives plan to pass this new law in less than three weeks, it must publish it immediately so MPs can scrutinise it.”, There has been concern from legal experts that the government’s proposals could clash with the ECHR., Matt Hancock, the health secretary, raised further questions over Britain’s relationship with the ECHR. When asked what he made of the warnings, he said he had heard the arguments from those against the changes but that they should go ahead., Lawyers think prisoners could try to appeal against the proposed changes as the ECHR contains guidelines on retrospective changes to prison sentences.,  Hancock told Sky News: “Often in government you get a point where you have to balance the rights of different people and in this case it’s weighing up the rights of an individual who’s committed terrorist offences and his right to leave prison early against the rights of people to walk around Streatham or anywhere in our country free from the threat of terrorism.”, The convention is enforced by the European court of human rights, an institution that is separate to the EU and to which Britain remains a member and is bound by its rules. terror sentencing laws could be brought in by the end of february", "label": 0}, "train-124": {"text": "\nTrial of rapper Loski collapses as prosecutor falls ill\n, Date for retrail of the musician, real name Jyrelle O’Connor, will be decided on Friday, \nDiane Taylor, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 15.00 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 15.02 EST\n\n, The trial of one of the UK’s top rappers has collapsed before he was due to be cross-examined in court., The rapper Loski, 20, whose real name is Jyrelle O’Connor, has had a string of successful singles and attracts millions of views on YouTube and other social media platforms. , He has been charged with various offences related to possession of a firearm, one with intent to endanger life, and possession of ammunition.

That’s why it’s so important to get this sorted out, and it’s made more urgent because of the charter flight.”, The government says all those scheduled to fly are criminals with no right to remain in the country. But activists say the flight will carry dozens of people who have lived in the UK since they were children and have strong cases to continue their lives here., However, with those in detention unable to easily contact the outside world, many are effectively prevented from preparing legal challenges to their deportations. Removal flights to Ghana, Nigeria and France have already gone ahead during the period in which detainees have had limited access to the outside world., On Wednesday, MPs joined migration activists in calling on the Home Office to halt the Jamaica flight, only the second to the country since the wrongful deportation of Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean was exposed by the Guardian., Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East, said at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday afternoon: “It’s been two years since the Windrush scandal exposed the wrongful detention and deportation of Commonwealth citizens. While we wait for the much-delayed publication of the Lessons Learned review, the government plans to deport 50 people to Jamaica by charter flight next week., “Will the prime minister immediately suspend the flight until the Lessons Learned review is published and the recommendations implemented?”, At about the same time, her Labour colleague David Lammy, MP for Tottenham, warned in a tweet that without taking into account the outcome of the review, the home secretary could not be sure she was not making the same mistakes., The Home Office should not be chartering deportation flights to Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean before the much-delayed Windrush Lessons Learned Review has been published. How can the Home Secretary be sure she is not making the same mistakes? #PMQs, After a controversial deportation flight last February, Jamaican diplomats said they would not cooperate with further deportations until the review was published., The Jamaican high commissioner, Seth Ramocan, called for a suspension of deportations to Jamaica until Wendy Williams’ report had been published., Ramocan met relatives of people who were deported that February and said he was particularly concerned about the deportation of people who had lived in the UK since they were children, and also the removal of parents who had young children in Britain. , He described the stories he heard from families as “heart-rending” and said he was concerned about the “dignity and the human rights of the individuals earmarked for deportation”., But Ramocan said last night that that it was not possible under international law to refuse to accept people being deported back to Jamaica by the UK authorities, and that the Home Office had promised that no one on the flight was from the Windrush generation., The importance of his commitment last year was, he said, “to ensure that no one belonging to the Windrush generation is included in any form of deportation out of the UK. We have been assured by the British authorities that there is no such person involved. We have said that our compliance is dependent on being sure that there is absolutely no one being deported who could be part of the Windrush group.”, He said he had been told that those being deported had been convicted of drugs and violence offences. “We have been told they have committed extremely dangerous criminal activity, and not only that but repeat crimes,” Ramocan said., The immigration lawyer Jacqueline McKenzie, of McKenzie Beute and Pope, who was involved in challenging last year’s deportation flight to Jamaica, said that she was concerned that the government was going ahead with another large-scale deportation before the publication of the Windrush Lessons Learned review, which was commissioned in 2018 by the former home secretary Sajid Javid. Although a draft of this independent review was completed and leaked last summer, it has still not been published., McKenzie was uneasy about the categorisation of all those who were listed for deportation as serious criminals because similar statements had been made last year, when a number of those deported turned out to have relatively minor convictions, including a young man sentenced for a dangerous driving offence. , She said she had asked the Jamaican High Commission for the ages of those due to be deported and the length of time they had been in the UK, so she could assess whether they might come to be classified as Windrush victims., Among those due for transportation to Jamaica is a man who has lived in the UK since he was seven, and another who has lived here since he was 13. Both have families with children in the UK, said activists from Movement for Justice, which campaigns for the rights of migrants., Dawn Butler, the MP for Brent Central, raised the case of one man set for removal who was convicted for assault under the highly controversial, and since abandoned, principle of joint enterprise. “He was released after two months and his wife feels that this stress is going to kill her husband because he has a heart problem,” Butler said., A Home Office spokesperson said: “The planned charter flight to Jamaica is specifically for removing foreign criminals. Those detained for removal include people convicted of manslaughter, rape, violent crime and dealing class A drugs.”home office told to act as detainees unable to contact lawyers", "label": 0}, "train-126": {"text": "\nPolice uncovering 'epidemic of child abuse' in 1970s and 80s\n, PM told to say sorry for remark about ‘spaffing’ money up wall as 4,024 claims lead to guilty verdicts, \nVikram Dodd Police and crime correspondent, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 14.39 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 08.04 EST\n\n, Police say they are uncovering a hidden “epidemic” of paedophile abuse in the 1970s and 1980s, with thousands of allegations leading to convictions against people who abused their power to attack children., New figures seen by the Guardian show that 4,024 allegations led to guilty verdicts at court after police investigations since 2014 into decades-old child sex offences., Officers say hundreds of offenders, including teachers, religious workers, youth and care workers, thought they had got away with their crimes. Many victims have been traumatised, and some have killed themselves or been left with severe mental health problems., Police believe the figures, which show that 35% of all allegations led to guilty verdicts, demonstrate that inquiries into non-recent sexual abuse are not “spaffing money up the wall”, as Boris Johnson last year claimed. Labour said Johnson should apologise to victims., Officers believe there are many more allegations to come, and Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the national lead for child protection and abuse investigations, told the Guardian: “We are now having to come to terms, as a society, and we are going to have to recognise and accept, that during the 1970s and 1980s in particular, there was widespread sexual abuse of children taking place., “These allegations and the vast majority of cases were never reported to the authorities. Some victims did not think they were going to be believed. There was one constant factor: there was an abuse of power … to satisfy their sexual desires.”, Among those convicted were care home boss John Allen, 78, jailed for 14 years for attacking five child victims between 1976 and 1984, Timothy Mawer, 51, a badminton coach jailed for abusing seven victims in the 1980s and 90s, and John Clifford Davies, 61, a children’s home worker jailed for 24 years for a string offences in the 1970s and 80s., The national operation coordinating claims of non-recent child sexual abuse began in 2014 and is called Operation Hydrant. It began after the Jimmy Savile scandal prompted more victims to come forward., Since Hydrant’s launch, 7,000 suspects have been identified, with 11,346 allegations of attacks received from 9,343 victims, all concerning sexual abuse of children. Some claims date back to the 1940s., Of the alleged offences, 47% were not investigated by police, in over a third of these cases because the suspect was dead. In a fifth of discontinued claims, suspects could not be identified. More than one-third of the allegations resulted in convictions at court, with 6% resulting in acquittal., The conviction rate comes despite cases from long ago being harder to investigate because of fewer, if any, forensic clues., Some paedophiles who had escaped justice were convicted of multiple attacks, with one found guilty of 78 offences, based on allegations made by 10 victims. It is the first time Operation Hydrant has released conviction figures for non-recent child sexual abuse. Bailey, who is chief constable of Norfolk police, said: “There was an epidemic of it in the 1970s and 1980s. We do not understand the true scale of it. There is a lot to come out. There are a lot more victims who are yet to come forward., “The really difficult thing to come to terms with is the untold damage that’s been done to victims and survivors. Some could not cope. It’s the toll that it has taken on their lives. Some victims committed suicide. Some coped, some are in the mental care system. The horrors bestowed on these children are horrific.”, Contemporary cases of child sexual abuse are also rising. “Policing today is having to deal with the sins of the past,” the chief constable said, with some paedophiles who offended in the past still presenting a danger today., Bailey said: “It is crucial we continue to listen to the voices of those abused and investigate allegations thoroughly and impartially, irrespective of when the offence took place.”, In March 2019, Johnson, while foreign secretary, tried to deflect criticism about police cuts and told LBC radio: “I think an awful lot of money, an awful lot of police time, now goes into these historic offences and all this malarkey, and you know £60m I saw has been spaffed up the wall on some investigation into historic child abuse? What on earth is that going to do to protect the public now?”, Reacting to the new figures, Louise Haigh, Labour’s policing spokesperson, said: “These were utterly sickening crimes, and, despite being shamefully undermined by the prime minister, the police have operated with integrity and the utmost professionalism in bringing perpetrators to justice in these cases., “Those victims of child sexual abuse have seen a lifetime of torment now end in convictions. The prime minister should have the decency to look them in the eye and apologise for claiming it was a waste of money.”, Disastrous cases such as Operation Midland, where the Metropolitan police fell for the lies of a fantasist as they pursued bogus claims against high-profile figures, led to some scepticism about the need to pursue non-recent cases., Police say “persons of public prominence” make up 3% of suspects and include 44 politicians, mostly at a local level, 60 people from the entertainment industry, 31 from music and 30 from the world of sport., Allegations flooded in after the Guardian revealed claims of an abuse cover-up in football after Andy Woodward bravely came forward. A government inquiry into child sexual abuse and claims of a cover-up continues., Gabrielle Shaw, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: “We know from what victims and survivors tell us that being able to report what happened to the police is healing for many people, sometimes even when a case cannot be pursued. Thirty-five percent of offenders brought to justice for non-recent abuse is very encouraging.”, • If you feel you need help then the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) provides support to adults who experienced abuse as a child.

Both Mrs Sacoolas and Prince Andrew must cooperate with law enforcement., “I call upon my government, the US, to return Mrs Sacoolas to the UK to face justice”., She said Andrew needed to “answer questions about Jeffrey Epstein and his own behaviour,” adding: “In both countries everyone is equal in the eyes of the law.”, Seiger said it was “terrible advice” for the prince and for Sacoolas if they were being advised that “it’s all going to go away” and they should just “wait it out”., Last month, the New York state attorney, Geoffrey Berman, accused the prince of “zero cooperation” and not responding to requests by the FBI and US lawyers for an interview over his friendship with Epstein., Andrew was later said to be “angry and bewildered” about the claims, with sources close to him saying he had not been approached to speak about the case., Dunn was killed when his motorbike was in collision with a car outside a US military base in Northamptonshire in August. Sacoolas, 42, the wife of a US intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, claimed diplomatic immunity after the crash and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international controversy., She was charged with causing the teenager’s death by dangerous driving, but the US has refused an extradition request., Seiger said he had “reached out” to Bloom after realising “that there was a common thread running between these cases.”, He said: “It’s about evasion of justice., “These are the two greatest allies in the world and they follow a rules-based system. No-one, no matter who you are … is above the law., “We all break the rules from time to time but we don’t get to walk away and hide.”, In a message to Prince Andrew, Seiger said: “if you have nothing to hide, get on a plane …”, adding: “there’s no other way”., Seiger said the lawyers were not calling for a “straight swap”, adding, “but at the heart of extradition treaties is reciprocity.”, The US government’s refusal to extradite Sacoolas was “legally indefensible” and “effectively ripping up the treaty,” he said., Andrew, who stepped down from royal duties in November after his disastrous interview on BBC’s Newsnight programme over his relationship with Epstein, is reportedly “committed to the legal process”. At the time he stood down, he insisted: “I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency”., Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein, has alleged she was instructed to have sex with Andrew on three occasions from the age of 17. The prince categorically denies he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with her., While a US investigation is looking at possible “conspirators” who worked with Epstein, Bloom’s alleged victims are involved in a separate civil lawsuit., A source close to Andrew has previously been reported saying: “The duke is not under any obligation to talk to lawyers representing alleged victims of Epstein at the moment, but he is totally willing to talk to any law enforcement agencies, be they the police or FBI.”, Any FBI interview Andrew agrees to give would be voluntary at this stage, and could take place in the UK.jeffrey epstein accusers join harry dunn plea uk us anne sacoolas andrew", "label": 0}, "train-128": {"text": "\nArron Banks donated £2,000 to Tory Andrea Jenkyns's campaign\n, Leave.EU co-founder gave money to pro-Brexit West Yorkshire MP’s election fund, \nRajeev Syal, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 13.07 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 15.33 EST\n\n, The controversial Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks, who was barred from joining the Conservative party, gave a cash donation to a Tory MP’s general election campaign, it has been revealed. Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns has defended receiving money from the businessman in November, weeks before she held her seat of Morley and Outwood in West Yorkshire., It is the first time that the insurance entrepreneur has made a political donation since Leave.EU was found to have broken electoral law in 2018. That year, Banks was prevented from joining the Tories after urging hardline Brexiters to flood the party to depose the then prime minister, Theresa May., Banks has consistently denied claims that he received money from Russia, but the source of his wealth has been under scrutiny since he gave £9m to Leave.EU, the largest political donation in British history., Speaking from New Zealand, Banks told the Guardian that the donation of £2,000 to Jenkyns’ office was a reflection of a thawing of relationships between Leave.EU and the Conservative party since Boris Johnson took over the party., “We are much friendlier with the Conservative party,” he said. “We supported them during the campaign and so we have a fairly cordial relationship. Boris is doing a great job. I have just been watching President Trump’s State of the Union address, so I think I can say that Boris is making Britain great again.”, Jenkyns received his donation, he said, because of her close links with Leave.EU. She has also featured on Westmonster, the website he helped to bankroll., “Andrea has been a big supporter of Leave.EU and I supposed I thought it would be good to offer my personal support,” he said., Banks said he was not aware of any checks by the Conservative party about whether he was allowed to give money, given that he was barred from joining the party in 2018., Jenkyns, whose majority increased from 2,104 to 11,267, defended receiving the money. “This was a personal donation to my re-election campaign. All donations to my campaign have been properly and transparently declared in the usual way,” she said., Banks emerged on to the political scene in 2014 when, having been a Tory donor, he publicly defected to Ukip, led by Nigel Farage. Since then, he has handed millions to political parties and organisations campaigning to leave the EU. Questions were raised about the whether Leave.EU broke electoral spending rules., The Electoral Commission concluded in May 2018 that Leave.EU had committed multiple breaches of electoral spending law during the EU referendum and fined it £70,000, saying the “unlawful overspend” was at least £77,380 but may well have been higher., The commission also found that Leave.EU inaccurately reported three loans it had received from companies controlled by Banks., However, the commission found no evidence that Leave.EU received donations or paid-for services from Cambridge Analytica for its referendum campaigning and found that the relationship with the political campaign agency “did not develop beyond initial scoping work”., Banks responded by accusing the commission of a “politically motivated attack on Brexit” and threatened to take legal action., The Metropolitan police announced in September that it would be taking no further action against Leave.EU for spending offences in the Brexit referendum, despite accepting that it had broken the law., Farage claimed in April that Banks would not be handing over political donations in future because he had been “badly burned” by repeated questions over the £9m he contributed to the Brexit campaign., On Wednesday, Banks said he would consider making further donations and claimed that he was still pursuing legal action against the commission that would challenge its previous ruling.., “We have issued against the Electoral Commission and are talking about whether to settle or not. The police exonerated us. We are keen to see why they the commission did what they did.”, Banks confirmed that he was still pursuing legal action against the investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr, despite dropping two elements of his libel claim in January., Cadwalladr has won a series of prestigious journalism prizes for her work, published in the Guardian and Observer, exposing the Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting scandal and spending by pro-Brexit campaigners in the EU referendum., Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP who has previously called for an inquiry into Banks’s links to Russia, said: “It is no surprise that the man who broke electoral law but against whom the government took no action has since decided to help prop the Tories up.”, The National Crime Agency previously said it found no evidence Leave.EU and Banks broke the law.

The group is calling for greater action from government and the public in tackling the climate emergency., The common law offence of public nuisance, which was typically used for “obstructing the highway”, has all but disappeared and been replaced by specific criminal offences under different legislation., There could be a political advantage to writing the offence into statute, as it would allow politicians to send a message to the public that they support or reject such a move., Dick told the assembly: “Ever since the first large-scale Extinction Rebellion protest in April last year I have been talking publicly and with the government about the potential for change to powers and to legislation that would enable the police to deal better with protests in general given that the act that we work to – thePublic Order Act – is now very old, dating to 1986., “But specifically to deal with protests where people are not primarily violent or seriously disorderly but, as in this instance, had an avowed intent to bring policing to its knees and the city to a halt and were prepared to use the methods we all know they did to do that.”, Dick repeated previous calls for a review of the act, as well as a lowering of the threshold before which conditions can be imposed on protests or assemblies., “There is a phrase which is we need to be satisfied that ‘serious’ disorder, damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community has taken place,” she said. “That’s not further defined. But it seems in law, a high threshold.

If it is carrying weapons for use in Yemen then they could be used in war crimes and abuses for years to come.”, He added: “Arms-dealing governments like the one in the UK have played a central role in strengthening the Saudi dictatorship and fuelling the devastating war in Yemen.”, Last July, the court of appeal ruled that all future arms exports to Riyadh that could be used in Yemen had to be halted because UK ministers and officials had failed to properly assess the humanitarian risks involved., Britain is a major supplier to Saudi Arabia, having licensed at least £5.3bn worth of arms since 2015. Missiles made in the UK are used by British-supplied Typhoon jets in the Saudi airforce., According to the Yemen Data Project, more than 8,630 civilians have been killed during the conflict, which began in 2015. Many have died as a result of more than 20,000 air raids by the Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in the country., Bahri, the state-owned shipping company that owns the Yanbu, confirmed to Belgian media that military equipment was onboard but denied it was to take on any such kit at Antwerp., The ship has travelled from North America, where it has docked in the US and Canada, and is travelling around Europe before heading to Saudi Arabia and other nearby countries. It is meant to stop in Cherbourg and Genoa, where a dockworkers’ strike is planned., On a previous visit to several European ports in May 2019, the vessel was carrying US-manufactured military components and equipment worth $47m (£36m), much of it linked to military aircraft, according to Amnesty International., Containers of arms were loaded onboard in Belgium and Spain, and howitzer cannon were due to be loaded in France although pressure groups in the country successfully took legal action to halt the arms transfer at the time.dont let saudi arms ship dock in uk campaigners military yemen war", "label": 0}, "train-131": {"text": "\nChildren's care system in Scotland needs replacing, review finds\n, Calls for ‘fractured’ system to be scrapped as Sturgeon says it is letting children down, \nSeverin Carrell Scotland editor, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 10.48 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 11.21 EST\n\n, A major review of failures in the Scottish care system has called for it to be scrapped and replaced by a new unified service., The independent care review, set up by Nicola Sturgeon in 2017, estimates that the “fractured and bureaucratic” system operating in Scotland costs the country more than £2.7bn a year., “It’s clearly not a system,” said Fiona Duncan, the review’s chair. “It’s lots of different bureaucracies and rules that all operate alongside each other and bump into one another.”, The review called for a new unified children’s care service and strategy, based around a 10-year plan written by all the services and agencies involved in the current care system, which need to be properly funded by Sturgeon’s government., Sturgeon told MSPs on Wednesday afternoon that the review was one of the most important during her tenure as first minister. Scotland had let too many care-experienced children down, she said, often damaging lives., With opposition parties promising support in implementing its recommendations as quickly as possible, she said the reformed system “should have love and nurture at its heart. The priority must be the provision not of a series of placements and arrangements driven by the needs of bureaucracy, but one of stable, safe and loving lives.”, In what is thought to be most forensic analysis ever undertaken, the review said £942m was spent each year by councils and agencies on the formal care system, including fostering, adoption, secure care and the youth justice system., There are about 15,000 children currently in the Scottish care system. Another £198m is spent on other public services linked to those services, including mental health provision., In addition, the review estimates a further £875m is spent on fixing the system’s mistakes and failings, leading to a total cost to the public sector of over £2bn., The review’s analysts said nearly all that spending can be attributed to devolved services overseen the Scottish government. Its overall budget is just over £30bn a year, implying that nearly 7% of its budget goes on supporting care-experienced children and adults., Drawing on analysis and studies from across the UK, they calculated that another £732m in taxes and national insurance payments was lost because care-experienced adults have significantly lower incomes, adding to the system’s overall costs., The review, which included 5,500 interviews with care-experienced people and those who worked or lived with them, said the care-experienced were two-and-a-half times more likely to be excluded from school and almost twice as likely to use drugs moderately., Children living in the poorest 10% of neighbourhoods were 20 times more likely to be taken into care than those in the wealthiest 10%; care-experienced people were twice as likely to have no educational qualifications and twice as likely to experience homelessness., On average, their incomes are three-quarters that of non-care-experienced workers and they are more than three times as likely not to have had a full-time job by the age of 26., “They’re over-represented in places where they shouldn’t be over-represented, like homelessness and justice, and they under-represented in places where they should have the same opportunities as everyone else, like education,” Duncan said, as she launched the review’s conclusions., Across nearly 80 recommendations, it called for children and young people to have far greater say in their care; far greater investment on building life-long relationships and a heavier focus on keeping families intact., “There’s a legislative labyrinth which pushes people around a system that actually isn’t enabling,” Duncan said. “We don’t have an enabling legislative environment in Scotland for us to do the right thing for children and families.”, The care system “has to provide safe, therapeutic and loving environments for children”, she added. “It has to, as far as possible, put children in family settings where they can grow up and thrive and flourish.”, John Carnochan, the former police officer who helped set up Strathclyde police’s violence reduction unit, said about 50% of inmates in Barlinnie prison in Glasgow were care-experienced. , “The evidence is now so compelling that if we don’t invest in early years, supporting families, we will continue to spend more in their later lives, and throughout their lives,” he said.childrens care system in scotland needs replacing review finds", "label": 0}, "train-132": {"text": "\nCouple plan to spend lottery jackpot on new knees\n, Grandparents Malcolm and Bev Dixon from Leigh say £1m win will provide ‘new lease of life’, \nAmy Walker, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 10.18 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 19.45 EST\n\n, A couple who won £1m on the national lottery plan to spend their winnings on a pair of replacement knees., Malcolm and Bev Dixon, from Leigh in Greater Manchester, initially believed they had scooped £1,000 after matching five numbers and the bonus ball in last Wednesday’s Lotto draw., After becoming millionaires, the grandparents said the first thing they intended to buy was a new pair of knees for Mrs Dixon, a 50-year-old pub landlady., “This win couldn’t come at a better time.

He told his friend, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, that he was “skint” so could not buy it himself, Penny said., However, an order for £76 worth of acid was declined because of a lack of funds, prompting the friend to speak to his father to try to borrow the money, the court heard. But the father refused to help, saying that the chemical could be used to make explosives, it was alleged., Penny said: “His father said no and explained that acid could be used to manufacture explosives, and so no purchase was ever completed. He ignored further calls which were made to him by the defendant over the coming days.”, Days later, Abedi was in contact with other friends and acquaintances, making multiple transactions and depositing money in their bank accounts, money that was subsequently used to make purchases of sulphuric acid on Amazon, the court heard., The prosecutor, examining phone records of various associates, told jurors that sim cards were regularly swapped between smartphones and phones not connected to the internet, sometimes staying in a handset for just a few moments., The prosecution alleges that Abedi helped his brother in his efforts to stockpile chemicals and materials to make the bomb, making him “just as guilty”., At about midday on Wednesday, part-way through the evidence, the trial had to be halted after the defendant complained that he was “in some pain”. The court heard that Abedi had been feeling unwell before proceedings started but decided to attend nonetheless., The judge, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, told the jury that Abedi was “feeling worse not better now and is in some pain”. Baker said it would be inappropriate to continue in the absence of Abedi and adjourned the hearing until the following day., “It is important that Mr Abedi is able to concentrate on the opening and for that reason I have arranged for some inquiries to be made about his condition, to ensure that if he needs any medical intervention it is provided properly and effectively,” he said., The trial continues.manchester arena bomber brother hashem abedi thwarted in efforts to buy bomb ingredients by friends father", "label": 0}, "train-134": {"text": "\nGraffiti threats to Derry reporter who witnessed death of Lyra McKee\n, Leona O’Neill targeted in fresh slurs after reporting on Bloody Sunday march, \nHenry McDonald, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 08.51 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 09.08 EST\n\n, A Northern Ireland reporter who witnessed the murder of journalist Lyra McKee in Derry last April has received renewed threats in the city., Graffiti branding Leona O’Neill a “tout”, or informer, and falsely linking her to MI5 appeared in Derry’s Creggan area on Tuesday evening., O’Neill, a Belfast Telegraph columnist and freelance writer and broadcaster, posted a picture of the graffiti on Twitter last night, which also denounced her as a “shit stirrer”., The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) condemned the graffiti as “vile and dangerous”., It is understood the latest threats to O’Neill came about after she revealed that a republican flute band with links to Saoradh – the political allies of the New IRA – had taken part in a Bloody Sunday commemoration march in the city last weekend., The presence of Saoradh and its supporters at the march created controversy in Derry. The Bloody Sunday Trust said Sunday’s march had nothing to do with it., Tony Doherty, the trust’s chairman, whose father, Paddy, was one of 13 civilians shot dead in the city by the Parachute Regiment in 1972, said anger over the presence of Saoradh and an aligned band was misplaced., “We don’t normally court controversy but we want to make it clear that we don’t have any association with that march,” he said., Responding to the graffiti, O’Neill said: “I am neither a MI5 tout nor a shit stirrer. I am a journalist, working in my city trying to provide for my family. I consider this a threat to my safety. I call on community leaders to help me get this dangerous slur removed now.”, In a joint statement, the NUJ’s general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, and assistant general secretary, Séamus Dooley, said there could be no place in a democracy for such behaviour., “We strongly condemn this vile and dangerous threat. It is a clear attempt to intimidate a hard-working, committed journalist. Leona has proven herself to be a journalist of resilience with a strong passion for Derry. We would call on civic and community leaders to support journalists and to defend media freedom. “Journalists must be free to report without intimidation. To describe a journalist as an agent of a police force is dangerous and poses a threat to their ability to do their job,” they added., Last year Twitter and Facebook came under pressure to take action over an online hate campaign against O’Neill., The Derry-based journalist has been subjected to consistent abuse from conspiracy theorists and internet trolls after witnessing Lyra McKee being killed by a New IRA gunman during riots in Derry in April 2019. The abuse has included false accusations that she had made up her account and even that she was responsible for the killing., McKee’s murder grabbed worldwide attention as she was the first reporter to be killed on duty in Northern Ireland since the Sunday World investigative journalist Martin O’Hagan was shot dead by loyalists in 2001.leona oneill new graffiti threat derry reporter witnessed death of lyra mckee", "label": 0}, "train-135": {"text": "\nHome Office seeking to drop Theresa May's 28-day limit on police bail\n, Priti Patel proposes doubling or trebling time suspects can be bailed without charge, \nJamie Grierson Home affairs correspondent, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 08.03 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 17.11 EST\n\n, The home secretary, Priti Patel, has bowed to pressure from rank-and-file police officers and is seeking to rip up changes to bail rules spearheaded by Theresa May., Patel has proposed doubling or trebling the length of pre-charge bail, which since 2017 has been limited to 28 days under changes drawn up by May when she was home secretary and implemented when she was prime minister., The proposals put out to consultation by Patel would delay the point at which magistrates’ approval for the extension of bail is required from three months to six, nine or 12 months., May introduced the cap on pre-charge bail as part of the Policing and Crime Act 2017. The cap followed a series of high-profile cases, during which the suspect remained on bail for more than a year before ultimately being released without charge., Among the most notable cases was that of the broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, who backed the 28-day limit after he was placed on police bail for a year while officers investigated unfounded allegations of historical sexual abuse, which he always denied, before the case against him was dropped. He claimed lost earnings and legal fees had cost him more than £200,000., But the Police Federation, which represents tens of thousands of rank-and-file officers, has levelled severe and sustained criticism of May’s changes since they were first proposed., The domestic abuse charity Women’s Aid has previously called for the changes to be reversed as releasing suspects without bail conditions can leave abuse survivors unprotected while they wait for perpetrators to be charged., Patel said the proposals would provide a “voice to victims” and give the police the support they need to protect the public from harm., Other changes include removing the presumption against pre-charge bail and allowing officers of a lower rank to authorise and extend pre-charge bail., A duty on officers to use pre-charge bail in cases where it is necessary and proportionate, including for cases where there are risks to victims and where it could prevent reoffending, is proposed., The Home Office said it would consult victims of crime as well as individuals who have been released under investigation about how the current system could be improved, as well as seeking views on the effectiveness of existing bail conditions., The National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for bail management, the chief constable Darren Martland, said: “In the years since the bail legislation was amended, the police service has worked hard to implement the changes in the spirit they were introduced. What has become clear in that time is that a number of unintended consequences have followed, presenting fresh challenges for the police service and the wider criminal justice system.”, Richard Miller, head of justice at the Law Society of England and Wales, said: “In the interests of both justice to citizens not yet charged and to public safety, pre-charge bail and release under investigation must be used appropriately., “The 2017 act, though flawed, sought to introduce greater efficiency to police investigations by limiting the use of pre-charge bail and setting limits … but officers often struggle to investigate cases expeditiously because of under-resourcing., “That’s because years of underfunding has left our criminal justice system at breaking point; it simply does not have the resources to function effectively., “Reform to pre-charge bail, though necessary, is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. If we want swift, fair and efficient justice we must invest in every aspect of our ailing criminal justice system. Otherwise, more crime may fall through the cracks of investigation and prosecution.”, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate are conducting a joint inspection of how police forces manage changes to bail and are expected to publish their reports by the summer.home office priti patel 28 day limit on police bail theresa may", "label": 0}, "train-136": {"text": "\nSentencing: minister rejects European human rights convention warning\n, Matt Hancock’s comments come as UK seeks tougher sentencing for terrorists, \nKate Proctor Political correspondent, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 07.14 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 07.36 EST\n\n, A senior government minister has raised further questions over Britain’s relationship with the European convention on human rights (ECHR) as Boris Johnson scrambles to push through tougher sentencing for terrorists., Legal experts have suggested the government’s intended plan to extend the time terrorists serve in prison could be in breach of the ECHR, to which Britain has been signed up for decades., Asked what he made of the warnings, Matt Hancock said he had heard the arguments from those against the changes but that they should go ahead., The health and social care secretary said: “What about our human rights? What about the human rights of people to be able to walk freely around the streets of London?”, Following the Streatham terror attack on Sunday, and deaths of two people at London Bridge last November, the government wants to table emergency legislation to ban the automatic release of prisoners halfway through their sentences. Instead, they want to increase the minimum time served to two-thirds., Lawyers think prisoners could appeal against the proposed changes, which are due to be tabled by the end of the week, as the ECHR contains guidelines on retrospective reforms to prison sentences., Asked again about the protests from human rights advocates who say the changes would be in breach of the ECHR, Hancock told Sky News: “Well, it is in favour of the safety of the public. Sometimes people are released before the end of their sentences. It’s not about extending sentences. It’s about when people are released relative to the end of their sentences.”, He added: “Often in government you get a point where you have to balance the rights of different people and in this case it’s weighing up the rights of an individual whose committed terrorist offences and his right to leave prison early against the rights of people to walk around Streatham or anywhere in our country free from the threat of terrorism., “So I hear the arguments that some people are making that actually we shouldn’t make these changes but I think that I feel very strongly that we should and so would the vast majority of the British public I would imagine.”, The ECHR is a separate institution to the EU and Britain remains a member and bound by its rules. It can derogate – in effect take a temporary break from it – in circumstances of emergency, war or “threat to life of the nation” under article 15., The government has so far not suggested how it could bring in the new terror sentencing laws and abide by the ECHR, or whether it will ask to derogate., The prime minister’s official spokesman said on Tuesday: “We are going to ensure that we will bring forward the necessary legislation to protect the public because that is the right thing to do.”, Asked again if the government would deviate from ECHR rulings to bring in the fast-tracked laws, he said: “As the justice secretary said, we believe that we can bring forward this legislation and we are committed to doing so.”, On whether the government considers the current situation an emergency, he said: “That’s not something we have set out.”, The UK derogated from article 5 of the ECHR, the right to liberty and security, during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.sentencing minister rejects european human rights convention warning", "label": 0}, "train-137": {"text": "\nStreatham attacker 'had his heart set on martyrdom’\n, Neil Basu said Sudesh Amman could have been diverted from hate but that moment passed, \nJamie Grierson Home affairs correspondent, \n\nWed 5 Feb 2020 06.57 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 5 Feb 2020 17.19 EST\n\n, Sudesh Amman, the convicted terrorist who launched a stabbing attack in Streatham, had his “heart set on martyrdom”, the country’s most senior counter-terrorism officer has said, suggesting there was little that could have been done to rehabilitate him., Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Neil Basu said there could have been a point earlier in Amman’s life when he could have been diverted from hate and violence, but the moment had passed. And he warned further attacks would happen as police and the security services were dealing with 3,000 subjects of interest and could not “watch all of them all the time”., His comments come after his boss, the Met commissioner Cressida Dick, defended the surveillance team that was tailing Amman before he stabbed two people on Streatham High Road on Sunday, 10 days after his release from prison., The government has subsequently unveiled plans to retrospectively alter the conditions of jail sentences imposed on terrorist offenders to ensure none of them are automatically released before their full term is spent., Basu said: “Police and the security services knew the attacker posed a significant risk and we were, unfortunately, proved right in our decision to place him under surveillance., “But with 3,000 or so subjects of interest currently on our radar and many convicted terrorists soon due to be released from prison, we simply cannot watch all of them all the time., “Part of the solution must be ensuring that those who pose the greatest threat to our society are removed from it, and so my colleagues and I are supportive of the government’s plans to strengthen our ability to keep the most dangerous terrorists locked up for longer.”, Basu said Amman’s case reinforced the importance of Prevent, a controversial anti-radicalisation programme that sees thousands of individuals referred to authorities over suspicions they may turn to terrorism., He said: “We know that rehabilitating and deradicalising terrorist offenders is incredibly difficult. It is hard to change someone’s mind when their views have become so entrenched that they are willing to commit atrocities in support of their ideology., “Sunday’s attacker had his heart set on martyrdom before he was even convicted, but there was, at one point earlier in his life, still an opportunity to divert him away from hatred and violence., “That is why early intervention, through the Prevent programme, is absolutely key. We need families, friends, colleagues and local communities to recognise that early intervention is not ruining someone’s life but saving it, and potentially that of others, too.” , Wearing a fake suicide belt, Amman stole a knife from a shop on Streatham High Road and stabbed two bystanders. He was shot dead by officers within 60 seconds., Giving evidence to members of the London assembly’s police and crime committee on Wednesday on how Amman was able to carry out the attack with “reportedly 20 officers” watching him, Dick said: “Surveillance officers are sometimes armed, sometimes not. They’re highly trained., “They’re armed when it’s believed they may need to defend themselves against a particularly high level of threat. They’re conducting covert surveillance. They’re not providing man-to-man marking. It is inevitable that there could be a time delay before somebody totally unexpectedly does something.”, Dick said it was not possible for the police to prevent every attack. “I wish I could assure the public that everybody who poses a risk on the streets could be subject to some sort of thing that would stop them being able to stab anybody ever, but it is clearly not possible,” she said., Amman was jailed for three years and four months in December 2018 for possessing and distributing terrorist documents. He was freed automatically halfway through his sentence and put under 24-hour police surveillance. Sources have said he was an “extremely concerning individual”., Dick said a team of 75 officers were working to gather evidence for the coroner about Amman’s attack.

Police were called in and suspicion fell on a neighbouring farmer, David Aeron Owens., The complainant, who has not been named, pointed out to officers the cow he believed was his. PC Gareth Jones was handed what Owens claimed was the cow’s passport – its identification document., Unsatisfied, police oversaw the taking of blood samples from the disputed animal, which were compared against samples from cows on the complainant’s farm to prove a familial link. The cow in question was returned home and Owens, 51, pleaded guilty to theft at Swansea crown court this week., Jones said: “This has been a long and protracted inquiry, and it has taken a lot of work and patience to get to this point. Without the use of the heifer’s DNA we would not have been able to prove that it had been stolen by Mr Owens., “We are proud to be the first force in the UK to use a cow’s DNA in a criminal case, and will continue to use innovative methods to get justice for victims.”, The cow was reported stolen in December 2017. During the criminal investigation, Owens launched proceedings against Dyfed-Powys police over the way blood samples were taken from the cow, as he had not been willing for this to happen. A judicial review found the force acted lawfully., Jones said: “I must thank the victim in this case for the determination shown in wanting to see justice being done. It has been a long investigation, but we hope he is satisfied with the outcome., “What this case shows us is that where the farming community works with the police, reporting crimes and providing us with vital information, we can be successful in taking out prosecutions.”, He added: “I echo comments made by the judge, who said Mr Owens, as a farmer, would be well aware of the need for a level of trust in the rural community. In committing these offences, he has played a part in breaking down that trust, which will be difficult to build back up.”, Owens was sentenced to pay a £4,000 fine and pay £400 costs. welsh police solve moo dunnit using dna test on cow", "label": 0}, "train-140": {"text": "\nFox causes mischief after sneaking into Houses of Parliament\n, ‘We have seen some strange things in Parliament since 2017, but this tops it’ , \nLucy Campbell and PA Media, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 18.20 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 18.58 EST\n\n, A fox caused chaos after wandering into parliament on Thursday evening.

Campaigners have called on the government to fund legal advice so claimants can be helped to apply., The Home Office has paid out a total of just £62,198 to 36 people so far – just over 3% of claimants – out of a compensation pot that could distribute somewhere between £200m and £570m. Over 1,100 people have submitted claims. It is not clear how many people were affected by the scandal – many people lost jobs and homes, were denied benefits or healthcare, and in extreme cases were detained or deported – but since the government first apologised for the mistake in April 2018 over 8,000 people have been given documents confirming they are here legally., A two-year extension to the compensation deadline has been introduced, so that people affected by the immigration scandal, in which the Home Office wrongly classified thousands of legal UK residents as illegal immigrants, now have until April 2023 to claim., The Home Office has also promised to make the application process more flexible, agreeing to take a wider range of circumstances into account. People will no longer be asked to prove that they took immediate steps to resolve their immigration status when they realised there was a problem., Charities working with claimants said that many people affected were so alarmed at being told they were here illegally that for years they avoided any interactions with the Home Office or any official organisation., The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: “Successive governments failed the Windrush generation, which is why we have listened to feedback from community leaders and those affected, to hear how the government can begin to do justice to those who have contributed so much to our country.”, The Home Office’s announcement was welcomed by groups supporting people to apply for compensation but there was disappointment that no money had been allocated to pay for legal advice. There has been funding for Citizens Advice to assist applicants but feedback from claimants has been mixed., One of those still awaiting compensation is Joycelyn John.The Home Office booked her on to a flight to Grenada, a country she had not lived in since leaving aged four in 1963 after telling her she was here illegally. She applied last April and is angry at the long wait, not least because she remains in debt as a result of the issue. She spent 18 months semi-destitute in Grenada, before being allowed to return when the problem was uncovered in 2018., “I ring every week and they tell me: ‘I can’t give you any information, it is with a case worker, it is being processed,’” she said. Receiving compensation would represent “an end to all the grief”., Some applicants who have been granted money say they are unhappy with the amount, and put this down to not having had advice when they filled in the form. Glenda Caesar said she was going to turn down the £22,000 she was offered in December, describing it as “insultingly low” because it only covered a year’s loss of earnings even though she was out of work for a decade because she was deemed to be here illegally. She came to Britain legally as a three-month-old child in 1961. The Home Office scheme allows people to ask for the payment to be reviewed., Martin Forde, the barrister who designed the scheme, said the changes meant the scheme would “be easier to navigate, more accessible than ever and will provide fair compensation to all those affected”., Bell Rebeiro-Addy, the shadow immigration minister, said it was disappointing that so few people have received payments. “It is good that the scheme has been extended but there are people who are still destitute after what happened to them. They need to access support quickly,” she said., Windrush campaigner Patrick Vernon said he hoped the government would fund advice services to assist applicants, in the same way that money had been allocated to fund organisations helping EU nationals apply for settled status after Brexit. Applicants have to fill in an 18-page form, which has 43 pages of guidance, and requires substantial documentary evidence. Lawyer Jacqueline McKenzie, who has been giving pro bono advice to dozens of those affected by the Windrush scandal, said she was “astonished by the very low rates that have been paid out”., She said: “A very large cohort of people are really struggling to make applications even with the help of the Citizens Advice.”, , The home secretary apologised for the Home Office’s ‘institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness’ in the way it dealt with the Windrush generationwindrush victims still waiting for payments", "label": 0}, "train-143": {"text": "\nDerek Mackay's resignation may derail SNP's policy agenda\n, Fellow MSPs have called the former finance secretary’s behaviour ‘grooming’ , \nSeverin Carrell Scotland editor, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 13.58 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 14.50 EST\n\n, Nicola Sturgeon has been confronted by two misconduct cases involving ministers since becoming party leader, but the sudden resignation of her finance secretary threatens to derail her government’s policy agenda and its reputation for probity., Until Wednesday night Derek Mackay had presided over numerous party conferences as its chairman and business convenor for seven years, and was widely seen as a credible candidate to succeed Sturgeon., The revelation that Mackay had bombarded a 16-year-old boy with hundreds of online messages and texts led opposition MSPs to suggest the then finance secretary’s conduct was tantamount to grooming. Even Joanna Cherry, a lawyer and SNP MP, suggested on Twitter that it amounted to “grooming behaviour”., The messages, showing Mackay had invited the schoolboy for dinner and to attend a rugby reception at the Scottish parliament, began on 2 August, and ended on 1 February, five days ago., The boy’s last responses to Mackay were on 27 December, when the then minister said the teenager was “looking good with that new haircut”, and called him “really cute”. Mackay sent him 18 messages that day, starting at 00.03am that morning., But as shock about Mackay’s conduct reverberated around Holyrood, questions also emerged about the timing of Sturgeon’s actions., Today it emerged that the Scottish Sun first told Sturgeon’s office about its plans to publish Mackay’s messages at about 5.30pm on Wednesday, putting in train an urgent series of conversations between Sturgeon, Mackay and SNP lawyers., Sturgeon’s official spokesman confirmed on Thursday afternoon that Alan Muir, the Scottish Sun’s editor, had telephoned him before 6pm to lay out the substance of the Sun story. Later that evening – her spokesman refused to say when – Mackay agreed to resign., It was not until 8am on Thursday, 14 hours after she was told of the allegations and nine hours after the Sun’s stories went online, that Sturgeon announced Mackay’s resignation in a short statement., The spokesman said they wanted to give Mackay time to tell his family about the Sun’s revelations. Yet, despite their acknowledged seriousness, it was not until noon on Thursday that Sturgeon said in an emergency statement that he had also been suspended from the SNP., Sturgeon told MSPs she had not been able to do so until she had been able read the full extent of Mackay’s texts in the Sun. But the delay in announcing his suspension allowed Sturgeon to make her statement to parliament. There was no word, however, on whether Mackay would quit as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West, triggering a byelection. Sturgeon has deflected that and other questions about the case, insisting that the SNP investigation has to take place., Sources at the Sun insist that Sturgeon’s spokesman was given all the salient texts on Wednesday evening. Muir had two conversations with Sturgeon’s office that evening, giving them all the key information., Jackson Carlaw, interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said the delay in suspending Mackay was odd. “There was more than enough information at her disposal to suspend Mr Mackay as soon as she found it – that’s not a decision that needed to wait until lunchtime the following day,” he said., “The first minister’s main concern should be for this boy and his family, not her own PR requirements.”, Sturgeon has already overseen one ministerial resignation for misconduct. In November 2017, her then childcare and early years minister, Mark McDonald, resigned from her government and was suspended by the Scottish National party following allegations that he had sent inappropriate text messages to several women and had abused his position of power., It was the first major test of Sturgeon’s public support for a crackdown on male abuse of power in public life. The McDonald affair dragged on for months while the allegations were investigated by the party.

He is going on trial on 9 March facing 14 sexual offence charges, including one of attempted rape and one of intent to rape – charges that he has repeatedly denied., Salmond had resigned as an SNP member five months before he was first charged in January 2019, following a furious row with the Scottish government over its decision to release details of an internal investigation into misconduct allegations against him by two officials during his tenure as first minister., News of that investigation was leaked in August 2018, more than a year after Salmond lost his Westminster seat of Gordon in the 2017 general election, ending a 30-year parliamentary career at both Holyrood and Westminster., Salmond fought and won a civil case against the Scottish government, which admitted in court a fortnight earlier that it had botched its internal inquiry. It had appointed a human resources specialist to lead that inquiry who had had previous contact with the two complainants about their allegations., On the instructions of Lesley Evans, the permanent secretary, and Scotland’s chief civil servant, the government’s lawyers in court admitted that left the investigation “tainted by apparent bias”.derek mackays resignation may derail snps policy agenda", "label": 0}, "train-144": {"text": "\nBurglar sentenced to at least 34 years for 'sadistic' murder of woman, 89\n, Reece Dempster, 23, sexually assaulted Dorothy Woolmer and battered her around the head and body, PA Media, \n\nThu 6 Feb 2020 13.27 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2020 14.56 EST\n\n, A burglar has been sentenced to a minimum term of 34 years in prison for the “sexual or sadistic” murder of an 89-year-old woman in her own bed., Reece Dempster, 23, looked to the floor and nodded to the judge as he was sentenced at the Old Bailey on Thursday for breaking into the home of Dorothy Woolmer while she slept in August last year, brutally attacking her., Dempster, who said he had been drinking gin and smoking crack beforehand, sexually assaulted the elderly woman, who was less than 1.52 metres (5ft) tall and had osteoporosis, and battered her around the head and body, inflicting fatal injuries., The judge, Mr Justice Edis, appeared emotional as he praised Woolmer’s family for their dignity in sitting through proceedings., Regularly making eye contact with Dempster as he read out his sentence, the judge said: “I have no doubt your behaviour was influenced by your consumption of drink and crack cocaine, but that does not excuse what you did. Actually, it makes it worse. She was tiny and defenceless and you knew that. Because of you, she died an unimaginably dreadful death., “You seemed to have killed her for pleasure in your drunken state, the murder involved sexual or sadistic conduct. You are a very dangerous man.”, Dempster, who was nearly half a metre taller than his victim, initially admitted manslaughter but denied murder. However, he changed his pleas on the third day of the trial, also admitting two counts of assault by penetration., The court heard Dempster was raised by his grandmother, but became acquainted with his father, Mark Vaughan, a drug addict, in later years. It was Vaughan, the court was told, who encouraged Dempster to commit crime to feed their drug habits., The prosecutor, Anthony Orchard QC, said Dempster had two previous convictions for burglary in the area, and breached a suspended sentence at the time of the killing. However, he was not on a curfew or a tag at the time, he said., The court heard Dempster had “cased” Woolmer’s home in Waltheof Gardens, Tottenham, north London, having carried out gardening work at the property a month before the attack., He broke into the home on 3 August 2019 while Woolmer, who was known as Dot, was asleep. He then attacked and violated her body, in her bed, inflicting brutal injuries after finding a truncheon in the victim’s downstairs cupboard., He fled the scene the following morning with her purse and at least two bottles of alcohol, Vermouth and port, vomiting several times on the way., He later told an acquaintance that he “only got a hundred quid”, adding: “It wasn’t even worth it.”, Woolmer’s lifeless and bloodied body was found, semi-naked, in her bed, by her sister and a close friend who were concerned when she failed to answer the door for her morning newspaper., Her sister, Lilian Richardson, described how she had been unable to walk past Woolmer’s home since the killing, adding: “This is the most horrific thing we have all had to go through., “The fact that there is a person like him living and breathing the same air as Dot is unthinkable. He deserves to know how it has made us all feel. He deserves to spend the rest of his life locked away in a room … feeling powerless, like he made Dot feel that night.”, She added: “The events surrounding my sister’s death have brought extreme amounts of heartache and stress to me and my entire family as we are such a close family.

The escalating costs of HS2 call into question the way the UK designs and evaluates big infrastructure projects. We should take much more account of the impact on development and land values, especially if the uplift were shared with investors. Spending £3bn on land acquisition to date is surely wasteful. But little can be done without reintroducing regional and strategic planning., Before we turn our backs on Europe, we should learn from how the French succeeded in growing their towns and economies while keeping down car use and pollution. The crucial difference is not going for one grand national project or another, but joining up investment in development and infrastructure at a city region level, as a comparison of Lyons or Lille with Leeds would show., So let’s start by revisiting attempts to come up with regional or sub-regional plans and ask how much of the costs could be recovered from the uplift in land values. The late Sir Peter Hall proposed a relatively economic way of improving rail services, later named HS3. This would use a series of improvements, such as better signalling and junctions, not one big project, which is almost bound to go wrong. Such a policy would produce faster results, using public investment to secure multiple benefits, not just faster long-distance journeys.Dr Nicholas FalkExecutive director, The Urbed Trust, • At last the necessity for HS2 is being steered away from the need to get from London to Birmingham a bit quicker (The case for, 4 February; The case against, 4 February). The essential issue is capacity. If the public wants fewer heavy trucks on the roads then additional rail is the only answer. There are virtually no spare paths between London and the Midlands on the west coast mainline: £8bn-£10bn was spent in 2008-10 upgrading that line, but there is now nothing spare. A new line is needed, so why would you build a slow one? The data is regularly published in Modern Railways, but it is apparent that politicians and their advisers don’t read the industry journals., In all the furore about rising costs, politicians never ask why it is four times more expensive per mile compared with the LGV Est line in France. Perhaps land prices are lower in France, and each new LGV line has been dovetailed into existing termini in Paris, which might explain some of the lower costs. But really, four times as much here? Who’s making a killing?, Finally, why are the arguments presented as either we spend on HS2 or upgrade areas in other parts of the country? Why can’t it be both?Robert AshleyLondon, • Hurrah! At last you have hit the nail on the head and made the clear and coherent case for HS2 (Editorial, 6 February). Taken together with enhancement and integration of local networks to ensure maximum access to HS2, there is little doubt that the new line will more than pay for itself and stimulate development across the Midlands and north. There’s already been digging aplenty in Birmingham. More please, Mr Johnson, and soon.Roy Boffy Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, • Here are some other ways to spend £106bn: 15 tram systems like Manchester Metrolink £42bn, free bus services for everyone for 10 years £30bn, free ebike for every adult £34bn.

Those who planted this device were reckless or intended to cause that level of harm.”, Clarke said those responsible planned for the device to explode at around the time the UK left the EU – a claim rejected by sources close to dissidents., After the phone warning, police searched truck trailers but found nothing and the ferry sailed as planned without incident, he said., On Monday there was a second phone call to the media outlet, which prompted police to mount a two-day operation involving the search of 400 vehicles, leading to the discovery of a bomb attached to a truck in the Silverwood Industrial Estate in Lurgan. Army bomb disposal officers made it safe., Det Supt Sean Wright, from the PSNI’s terrorism investigation unit, told a press conference that dissident republicans had shown reckless disregard for life., “Had this vehicle travelled and the device had exploded at any point along the M1 in Northern Ireland, across the Westlink or into the harbour estate, the risks posed do not bear thinking about. The only conclusion that we can draw is that once again dissident republicans have shown a total disregard for the community, for businesses and for wider society.”, Sinn Féin’s policing spokesman Gerry Kelly told PA there could have been “catastrophic loss of life” if the device had detonated on board a ferry., Alan Chambers, an Ulster Unionist party’s policing board representative, said the bomb showed the dissidents did not care whom they put at risk. “The consequences could have been horrendous.”, However sources close to republican dissidents in Belfast challenged the police version that the bomb was meant to explode during a ferry crossing., They said the Continuity IRA instead was following standard armed republican tactics of transporting bombs over to England to commercial or strategic targets., “The plan was no different, although far smaller in scale, than the way the Provisional IRA smuggled the huge bomb that devastated Canary Wharf in 1996. There is no way republicans were planning to explode a bomb on a ferry.”, The Canary Wharf bomb, which signalled the end of the Provisional IRA’s 1994 ceasefire, was built by operatives from its East Tyrone Brigade and then transported in a lorry by activists from PIRA’s South Armagh Brigade., “The idea that anti-Good Friday Agreement republicans were going to blow up a ship to mark Brexit day is nonsense and propaganda,” the republican sources told the Guardian., Dissidents opposed to the peace process have staged attacks since well before Brexit. However dissident republicans linked with another splinter group, the Real IRA, have previously called the UK’s departure from the EU a “huge help” to Irish republicanism, saying it would fuel violent resistance to British rule in Northern Ireland., There were at least five attacks on security forces last year, which prompted Simon Byrne, the chief constable of the PSNI, to express concern at the “tempo and pace” of attacks and to warn that a hard border imposed by a no-deal Brexit could “trigger” other people to join dissident ranks., In a separate development, Conor Murphy, Sinn Féin’s minister for finance in the Stormont government, faced calls to resign over comments he made in 2007 about Paul Quinn, a 21-year-old man beaten to death by a gang that allegedly included IRA members., Murphy this week apologised for having accused Quinn of being a criminal, a claim that recently resurfaced and tripped up Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, on the eve of Saturday’s general election in the Irish republic.

He denies the murder of 22 people aged between eight and 51, as well as attempted murder and conspiring with his brother to cause explosions., The jury was shown chilling CCTV footage of Salman’s movements as he rented a flat in the city centre, dragged bomb-making equipment into the flat in a large blue suitcase, bought shrapnel for the bomb, and carried out a reconnaissance mission to the Manchester Arena before finally detonating the bomb at just after 10.30pm on 22 May 2017., Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, said the email was created to buy hydrogen peroxide, a key ingredient for the bomb, on 20 March 2017., At the same time, the siblings were using a network of unsuspecting family and friends in the Libyan community to buy other ingredients, including large amounts of sulphuric acid, the court heard., Within an hour of Abedi allegedly failing to purchase 10 litres of sulphuric acid using a friend’s details, his mobile phone and car data were pinpointed in the vicinity of Hulme market, in the south of the city, Penny said. Minutes later the email account was created via publicly available wifi., “Much later, on 3 April 2017, this email address was provided to Amazon for the purchase of 30 litres of hydrogen peroxide,” the prosecutor said., After the bombing, when the brothers’ family home was raided by police, they found the email address handwritten on torn-up pieces of paper in a bin outside, the court heard., Penny said the email was used to make two purchases of hydrogen peroxide, one two days after the email was created and another 13 days later. Both orders were delivered to an empty terraced house belonging to a Libyan acquaintance of the siblings in Rusholme., The court heard that the brothers asked a network of acquaintances, mainly friends and cousins, to purchase two chemicals needed for the production of the homemade explosives. Some friends declined, but others, who believed their cover story that they needed the chemicals for a battery at their parents’ home in Libya, agreed., However, a month before the attack, the brothers, by now having built up a stockpile of chemicals at two addresses in south Manchester, would be forced to hurriedly move the bomb-making ingredients, the court heard, On 6 April 2017 the siblings’ parents, Ramadan and Samia, arrived in the UK for a brief visit and the pair were told they would be returning to Libya on one-way tickets in a matter of days on plane tickets bought by their older brother, Ismail., Given their impending departure and fearing that their plans were about to be foiled, the brothers could no longer use various addresses to store the materials for their explosives, the court heard., “They needed to remove the materials quickly to a safe location, where they could be stored unobtrusively without drawing too much attention to themselves and before they were obliged to return to Libya with their parents,” said Penny., Just 48 hours before their departure, they made a late-night purchase of a white Nissan Micra. The car was subsequently parked at a car park near the siblings’ home, and the pair transferred chemicals and shrapnel to the car. Just hours later, the pair departed for Libya with their parents, the court heard., The brothers took the precaution of leaving one of the addresses – Somerton Court – by separate means of transport and with “no small degree of subterfuge”, Penny said., “The last thing they would have wanted would be for the two of them to be stopped together in the early hours of the morning in the Micra, an uninsured vehicle, which just happened to be full of bomb-making equipment. One way or another, they needed to reduce the risk of the entire operation being compromised.”, On his return from Libya, all Salman needed to do was collect what he needed from the Micra … source some parts necessary to make the bomb viable, and find somewhere suitable both to construct it and to detonate it,” said Penny., Abedi denies the charges.

He soon became secretary of the Newcastle upon Tyne North constituency party and held various posts over the years., Even from his early involvement with the party he believed that socialism and enviromentalism went together, and in 1973 the New Scientist magazine’s account of the Labour conference reported that: “Steve Cohen, a young delegate from Newcastle North, demanded fiscal incentives for recycling.” He helped to found the Socialist Environment and Resources Association at the same conference. , I first met Steve when I stood to be the Labour parliamentary candidate for the Newcastle Central constituency in 2009. I did not have high hopes of being selected, but Steve made sure it was a truly open and inclusive process – and I won. As constituency secretary he dedicated many hours of his life to the party, and his intimate knowledge of elections and Labour politics going back five decades meant that no situation fazed him. He was warm and generous, private and open, humane and sardonic., Steve was born in Manchester, the third of four sons of Manc Cohen, a pharmacist and optician, and his wife, Betty (nee Seidman), also a pharmacist. After attending Ducie Technical high school for boys in the city he studied to be an optician on a three-year full-time BSc course at Bradford University (1967-70), then moved straight to Newcastle to work for the Co-Op Eye Care group, continuing to work with the company after 2001, when it was sold to Optical Express. He retired in 2017., Apart from his constituency work, Steve was for some time a Labour councillor on Tyne and Wear county council. Until his death he continued to work largely behind the scenes for the party in Newcastle, including at the last general election. I will particularly miss his advice, often delivered with dry humour., Steve suffered greatly from psoriasis but never complained: “Pain is a social construct,” he said. But he did engage with new treatments such as immunotherapy, both to help himself and to push forward medical knowledge., He was a kind, generous, hard- working man who, although always busy, was able to make time for friends and for anyone who needed his advice. He liked nothing more than to have a meal with Labour colleagues after a party meeting, and also enjoyed walking as part of the Newcastle Red Rambles group.

They escorted him from his seat, where he was identified at this stage by three witnesses.”, One of the witnesses, the court heard, saw Smith making monkey gestures and then launch an “astonishing quantity” of spittle from the stand’s top tier towards visiting supporters in the lower tier., Smith, of Beech Road, Kingswinford, near Dudley, was interviewed by police on 1 November at Wolverhampton police station, where he told officers he had “no ongoing feud” with other Wolves supporters., He also told police he was frustrated with the scoreline and had stood up and sworn during the game, but had only “raised his arms in an upwards direction” in order to motivate the Wolves players., Two witnesses gave evidence to magistrates from behind a screen protecting them from being identified, with one saying he did not believe it was possible that Smith was simply pointing at the pitch., The man told the court: “The Chelsea player that scored happened to be black and he celebrated in front of the Chelsea fans who were below us., “As he did that, I noticed a gentleman stood up and curled his fists under his armpits in a chimp-like gesture. It certainly looked as if it was aimed towards the players on the pitch and the goalscorer. I believed it was a racist gesture towards the player.”, Answering questions from his solicitor, David Dorrance, Smith told the court: “When the fourth goal was scored, the white shirt number nine ran over to the side and stood on top of the electronic advertising board., “The CCTV shows at that point I stood up. There was a reaction to the provocation, but it wasn’t a monkey gesture.”, The court was told that Smith’s mother, also a season ticket holder, was “blameless” during the incident, but no longer attended matches., Magistrates deliberated for around an hour before convicting Smith of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, and a racially aggravated count of the same offence., Passing sentence, the chairman of the bench, Arthur Wheldon, told Smith he would have to serve a four-year football banning order. The magistrates told Smith: “We have heard from two crown prosecution witnesses who had a clear view of you. Both witnesses were adamant as to their recollection., “The court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in a heightened state of agitation, the defendant spat with force, landing on fellow Wolves supporters. The court is further satisfied you made a deliberately racially aggravated gesture in response to Tammy Abraham’s celebration … in what has been described as a ‘chimp’ motion.”, As well as the football banning order, Smith was fined £800 and ordered to pay £600 in costs and a £50 victim surcharge, a total bill of £1,450.wolves football fan banned after making monkey gestures", "label": 0}, "train-150": {"text": "Grenfell inquiry on hold for 18 days over witness wrangle, Attorney general has been asked to promise witnesses they cannot self-incriminate, The Grenfell Tower inquiry has been delayed again so that the government can decide whether evidence given by professionals and company executives could also be used to mount criminal prosecutions against them., Hearings were first postponed last week and now will not restart until at least 24 February after the inquiry asked the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, to promise those involved in the disastrous refurbishment that what they say under cross-examination will not be used to try to send them to jail., The undertaking was requested by lawyers for corporate witnesses in the public inquiry who were involved in the refurbishment of the west London council block where a blaze claimed 72 lives., They include the cladding contractor, Harley Facades, current and former employees of the main contractor, Rydon, the client, Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, and the architects, Studio E.

You have destroyed your good name, you have destroyed your current career.”, Cardiff crown court was told that Price and her then boyfriend, Jack Tinklin, set off for a camping trip but had argued, and Price had turned the car around to go home., Giving evidence, Tinklin said: “Just after the roundabout, she just had a seizure. Cerys made a funny noise and was slumped over the steering wheel. The car drifted off the road, through the central reservation.”, When police searched Price’s pick-up, they found a tub of tramadol – with just 26 of the 100 tablets left., The court heard the drug is prescription-only in the UK and Price had picked up the pills while on holiday in Mexico., Timothy Evans, prosecuting, said: “Price had consumed an amount of tramadol significantly higher than any therapeutic range. She was in no way fit to drive a car. She was in a drugged-up state., “Price was a graduate-level nurse – she is an intelligent woman – and should have known how dangerous it was for her to drive in that state., “A completely innocent man, simply minding his own business driving along the opposite side of the road, lost his life.”, Price, from Nantyglo, south Wales, denied causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury to Tinklin by dangerous driving but was found guilty., She told the court: “I felt normal while driving and in good spirits.

No one has been chosen to replace him., Rights Watch (UK) fears any new selection process will allow time only for a cursory review of the controversial programme and not be a rigorous examination of its aims or procedures., Prevent has become a toxic brand for many within the Muslim community. By delaying the review, Rights Watch (UK) fears, the Home Office may be running down the clock so that it only delivers a “whitewash”., Counter-terrorism police have placed the non-violent group Extinction Rebellion (XR) on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to the authorities running Prevent, raising further concerns about the focus of the programme., The overwhelming majority of those referred to Prevent end up being dealt with by other agencies. Last year more of those given specialist support in what is known as the “channel” process were suspected of far-right radicalisation – involving 254 cases – than those suspected of Islamist radicalisation – 210 cases., The stated aim of Prevent, which is a voluntary programme, is to divert people from terrorism before they offend. It deals with individuals who have yet to cross the criminality threshold., Yasmine Ahmed, the director of Rights Watch, said “Prevent has involved a massively disproportionate number of people from Muslim communities.”, Part of the problem, she added, was because “the government has an incredibly vague definition of extremism which allows the government to catch a whole range of people who may be legitimately questioning government policy., “There are a range of different de-radicalisation projects elsewhere, such as the Aarhaus model in Denmark that are more developed. We should look at how other countries are dealing with this.”, A letter before court action has been sent to the Home Office by Leigh Day, lawyers acting for Rights Watch (UK), which declares: “Parliament envisaged that the independent review would involve consultation with affected individuals and communities, as well as with the various civil society groups and organisations involved in the debate concerning the Prevent Strategy., “It also envisaged a thorough and effective review of Prevent … and the concerns expressed about it. The delayed appointment of the independent reviewer reduces the likelihood that that will occur either at all, or with sufficient rigour.”, In response to an urgent parliamentary question last month by Diane Abbott, Labour’s home affairs spokesperson, the security minister, Brandon Lewis, said: “The statutory deadline for the review to be completed and its findings shared remains 12 August 2020. The next steps are being considered right now and will be announced in due course.”, The Home Office confirmed it had received the letter from Rights Watch (UK) and will respond.government to be challenged in court over prevent reviewer", "label": 0}, "train-154": {"text": "\nRishi Sunak plans to raise £3bn by scrapping 'entrepreneurs' relief'\n, Chancellor seeks spending room by axing relief on capital gains when a business is sold, \nJasper Jolly, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 13.18 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 1 Mar 2020 16.10 EST\n\n, The chancellor is planning to scrap a £3bn tax relief that mainly benefits the wealthy in a bid to raise cash for an expected increase in public spending in the budget on 11 March., Rishi Sunak is expected to target entrepreneurs’ relief, a tax break which halves the capital gains tax paid when people sell their businesses. Under current rules, sellers pay only 10% on lifetime gains of up to £10m, comparedwith the 20% capital gains tax paid by higher-rate taxpayers., Scrapping the relief would give Sunak extra room for manoeuvre in a budget that is expected to include expensive pledges such as an increase in spending on railways and electric car chargers., The relief is aimed at incentivising people to create new businesses. It was introduced by Gordon Brown’s Labour government in 2008, and was expanded by the Conservative government after 2010., The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has previously strongly criticised the relief, saying it was not well targeted and that it caused distortions in the tax system., The IFS said last week that scrapping it would make the tax system “more equitable and more efficient”. It said 5,000 individuals made an average tax saving of £350,000 in 2017–18 tax year – meaning they gained three-quarters of the £2.3bn cost of the relief. The Resolution Foundation last month said £3bn could be raised by scrapping it., “There are plenty of tax rises which would both raise revenue from better off individuals and improve the coherence of the tax system,” said Paul Johnson, director at the IFS. “Top of the list should be the abolition of the misleadingly named entrepreneurs’ relief.”, However, the plans to scrap it have alarmed some business groups. Mike Cherry, the national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said scrapping the relief would make “everyday entrepreneurs” poorer., “Only around 10% of people who claim this relief are selling businesses worth more than £1m. The vast majority of those who benefit from this incentive – 38,000 each year – are everyday entrepreneurs.”, The Treasury declined to comment.rishi sunak plans to raise 3bn by scrapping entrepreneurs relief", "label": 0}, "train-155": {"text": "\nMan left in deportation cell for four days with broken ankle\n, Home Office contractors involved in deportation flight too busy to take him to hospital, \nDiane Taylor, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 11.47 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 1 Mar 2020 13.48 EST\n\n, A man was left in a cell in “excruciating agony” for four days with a broken ankle after Home Office contractors involved in a deportation charter flight were too busy to take him to hospital, the Guardian has learned., Lionel Shaw, 33, is a partially blind and partially deaf Jamaican man who has lived in the UK for 18 years, arriving in Britain at the age of 15., He was arrested and placed in Harmondsworth immigration removal centre near Heathrow last month. The Home Office planned to deport him to Jamaica for overstaying. He has no criminal convictions., On Monday 24 February, he slipped on a wet floor and fell to the ground. Medical notes from the detention centre, seen by the Guardian, state after Shaw slipped and fell: “no injuries or bleeding observed”. Painkillers and ice were advised, along with rest, ankle exercises and urine bottles because he was unable to walk to the toilet., A later medical note on 26 February states: “I have tried to arrange for the patient to go to the hospital for the X-ray as requested by the GP. Unfortunately the contractor is not able to provide the necessary escorting staff this afternoon due to a planned charter flight.”, Speaking from his hospital bed at Hillingdon hospital, Shaw, 33, told the Guardian he slipped and fell on a wet floor at the detention centre after officers asked detainees to leave their cells for a room search., “I slipped and it got my right foot. It happened right in front of the officers. They could see I was in very bad pain but they told me my ankle wasn’t broken. I asked them to call an ambulance for me but they didn’t do it., “I was left in Harmondsworth in bed in my cell for four days. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t wash or change my clothes because the pain was so terrible. I had to rely on urine bottles and food other detainees brought to my cell. I couldn’t walk to go and press the bell to get assistance. Now that they’ve finally brought me to hospital I have two guards by my bedside., “The officers in Harmondsworth made me feel less than human. I was forced to wet myself because I could not move from the bed,” he said., He said that on Thursday detention centre staff said they would take him to hospital by car but he said he could not move his leg so would not be able to get into a car., “At that point I thought I might die so I called the police and asked them to get me an ambulance.”, He said doctors at Hillingdon hospital were due to carry out surgery on his broken ankle on Monday, which they estimate will take four hours., “The doctors have told me it might be a year or more before I can walk properly again,” he said. “When I finally arrived at the hospital on Thursday 27 February by ambulance the doctors asked them why I had waited so long to come to hospital. I told them it was not my decision.”, A Change.org petition has been launched to free Shaw from detention and ensure he gets appropriate medical treatment., Maria Thomas, from Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is representing Shaw, expressed concern about his treatment. She said: “We are deeply concerned about the delay in transferring our client to hospital in light of reports that he sustained multiple fractures in his ankle after a fall in the detention centre and was left in excruciating agony and unable to get out of bed for nearly four days.”, Karen Doyle from Movement For Justice, who has been supporting Shaw said: “Like the Windrush scandal, Lionel’s case proves that the Home Office and their contractors prioritise charter flights and deportation targets over human lives.”, A Home Office spokesperson said: “The welfare of those in detention is of paramount importance and it is crucial that detention is carried out with dignity and respect.The provision of 24-hour, seven-days-a-week healthcare in all immigration removal centres ensures that individuals held there have ready access to medical professionals and levels of primary care in line with individuals in the community.”, The Home Office contractor at Harmondsworth, Mitie, has secured a new three-year contract to provide security services to the Home Office, beginning on 1 April. Mitie has declined to comment., A spokesperson for Central North West London NHS Foundation Trust, who provide healthcare at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre, said: “We are sorry for Mr Shaw’s distress and share the concern about delays. Healthcare provide help within the IRC and staff have no power to take people out of the IRC (the IRC’s Care and Custody Team make those arrangements)., “Mr Shaw was seen immediately by healthcare staff after the fall but staff were unsure about the extent of his ankle injury; he was given analgesia, his leg elevated and kept under review., “The following day he was seen by the GP who recommended an x-ray.The IRC’s care and custody team were unable to take him so he was given more analgesia and a registered nurse kept him under review. The care and custody team took him for an x-ray on Thursday. We have no further update on Mr Shaw’s injury.”, i thought i might die man left in cell for four days with broken ankle", "label": 0}, "train-156": {"text": "\nStorm Jorge brings further disruption to UK areas already hit by flooding – video\n, Storm Jorge brought winds of up to 70mph and torrential downpours to the UK over the weekend, bringing the country's wettest February on record to an end, Source: As credited, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 10.32 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 03.04 EST\n\nstorm jorge brings further disruption to uk areas already hit by flooding video", "label": 0}, "train-157": {"text": "\nStorm Jorge disruption continues after wettest UK February on record\n, Severe weather warnings are downgraded but certain areas remain flooded, \nAmy Walker, \n\nSun 1 Mar 2020 09.04 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Sun 1 Mar 2020 13.45 EST\n\n, Flood-hit areas have experienced further disruption after Storm Jorge battered the UK with strong winds and heavy downpours., The latest bout of extreme weather comes after the country experienced the wettest February since records began., Data from the Met Office shows that an average of 202.1mm of rainfall fell last month, surpassing records for February 1990 when 193.4mm fell. By lunchtime on Sunday, 84 flood warnings remained in place across England, including many in east Yorkshire., In Snaith, where residents were evacuated from their homes earlier in the week, the Environment Agency has deployed a further four pumps in addition to the 18 already installed to reduce flooding in the town., East Riding council has urged residents living in affected areas to “remain vigilant” as the deluge continues, although there were no evacuations in the region for the first night since flooding started., Overwhelmed flood barriers at Ironbridge in Shropshire, which also led to an emergency evacuation, were fixed on Friday, while a severe weather warning – meaning danger to life – was also downgraded., On Sunday, the Environment Agency reported that water levels in the area were rising again and were expected to peak between 5.4 and 5.7 metres on Monday afternoon. Telford and Wrekin council said levels would hopefully be at least a metre lower than last week, while more local businesses were reopening., On Saturday, when many yellow Met Office warnings for rain remained in place, several flooded roads were closed in Wiltshire and people were rescued from cars stranded in both Devon and Somerset., The area surrounding the River Ouse, along which some flood warnings remained in place on Sunday, was also temporarily closed to high-sided vehicles in Humberside as winds reached up to 70mph., In south Wales, police declared a critical incident during Britain’s fourth weekend of downpours, with Pontypridd and the Ely area of Cardiff among the worst affected areas., Residents were advised to stay indoors to avoid winds of up to 70mph and were told water levels could rise further, but the incident was no longer in place by mid-morning on Saturday., A number of flights were diverted to Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic because of high winds across the island, while a lorry overturned as winds battered the N59 in Galway., On Sunday, only one yellow weather warning for snow was in place across parts of Scotland, while ice is expected to form overnight in north-western England and Scotland, bringing disruption to commuters on Monday morning., National Rail said many services were still disrupted because of damage caused by the storm.

Johnson also believes steep stock market falls last week could knock capital gains tax receipts and depress the revenue the government was expecting from stamp duty on share buying. “There is also going to be a hit to growth,” he said., Writing in today’s Observer, former Treasury minister and Tory MP David Gauke said the budget would have to be recast at a late stage to take into account the unpredictable economic outlook., “Given the uncertainties, the OBR is likely to qualify its economic forecasts,” Gauke writes. “This does not make the task of the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, any easier. He will be delivering his budget just four weeks after being appointed, with a powerful No 10 apparently indifferent to keeping control of the public finances, in a government that is pursuing a growth-damaging Brexit policy and in the midst of a health crisis that makes all short-term economic forecasts a matter of guesswork. It is quite a baptism of fire.”, Stewart Wood, who worked on six budgets when serving as an adviser to Gordon Brown, said the timing of last week’s market meltdown created a planning nightmare for the Treasury., Lord Wood said: “With 10 days to go, the OBR’s forecasts and spending envelope will normally have been locked down by now. The Treasury may have to rip up the plans its budget has been based on and hastily assemble a new plan B, to ensure the chancellor’s statement on 11 March fits the situation we are in, rather than the situation we would have been in before the Corona crash.”, In a newspaper interview Javid said he had been planning an income-tax cut and a network of electric car-charging stations for inclusion in the budget. Sunak will also be under pressure from Downing Street to deliver on the Tories’ post-election promises to “level up” the country., Local government leaders and charities are also calling on the Treasury to provide urgent funding for adult social care services across England. According to Age UK, between 2010 to 2019 spending on adult social care services fell by £86m in real terms, representing a 4% cut in local authority spending. Age UK estimates that hospitals delaying discharges of elderly people, due to a lack of social care, cost the NHS £500 every minute., Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the all-party business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said Sunak should deliver a bold budget amid the uncertainty. She said: “The coronavirus, flooding, Brexit and warnings about a big hit to economic growth have put businesses and households under huge pressure. But now is not the moment for a safety-first budget., “The chancellor must not use this uncertainty as an excuse to further delay the investment that the north and our public services so badly need.

After years of campaigning against a miscarriage of justice, the four were freed at the Old Bailey in 1989., In the Name of the Son opens at Belfast Lyric theatre on 17 March and will also be staged later this year at the Edinburgh festival. It is based on the book of the same title by former IRA prisoner Richard O’Rawe and follows Conlon’s life after he walked out of London’s Old Bailey a free man in 1989 until he died of cancer in 2014 at 60. O’Rawe, who wrote the play with Belfast playwright Martin Lynch, said the experience of dramatising Conlon’s life after 15 years in jail was “one of the hardest things I have ever had to do”., He added: “I had known Gerry since we were kids playing cowboys and indians in the streets off the Falls Road. So it was draining and deeply emotional at times, recreating scenes which showed Gerry’s dark times., “But this is also a story of redemption, of how Gerry got out of the pit of drug addiction and rebuilt his life … and how he used the rest of that life to campaign for others suffering miscarriages of justice as well as his battle against the death penalty., “When I read the final script I felt as if I could hear Gerry’s voice again speaking to me. There is no sentimentality in the drama but there are plenty of laughs as well as it being a tribute.”, The Oscars scenes are based on events in 1994 when Conlon travelled to Hollywood. In The Name of The Father, a film based on the story of the Guildford Four, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as Conlon, was up for a string of nominations. Bored with the ceremony, Conlon and friends from Ireland barricaded themselves into a toilet for a party, joking with stars who came in to relieve themselves“Gerry offered coke to Jack Nicholson, who politely declined, and later sang Hungry Heart with Bruce Springsteen,” O’Rawe said., Actor Shaun Blaney recreates this and other scenes by switching between Conlon’s voice and other characters., Lynch said he also found the experience of concentrating Conlon’s years of freedom into a one-man show emotionally draining. He compared it to writing Chronicles of Long Kesh, his play about republican and loyalist prisoners in the H Blocks between 1971 and 1994., “That was a challenging process because it touched on times such as the hunger strikes and had characters that I had known in real life. But I have to say that In the Name of the Son was even more challenging because it is one man’s struggle towards redemption,” Lynch said., “I know some of his family will attend the show when it opens after St.Patrick’s Day, and I hope they will see that Richard and I have done justice to Gerry and his story.”gerry conlon life after guildford four play", "label": 0}, "train-160": {"text": "\nBeating Covid-19?

For the purposes of forecasting the outlook for the British economy, this is not the best of times., Brexit uncertainty continues in that the negotiations on our future relationship with the EU are only just beginning. It is not obvious that any deal will be reached but, even if it is, the deal will be pretty thin. The economic consequences of such an outcome are disputed, in the sense that the vast majority of economists view this as a bad outcome for the economy and the government apparently doesn’t., Thankfully for the credibility of our economic forecasts, we have an independent body of experts – the Office for Budget Responsibility – to make these forecasts. It was notable that the former chancellor, Sajid Javid, felt the need to defend the importance of the OBR in his resignation statement last week., The OBR has known for some time that it would have to address the sensitive issue of Brexit in its March 2020 forecasts. It now faces the further challenge of addressing the economic impact of the coronavirus., This is particularly difficult to predict because much will depend upon the virus itself. We do not know with great confidence how quickly Covid-19 will spread, what the mortality rates will be in advanced economies, whether there will be advances in treatment and if warmer, spring weather will see it off., As for the economic consequences, to what extent will supply chains be hit? How many people will be absent from work (because they are ill, self-isolating or caring for others)? How much will a negative story dominating the news for the weeks ahead dent consumer confidence?, The impact is likely to be significant and immediate, albeit followed perhaps by a strong recovery with little lasting harm done to the economy. But a fall in GDP of 3% (which is the estimate made by a 2016 European Commission study of the impact of a pandemic on European growth) would be painful. Such a fall in GDP is more than half the size of the financial crisis contraction., Given the uncertainties, the OBR is likely to qualify its economic forecasts. This does not make the task of the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, any easier. He will be delivering his budget just four weeks after being appointed, with a powerful No 10 apparently indifferent to keeping control of the public finances, in a government that is pursuing a growth-damaging Brexit policy and in the midst of a health crisis that makes all short-term economic forecasts a matter of guesswork. It is quite a baptism of fire., If there is a substantial reduction in consumer confidence, there will be those who argue for a short-term fiscal stimulus. The Treasury will, I suspect, urge caution. The problems may be as much to do with supply as demand; fiscal tools can take a while to implement (a short-term cut in VAT probably being the immediate lever to pull) for an issue that might be relatively short term; and action can give the impression of panic, which would be self-defeating., In these turbulent circumstances, the chancellor would be entitled to take a cautious approach in his first budget. He will have a chance to get the wheels in motion for the increases in infrastructure spending due over the course of the parliament but, in an uncertain world, it would make sense for the autumn budget to be the big fiscal event of 2020., David Gauke is a former treasury ministercoronavirus new chancellor first budget brexit", "label": 0}, "train-161": {"text": "\nUK knife crime: two dead after stabbings in Coventry and London\n, Boy, 16, found collapsed in Coventry street after house party, while man in his 20s died in Hendon, Barnet, in the capital, Press Association, \n\nSat 29 Feb 2020 21.54 EST\n\n, A 16-year-old boy has died in hospital after being stabbed in Coventry.

Its plastic-filled aluminium cladding, which the inquiry heard would prevent it from seeming like a “poor cousin” to a new school constructed next door, has already been identified as the main cause of fire spread., Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, told the hearing in Paddington that Studio E’s selection after designing the neighbouring Kensington Aldridge academy was “cheap, convenient, quick, even though Grenfell Tower was a completely different kind of project with different challenges”., Under cross-examination, Kuszell confirmed his team “was not experienced in overcladding a residential tower block” and that the Kensington and Chelsea Tenants Management Organisation (TMO), the building’s landlord and project client, “knew exactly what our skill set was”., The inquiry also heard that Neil Crawford, who had day-to-day management of the Grenfell project for the practice, was not fully qualified as an architect because he had not completed his professional qualification. Bruce Sounes, another senior architect on the job, said he had not worked on a high-rise building and had no experience with polyethylene composite materials as a working architect., He said he did not think Studio E would have qualified for the job in a bid process, because of a lack of relevant experience., The counsel to the inquiry put it to him that Studio E might have been in financial difficulties when it took the job, and asked: “Was it the case that Studio E was eager to retain lucrative projects despite not having the expertise?”, Sounes replied: “That’s an unfair question… if a project comes along and there is no reason for you not to do it, you will do it.”, Internal project emails released for the first time also revealed that early budgets were considered too low by the architects and that the fee they were being offered of no more than £99,000 – kept low to avoid putting the contract out to tender under public procurement rules – would not cover all the work they needed to do., Sounes, Studio E’s project architect on the works, was also worried about the approach being taken by the TMO, describing its ideas for early design changes as like “headless chickens, a chaotic mess” in one email and warning Kuszell in another that the project was was being treated like a “poor relative”., Jane Trethewey, the housing strategy and regeneration manager at RBKC, said in another email that Grenfell Tower was “one of its worst property assets” and recladding would “prevent it looking like a poor cousin to the brand new facility being developed next door”., Kuszell told the inquiry: “I believe that we had the processes and experience of complex buildings to be able to undertake this commission. But it was clear that there would be a need for CPD continuing professional development and research around the project.”, Earlier, the inquiry was halted within minutes of its restart when community activists stood up when the architect started to give evidence and angrily shouted that it was “a cover-up”., Jonty Leff, 42, and Scott Dore, 40, shouted at the chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, that the inquiry was a “disgrace” because witnesses who worked for some of the companies involved in the works had been assured by the attorney general that their evidence would not be used in criminal prosecutions against them., The hearing descended into confusion when the two men complained that this assurance had not been given to firefighters who gave evidence at an earlier stage of the inquiry in 2018., “You are giving them different treatment,” shouted Leff, who later described himself as a political activist. “You should shut them down.” Dore said he lived in west London near the tower., Moore-Bick halted proceedings and ordered Leff and Dore to be removed. They refused, and the bereaved and survivors remonstrated with them in the room for several minutes., Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle, Hesham Rahman, died in the fire, said: “There are bereaved and survivors who want to listen.”, Willie Thompson, another survivor, shouted at the pair to get out. They were approached by Stuart Cundy, the lead officer in the Metropolitan police investigation into the disaster, and after a few minutes they agreed to leave., Moore-Bick had just explained that the undertaking by the attorney general meant that “no one will be able to justify refusing to answer questions on the grounds that to do so would or might expose him or herself personally to a risk of prosecution”., Speaking outside the hearing, Leff said his protest was triggered by the attorney general’s decision the previous week., The Metropolitan police are investigating possible crimes including gross negligence manslaughter, which can attract lengthy prison terms. The force has said it is gathering its own evidence and is not relying on the inquiry., “It’s one rule for them and one rule for the firefighters,” said Leff. “It means the firefighters were hung out to dry. It’s a whitewash. It means the inquiry is a whitewash.”, Dore added: “I am here to speak up for the families who lost their loved ones.”grenfell tower inquiry halted by protesters calling it a cover up", "label": 0}, "train-164": {"text": "\n'Gross failures' contributed to man's death in immigration centre\n, Prince Fosu, 31, died of hypothermia, dehydration and malnutrition in cell, \nDiane Taylor, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 13.14 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 2 Mar 2020 11.10 EST\n\n, Neglect and a series of gross failures by the Home Office and other agencies contributed to the death of a vulnerable Ghanaian man from hypothermia, dehydration and malnutrition, an inquest jury has found., In a damning narrative conclusion, the jury found that Prince Fosu, a car parts dealer, had died suddenly after developing these conditions while he was suffering from psychotic illness., The jury criticised many aspects of the healthcare systems in Harmondsworth immigration removal centre (IRC) at the time of Fosu’s death and said there were “gross failures across all the agencies”., They found that Home Office staff failed to spot and respond to Fosu’s deteriorating condition and failed to monitor their contractors adequately., Speaking after the inquest, Fosu’s father, Prince Obeng, welcomed the jury’s conclusions. “The jury have done their job,” he said. However, he added, “everyone at every level at Harmondsworth” had failed his son., Fosu, 31, from Ghana, died at Harmondsworth IRC near Heathrow on 30 October 2012. After six days in segregation, he was found naked and without bedding in a cell peppered with debris. He had been suffering from psychosis. Malnutrition, dehydration and hypothermia contributed to his death., Checks on his wellbeing every 15 minutes at Harmondsworth showed no evidence that he had eaten, drunk or slept over his six days there., He was seen lying naked on a cold concrete floor, in unsanitary conditions, behaving “bizarrely”, not communicating with anyone and with no bedding or mattress., During the inquest hearing, a member of the Independent Monitoring Board, Tony Smith, told the jury: “Mr Fosu died in plain sight. We let him down big time.”,  As well as the IMB, other interested parties in the case before the coroner Chinyere Inyama included the Home Office, contractors Mitie and GEO, and the chief constable of Northampton police. Three doctors, Wesley Joseph, Anna Sharif and Kirpal Singh, face a review of the way they cared for Fosu by the General Medical Council., The jury criticised GEO for removing Fosu’s mattress and bedding when they held him in segregation, saying it was indicative of a “casual approach” to his welfare. Doctors showed insufficient professional curiosity about his condition and the IMB failed to monitor the situation effectively, they added., The jury found that control points put in place to protect vulnerable detainees were grossly ineffective., Fosu entered the UK on a valid business visitor visa. He was then refused leave to remain on entry but appealed. He was booked on a flight to leave Britain on 5 November 2012., On 21 October, he was arrested as he ran down the road naked in Kettering and was detained in Corby police station for three days. A check on his immigration status found he had overstayed his visa. Despite police officers’ concerns, a mental health assessment in Corby police station concluded Fosu was fit to be detained and on 24 October 2012 he was transferred to Harmondsworth IRC., In detention Fosu was found ranting into a mirror. He was then restrained and put into segregation shortly after his arrival where he remained until his death six days later., During the period of segregation he lost 15% of his body weight, going from 55kg (8st 9lb) to 47kg (7st 6lb). He was found to have died of cardiovascular collapse with psychosis, malnutrition and hypothermia., Prince Fosu’s father, Prince Obeng, said his son was a quiet and obedient man who had never previously experienced comparable episodes of ill health. “I never knew that things like this could happen in Europe,” he said. “The Home Office has not been in touch with me but I would like them to apologise for their failure to protect Prince.”, He criticised the time it had taken for the inquest to be held: “When Prince came to the UK for a visit his daughter was just one year old. Now she is eight.”, The prisons and probation ombudsman (PPO) recommended the Home Office refer three doctors to the General Medical Council., Sue McAllister also recommended that the Home Office investigate the actions of Home Office staff who were responsible for monitoring Fosu’s care in the segregation unit and that disciplinary action should be considered., McAllister said: “I very much regret that the lengthy delay will inevitably diminish the impact of this (PPO) report and make it more difficult to hold those involved properly to account., “This is a very troubling case. Mr Fosu spent six days at Harmondsworth, and apart from his first few hours, he spent his time segregated, living naked in a room dirty with faeces, urine and uneaten food, without a mattress or bedding. He did not eat for much of this time and rarely engaged with staff., “I am particularly troubled that Mr Fosu lived in an unfurnished room without proper justification or review, which I consider to be inhuman and degrading. I consider that IRC managers were responsible for a culture which I can only describe as uncaring.”, The PPO acknowledged that managing Fosu’s complex and difficult behaviour presented staff at Harmondsworth with challenges. However, she added: “We consider that the care he received fell considerably below acceptable standards.”, A Home Office spokesperson said: “The standard of care Mr Fosu received was unacceptable, and we must never allow this to happen again., “Since Mr Fosu’s death we have increased the number of staff in immigration removal centres, improved how detainees are managed and safeguarded, including the introduction of the Adults at Risk policy and increased monitoring of vulnerable people in detention.” gross failures contributed to mans death in immigration centre", "label": 0}, "train-165": {"text": "\nWoman who posed as man on gay dating app jailed for stalking\n, Yannick Glaudin sentenced over ‘disturbing’ harassment of man she met on Grindr, PA Media, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 11.59 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 12.19 EST\n\n, A woman has been jailed for posing as a man on a gay dating app and sharing sexual photos and videos of a man she met online during a “disturbing campaign of harassment”., Yannick Glaudin, 31, stalked the man and his then boyfriend, sending their families, friends and colleagues the intimate pictures and films using a number of fake identities, Inner London crown court was told., Police and Crimestoppers were contacted on multiple occasions over false claims, including of assault and paedophilia, against one man, while his friends were warned he had a “bounty on his head”., Glaudin, who had evaded justice for more than a year after fleeing to her native France, admitted to her crimes. She was sentenced to 13 months in prison on Monday., The judge, Silas Reid, said Glaudin was driven by revenge after her initial victim broke off contact. He described her behaviour as “designed to cause maximum upset”., John McNamara, prosecuting, told the court that in May 2017, Glaudin, using the pseudonym Steven St Pier, met her first male victim via Grindr. The pair exchanged phone numbers, email addresses and even the victim’s CV as he was job hunting., “During the period of contact, the victim sent to the defendant a number of intimate and personal pictures and videos,” McNamara said., But the victim had doubts over Glaudin’s true identity and ended their online-only contact in December 2017. This triggered months of harassment, beginning with the defendant sending the sexual images to his stepfather, friends and friends of friends., Glaudin, who worked as a construction draftsman and chef, escalated the harassment from February 2018, when her victim started a relationship with another man., The now ex-boyfriend’s friends were contacted by Glaudin, using pseudonyms such as Harry Wars and Nick Guel on Facebook and Instagram, who made false allegations about him., In March 2018, a false report was made to Crimestoppers claiming the boyfriend had been abusing a young boy and was linked to a known prostitute, McNamara said., On another date, a fake report was made to police pretending to be from a victim’s boss, “stating that he had seen videos of underage sex on a laptop”, the prosecutor said., Other messages suggested there was “a price” of €1,000 on the boyfriend’s head in Barcelona and London. Photos of the first victim using the London underground were also emailed to him., Meanwhile, several men “looking for sex” tried to visit their then shared flat after being in contact with someone using the first victim’s name, the court heard., Speaking at the court in south-east London, the former boyfriend said the experience had been “hell”., “I suffered the extreme shock of constant, insidious daily harassment at home, work and on every online channel I was registered on, by someone completely anonymous, using multiple aliases,” he said., “The perpetrator has accused me personally of being a paedophile, impersonated me and my partner online via dating applications, sent multiple strangers to my home demanding anonymous sex, followed me … home, and taken photographs of our front door and taunted us about it.”, The court heard that after pleading guilty to her offences in July 2018, Glaudin fled to France. A European arrest warrant was later issued. She was extradited in January and Metropolitan police officers crossed the Channel to bring her into custody., Representing Glaudin, Ricky Yau said the defendant had returned to France to visit two terminally ill relatives. Yau said she believed: “What I’ve done to them is nasty, cruel and stupid and I regret it.”, The judge questioned why Glaudin had not faced more serious charges than those put by the prosecution. “It’s difficult to understand why you did what you did, other than that during the period of your offending you were consumed by jealousy and a desire for revenge,” he told her during sentencing., During her “disturbing campaign of harassment” Glaudin ignored pleas from her victims to stop and use fake social media accounts to “inveigle” her way into their circle of friends to track their lives, Reid said., Glaudin, who has no previous convictions, was sentenced to 12 months for a charge of disclosing private sexual photos and films with intent to cause distress, four months for one count of harassment without violence and four months for one of stalking without fear, alarm or distress., These will be served concurrently, with a further one month sentence for breaching bail to be served consecutively., Glaudin is also subject to a lifelong restraining order preventing her from contacting her victims and other individuals connected to the case.woman yannick glaudin posed man gay dating app grindr jailed stalking", "label": 0}, "train-166": {"text": "\nMan fired air pistol at police before being shot dead, inquest hears\n, Spencer Ashworth fatally wounded in 2017 by Avon and Somerset officers near M5 outside Bristol, \nSteven Morris and agency, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 10.39 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 3 Mar 2020 06.20 EST\n\n, A man was shot dead by four armed police officers after firing an air pistol at one of them, an inquest heard., Shortly before the incident, Spencer Ashworth told a relative he had a “new James Bond air pistol” and said he wanted to move to the US., Ashworth, 29, a part-time courier, was fatally wounded by Avon and Somerset police officers near the M5 outside Bristol on the morning of 27 September 2017., He had been driving south on the motorway when police received reports of a man shooting what appeared to be a gun out of his car window. Firearms officers stopped Ashworth, who was driving alone in a red Suzuki Swift, and surrounded his car., Maria Voisin, the senior coroner for Avon, told jurors at Avon coroner’s court: “Officers shouted instructions for Spencer Ashworth to leave the vehicle and place his hands where they could be seen., “It seems the deceased did not comply. He could be seen to raise a gun in his right hand and fired what is now known to have been an air pistol at one of the attending officers. Four of the five officers returned fire, discharging 15 rounds at Mr Ashworth.”, In a statement, Ashworth’s mother, Yvonne Maunder, said her son became insular in his late teens and would play computer games in his bedroom alone. “He thought everyone hated him,” said Maunder. “He showed all the signs of depression.”, Ashworth moved out of his family home aged 22 to live in Plymouth, Bristol and then Portishead. He spent a lot of time playing computer games such as Grand Theft Auto and Resident Evil, the inquest heard., In an email sent to his mother in August 2017, Ashworth referred to “my new James Bond air pistol” and said he had wanted to go to California “before I have to shoot it out with the police”., His housemate in Portishead, Justin Baber, said: “His hobbies were skate-boarding and playing games on his Xbox. He would play shooting games like Call Of Duty.”, Baber said their landlord, Chris Jones, had to tell Ashworth to use his Xbox in his room as he was spending “days or weeks playing on it” in the communal lounge., Janice Hawley, a probation manager, met with Ashworth in 2016 as part of a sentence he received for assault., She told the inquest she suspected there was “something else going on” with Ashworth and had suspicions he may have been on the autistic spectrum. “He was quite adamant there was nothing wrong,” she said., Insp Adam Crockford of Avon and Somerset police said Ashworth’s record on the police national computer had warning markers for “violence, mental health and suicidal”., The inquest continues. video games fan fired air pistol at police before being shot inquest told spencer ashworth", "label": 0}, "train-167": {"text": "\nStreatham terrorism attack police investigated for 'dangerous driving'\n, Met officers under criminal investigation after police car crashed into two vehicles, \nVikram Dodd Police and crime correspondent, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 09.48 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Mon 2 Mar 2020 05.28 EST\n\n, Two police officers racing to the scene of the Streatham terrorist attack are under criminal investigation after one of their cars crashed into vehicles belonging to the public., The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) issued the notices for alleged dangerous driving, which is a potential criminal offence, and gross misconduct, which is a potential offence under police discipline rules and can be punishable by dismissal., Both are male, armed Metropolitan police officers, who, as a result of the decision by the IOPC, have been placed on restricted duties, meaning they cannot drive., The Metropolitan Police Federation (MPF), the force’s staff association, called the decision a “joke” and said the watchdog should rethink its decision., On 2 February, one officer who was driving an unmarked car was involved in a crash with two vehicles driven by members of the public as he headed to the scene of the stabbing in south London. Two members of the public were injured, the Met said., The other officer, who was driving a marked armed response vehicle and not involved in the collision, also went to the scene., The two police cars were travelling in convoy with flashing blue lights and two-tone sirens when the crash happened, the MPF, representing the men, said., Armed police surveillance officers were monitoring Sudesh Amman, 20,who had recently been released from Belmarsh prison for terrorism offences. It was feared he was so dangerous he could stage an attack., Amman stabbed passersby on Streatham High Road and was shot dead by the surveillance officers; colleagues were called to give assistance., A spokesman for the IOPC said: “We are conducting an independent investigation into a road traffic incident involving a Metropolitan police car which collided with two vehicles while responding to the terror attack in Streatham on Sunday 2 February. Two people received injuries., “On Friday 28 February we served notices of investigation for dangerous driving and gross misconduct on the officer driving the vehicle involved in the collision and on the driver of a marked police vehicle which was in close proximity to the unmarked vehicle but not involved in the collision., “A criminal investigation does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow. Misconduct notices do not imply guilt but are to inform the officer that their behaviour and conduct are under investigation and of the level of severity. Such notices are not judgmental in any way.”, Ken Marsh, the chair of the MPF, said: “The public will be appalled when they hear that brave police officers responding to a terrorist attack can be treated in such a manner. What kind of message does this send? These officers and their colleagues put their lives on the line that day to protect the public. Now potentially their careers are on the line. It’s absurd. A complete joke., “Our colleagues did not know what danger they were travelling towards as the information emerged in real time about stabbings and threats of a suicide vest and explosives. Yet without hesitation they drove towards that danger. Because that’s what police officers do., “And yet now their careers are at risk as the hindsight brigade decide to justify their existence. These people need to understand the split-second and dynamic decisions police officers have to take.”, There has long been tensions between sections of the police and the IOPC. Some officers think investigations take too long, with many kept in limbo for years fearing they could lose their jobs. The watchdog thinks officers exaggerate fears of being persecuted and believes the notices of investigation it issues are necessary to protect officers’ rights., Marsh urged the IOPC to think again. “No one is saying that police officers should not be scrutinised or that their actions should not be accountable,” he said. “But the last thing officers responding to a terrorist attack should be worrying about is whether their prompt response and bravery will put their livelihoods in danger., “We are of course supporting our colleagues at this very difficult time and call on the IOPC to think again about what they are doing and what message their actions send to police officers.”, The Met said: “On Friday 28 February the IOPC served notices of investigation for dangerous driving and gross misconduct on the driver of the vehicle involved in the collision and on the driver of a marked police vehicle. The driver of the marked police vehicle was in close proximity to the unmarked vehicle but not involved in the collision., “The officers have been removed from driving duties pending the outcome of the IOPC investigation. They remain on firearms duties.”, The IOPC investigation into the shooting of Amman continues, with officers being treated as witnesses.met officers investigated dangerous driving streatham terror attack aftermath", "label": 0}, "train-168": {"text": "\nUN predicts above-average temperatures even without El Niño\n, Global warming caused by humans as powerful as weather phenomenon, say experts, PA Media, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 08.37 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 09.54 EST\n\n, Many parts of the world are likely to experience above-average temperatures over the next few months, even without a natural El Niño effect, according to weather experts., The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said the signal from human-induced climate change was now as powerful as the natural phenomenon, which drives warmer temperatures., It said there was a 60% chance of a neutral situation without an El Niño or its opposite, La Niña, between March and May. There was a 35% chance of an El Niño developing and 5% for a La Niña., The El Niño southern oscillation (Enso) is a naturally occurring phenomenon in the Pacific with a warming influence on global temperatures. It is also linked to heavy rain, flooding and drought., Despite the expected absence of an El Niño, the WMO forecasts there will be above-average sea surface temperatures in many parts of the world, which will lead to higher than normal land temperatures. Climate change would contribute to these conditions, the WMO said., The WMO’s secretary general, Petteri Taalas, said: “Even Enso-neutral months are warmer than in the past, as air and sea surface temperatures as well as ocean heat have increased due to climate change., “With more than 90% of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases going into the ocean, ocean heat content is at record levels.

Studio E has already admitted it would not have been selected for the job in competition because it lacked experience in high-rise housing or over-cladding works., Neil Crawford, the Studio E designer who was the day-to-day contact for the contractor, was not a qualified architect, and Sounes, the lead architect, had not worked on a high-rise building and had no experience with polyethylene composite materials as a working architect., The building caught fire on the fourth floor on 14 June 2017 and a blaze spread to the 24th floor in less than half an hour through the cladding system the architects had helped design, ultimately claiming 72 lives. The tenant management organisation (TMO) was set up by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tower’s owner, to run the property., The inquiry was shown a project meeting note written by Sounes on 24 July 2012 saying “the TMO would like ... the total fee up until stage D a design phase not exceeding £174k which is the OJEU threshold for requiring work to be tendered. This will probably mean deferring some fees.”, Three days later, Sounes proposed to Mark Anderson, the director of assets and regeneration at the TMO, “a 50% deferment of all stage D fees to keep the total stage D fee below £174k”., Sounes said in his statement to the inquiry: “I understood that this limit was the maximum contract value permissible under EU procurement regulations, above which KCTMO would have to follow a compliant procurement process in selecting consultants. Such a process might involve advertising and tendering the opportunity publicly or using consultants from an approved framework list.”, The inquiry had earlier heard that in May 2012 when the consultants were told they were working on the job, Anderson had stressed: “We have a project to deliver within a very tight timescale and an even tighter budget.”, Under cross-examination by Grange, Sounes confirmed that at the time none of the Studio E architects had experience of over-cladding projects., The chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, asked Sounes: “Did you ever suggest to the TMO that because of the level of fees it ought to go out to tender?”, Sounes replied: “I’m afraid I don’t have the insight on the OJEU rules to take a view on what ought to have happened,” adding that he did not know who in the TMO made the decision., By December 2012, Studio E had stopped invoicing because it had reached the OJEU threshold., The inquiry continues., grenfell tower firm set fees to avoid contract going out to tender inquiry", "label": 0}, "train-172": {"text": "\nTommy Robinson faces assault charge after Center Parcs arrest\n, Former EDL leader arrested at Woburn Forest site is due to appear in court in April, PA Media, \n\nTue 3 Mar 2020 09.58 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 3 Mar 2020 15.40 EST\n\n, The former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has been charged with common assault following an incident at Center Parcs in Bedfordshire., Bedfordshire police said the 37-year-old, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was due to appear at Luton magistrates court on 2 April and had been released on bail., He was arrested on Sunday at about 1.10pm after officers were called to Center Parcs in Woburn Forest over an altercation between two men., One man sustained an injury to his face and received first aid at the scene., A Center Parcs spokesman confirmed that police attended the Woburn Forest site on Sunday.tommy robinson faces assault charge after center parcs arrest", "label": 0}, "train-173": {"text": "\nLondon knife attack victim says her life has changed for ever\n, Ayfer Bektas left paralysed after random assault by Jason Kakaire in Edmonton last year, PA Media, \n\nTue 3 Mar 2020 09.14 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Tue 3 Mar 2020 09.00 EST\n\n, A woman undergoing breast cancer treatment has said her life was “changed for ever” after being left paralysed by a man who went on a stabbing rampage in north London last year., Ayfer Bektas, a mother of two from Edmonton, will never be able to walk again after she was attacked by Jason Kakaire as she went for an early evening walk near her home on 30 March 2019., She sustained substantial injuries, including a severed spinal cord, and now struggles to leave the house and cannot sleep. She was stabbed with such ferocity that the knife handle snapped. The blade had to be surgically removed from her back., Bektas was one of five people randomly attacked by Kakaire, 30, between 30 March and 2 April, four of whom were left with life-threatening injuries, a sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey heard., Kakaire, who has been held at Broadmoor hospital, pleaded guilty to five alternative charges of wounding with intent and five charges of having a blade in public the day he was due to go on trial for attempted murder., In a victim impact statement, read by the prosecutor, Rossano Scamardella QC, on Tuesday, Bektas described how she was the first victim of “a vicious assault” as she underwent cancer treatment., She said: “The injury has totally changed my life forever. I suffer with tremendous psychological issues … and I always want someone behind me. I shout out in public … I cannot get these thoughts out of my head. I am too fearful to venture outside unless I absolutely have to. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety., “I wake up so many times at night, if I manage to sleep at all. I do not cope well in crowded places either. My husband has not been able to work any more. My life has in one moment been turned upside down. I have no social life., “I was not in employment at the time, but that’s because I was battling with breast cancer, which was diagnosed five years earlier. I was still getting treatment for this., “Overall, the assault has had a terrible impact on me. I hope one day I will feel strong enough to live with some enjoyment again. I hope justice is served so he is unable to do this again.”, The other victims reported having similar mental and physical injuries. Suleyman Karayapi, who was stabbed as he left his home at 5am on 2 April to buy medication for his son, said he kept reliving the incident in his mind and had to be cared for by his heavily pregnant wife., He said: “My wife only had two weeks to give birth to our child. I feared I wouldn’t see the baby growing up. I’m now suffering from depression. When I used to take my children to the park, I cannot do this. We have two children with disabilities. , “I am now living in fear. When I’m walking outside and someone walks past me, I feel frightened.”, Kakaire, also from Edmonton, told police he heard voices in his head in the days leading up to the attacks, telling him to kill people, the prosecutor said., He will be sentenced at a later date after psychological reports.edmonton stab victim says life was changed forever by attack", "label": 0}, "train-174": {"text": "\nHit-and-run driver jailed after fracturing skull of police officer\n, Chris Burnham was carried on Tekle Lennox’s bonnet for 40 metres before being thrown off, PA Media, \n\nTue 3 Mar 2020 09.11 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 3 Mar 2020 15.40 EST\n\n, A hit-and-run driver who left a police officer with a fractured skull has been jailed for seven years and four months for causing grievous bodily harm with intent to resist arrest., Tekle Lennox, 37, of no fixed address, was filmed on another motorist’s dashcam driving his Mini when it struck PC Chris Burnham, knocking him on to the windscreen and carrying him on the bonnet for almost three seconds before throwing him into the road., Lennox, who has convictions for driving and drugs offences, showed no emotion in the dock as he watched footage of his victim lying injured near a roundabout in Coventry after being carried along by the Mini for 42 metres (138ft)., Warwick crown court heard on Tuesday that Burnham, 48, sustained multiple injuries, including a shattered knee and a bleed on the brain associated with a head injury., The constable was trying to apprehend Lennox, who was serving a three-year road ban for drug-driving and driving while disqualified, after he failed to pull over in the Holbrooks area of Coventry on 25 September last year., Judge Peter Cooke heard that Lennox had less than a second to react after Burnham walked out from behind a van, but then failed to brake, and later increased his speed from around 18mph to 24mph., Passing sentence, Cooke also handed the pub worker a five-year driving ban, to be served after his release from prison., The judge said he accepted that no driver would have had enough time to avoid the collision but that Lennox had put in train a set of events that had changed PC Burnham’s life, possibly for ever., The judge told Lennox: “The impacts on PC Burnham have been profound and, sad to say, the degree of permanence of those consequences remain uncertain even today., “He and his family have been through hell over the past few months. These events came about because you would not be stopped by the police when you were at the wheel of that Mini.”, Describing the collision, the judge told Lennox: “You hit Mr Burnham ... he was thrown up in the most horrific fashion on to the bonnet of the vehicle., “He was then carried 42 metres along the road from the point of impact before he fell from the car.

The initial environmental statement for the high-speed rail network was made in 2013, before the government signed the Paris agreement and committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050., Packham said: “Every important policy decision should now have the future of our environment at the forefront of its considerations. But in regard to the HS2 rail project I believe our government has failed. I believe that essential submissions regarding environmental concerns were ignored by the review panel., “As a consequence, the Oakervee review is compromised, incomplete and flawed and thus the decision to proceed based upon it is unlawful.”, Tom Short, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day, said the “environmental impacts relevant to the decision whether to proceed have not been properly assessed”., He added: “In a time of unprecedented ecological catastrophe, Packham is clear that the law, and moral logic, require the government to think again.”, The Department for Transport said it was considering the claim and would respond in due course., A DfT spokesperson added: “We understand campaigners’ concerns, and have tasked HS2 Ltd to deliver one of the UK’s most environmentally responsible infrastructure projects. When finished, HS2 will play a key part in our efforts to tackle climate change, reducing carbon emissions by providing an alternative to domestic flights and cutting congestion on our roads.”, HS2 Ltd will build a new high-speed rail line linking London with Birmingham, and later Manchester and Leeds. The Oakervee review, commissioned by Johnson after becoming prime minister, said the costs of the project could rise to more than £106bn., Campaigners say the line will damage or destroy almost 700 wildlife sites, including more than 100 ancient woodlands. HS2 disputes the figure and says only 62 ancient woodlands will be affected, and most of those would remain intact.hs2 legal challenge launched by chris packham", "label": 0}, "train-176": {"text": "\nTwo men arrested in connection with attack on prison officer\n, Pair held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and preparation of a terrorist act, \nJedidajah Otte, \n\nMon 2 Mar 2020 19.48 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 2 Mar 2020 20.39 EST\n\n, Two men have been arrested in connection with an attack on a prison officer at HMP Whitemoor on 9 January, the Metropolitan police have said.The men, aged 24 and 26, were arrested on Monday night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and preparation of a terrorist act under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006., Both men were detained using powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

Councils are facing large bills to repair the damage and on Monday it was reported that the UK had experienced its wettest February on record., Wilson referred to the infamous BBC lunchtime report on 15 October 1987 where weatherman Michael Fish “cheerfully dismissed” a viewer’s concerns that “a hurricane was on the way”., Later that evening, what is now known as the Great Storm of 1987 happened.

It’s a tricky balance.”, Wilson also said there was a “moral obligation” on TV forecasters to tell viewers that the more extreme climate events they are reporting on are caused by global heating., “We need to tell people to stop warming the atmosphere, to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere,” he said. “That way, viewers won’t lose sight of the fact that they can actually do something about it., The BBC used the Met Office as its main source for forecasts for 94 years until 2017 when it switched to MeteoGroup.

Under the law, she had to show she had a lawful reason to have it in her possession., A jury cleared Williams of corruptly failing to report the video to her superiors but convicted her of possession of it., Some saw these two verdicts as contradictory and questioned why the Met had pursued her when it had the option not to do so., It is expected that if the court of appeal decides to hear William’s attempt to overturn her conviction, the Met would consider postponing the hearing at which she faces being sacked.met officer faces sack over child abuse video despite appeal", "label": 0}, "train-181": {"text": "\nHundreds turn out for funeral of footballer Jordan Sinnott\n, Former Huddersfield Town player, who was 25, died after being assaulted on a night out, \nGregory Robinson, \n\nWed 4 Mar 2020 12.23 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 4 Mar 2020 12.48 EST\n\n, Hundreds of people turned out for the funeral of a footballer who died after being assaulted while on a night out., The funeral for Jordan Sinnott took place at Bradford City’s Valley Parade ground on Wednesday.

I am absolutely blown away with this price and it gives me opportunities to do things that I never thought we could.”, The medal was sold with related items, including a letter from Downing Street informing Russell of the award, a telegram from the princess royal and a letter from the Metropolitan police commissioner., Russell, who boxed at the Repton Club in Bethnal Green, east London, was an area manager for an office cleaning firm in the capital at the time of the kidnap attempt., He had been working in Princess Square on Pall Mall on the evening of 20 March 1974 and was returning home to Strood, Kent, at about 8pm., Ball had blocked the princess’s car with his own as it drove along the Mall towards Buckingham Palace, and fired a series of shots through the rear window., Russell, who is 6ft 2in and weighed 17 stone, at first thought it was a road-rage incident but rushed to Anne’s assistance when he realised what was happening., He later recalled how the princess told Ball: “Just go away and don’t be such a silly man,” as he tried to drag her from the car., “I hit him as hard as I could – if he had been a tree he would have fallen over – and he was flat on the floor face down,” Russell said., Anne and her then husband, Capt Mark Phillips, were unhurt during the ambush, but the princess’s personal detective, chauffeur, a police constable and a journalist were all shot by Ball, who was armed with two revolvers., Ball was later sent to a psychiatric hospital by an Old Bailey judge., Auctioneer Oliver Pepys, the associate director of Dix Noonan Webb, said the price fetched by the medal reflected Russell’s remarkable story., “Ronnie Russell displayed an outstanding act of gallantry, and it is fitting that his George Medal achieved such a fantastic price at today’s auction – a price that not only reflects the wonderful story of courage behind the medal, but also shows how strong the market for medals currently is,” he said.princess anne kidnap medal fetches 50000 at auction", "label": 0}, "train-184": {"text": "\nGrenfell engineers set out to 'massage' fire safety plan, inquiry told\n, Contractor privately admitted refurbishment works would make ‘a crap condition worse’, \nRobert Booth Social affairs correspondent, \n\nWed 4 Mar 2020 09.21 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 4 Mar 2020 15.00 EST\n\n, Engineers working on Grenfell Tower set out to “massage” the fire safety strategy to get it past official checks, and privately admitted plans to refurbish the building were making “a crap condition worse”, the inquiry into the disaster that killed 72 people has heard., A senior fire engineer working on the refurbishment for consultant Exova Warrington Fire said in an internal email that the proposal to add additional flats around a single staircase in the 1970s block was “not great”., The email revealed that after having spoken to the architect, Bruce Sounes, about the plans in August 2012, Cate Cooney, a senior consultant at Exova, told a colleague: “Basically I have told him we can massage the proposal to something acceptable, with separation, lobbies etc, but that there are approval risks in the project on the ff shaft/MOE front.” FF normally means firefighting shaft, while MOE is used to abbreviate means of escape., The email was sent four years before the refurbishment works were signed off by the building control department at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which also owned the 120-home block. The inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, has already ruled that the building was refurbished in breach of safety regulations. Several of the people who died perished on the single staircase that served the building and became smoke-logged.

The Endeavour Fund was set up by the Royal Foundation to finance inspiring sporting and adventure projects to help veterans’ recovery., The ceremony, at London’s Mansion House, is the first time the couple have been seen since they visited Canada House on 7 January to thank the nation for hosting them., The couple arrived sheltering under an umbrella, to mainly cheers from a small crowd of wellwishers braving the inclement weather, though there was one loud boo., For her return Meghan, who has not been seen publicly in the UK since the couple’s announcement, wore a turquoise fitted dress designed by Victoria Beckham, as she and Harry arrived in a Range Rover., Although Harry has relinquished his honorary military titles as the couple step back from their royal roles and will no longer officially represent the Queen, he intends to retain his links with patronages such as the Endeavour Fund, and the Invictus Games which he founded. In his award ceremony speech, he said he was “deeply proud to have served alongside you as Captain Wales”., “A lot of you tonight have told me you have my back, well I’m also here to tell you I’ve always got yours,” he said., He and Meghan were “so happy to be back” presenting the awards, he said., “For some, the military community represents a brotherhood or sisterhood that no other organisation can provide, and for others it’s a way of life which you never want to leave. For a lot of us, it’s both,” he said, praising the award winners., “Being able to serve Queen and country is something we all are rightly proud of, and it never leaves us. Once served, always serving!” he added., As they left, there were cries of “Come of ‘Arry” from the small crowd outside. Earlier, the couple had been spotted outside Buckingham Palace, though aides declined to comment on whether the Queen, who was carrying out audiences at her London residence, had met them., They were also photographed outside the Goring Hotel after a private lunch, a royal favourite for many years which has been granted the prestigious Royal Warrant., The couple’s spokeswoman said: “In addition to the official engagements the duke and duchess are conducting over the course of the next few days, they are also meeting privately with several of their patronages.”, Harry, who had sacrificed his official patronages after their announcement, will retain private links to organisations of which he is a patron., He travelled to the UK alone last week, attending an eco-tourism summit in Scotland, and then the famous Abbey Road recording studios in London.

The Foreign Office refused to hand over its files on the case to the court., The Guardian and other news organisations can reveal the ruling following months of private hearings and a legal dispute that reached the supreme court. It details an extraordinary family saga spanning 20 years during which the sheikh, 70, organised international kidnappings, imprisoned both Shamsa and another daughter, Latifa, and “deprived them of their liberty”., Princess Latifa, then 32, was seized by Indian army commandos from the Indian Ocean in 2018 after fleeing her home, and was forcibly returned to Dubai., Allegations of torture surfaced during the case. Latifa said she was exposed at one stage to “constant torture”, and the judge, while he did not make any finding on that specific point, said he felt confident in relying upon her account. She claimed to have been kept in solitude in the dark and beaten repeatedly., The sheikh’s actions emerged after his sixth and youngest wife, Princess Haya, 45, fled to London last April with their two young children. His attempt to return the children to Dubai triggered a legal action in the family courts., Haya resisted it with a counter-claim seeking a forced marriage protection order in respect of their daughter, alleging that the sheikh was trying to marry her off to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. ‘MBS’, as he is better known, has been accused of involvement in the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The court did not find this allegation to be true., The judgment raises questions about whether the Foreign Office blocked the police investigation into the disappearance of Shamsa, after she had fled to Cambridge from Surrey in 2000. McFarlane said he was unable to make a determination because the Foreign Office refused to cooperate on freedom of information grounds., Following the ruling, Labour’s shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, said: “This is clearly a shocking judgment. Both Priti Patel the home secretary and Dominic Raab the foreign secretary must urgently investigate why a criminal inquiry into a kidnap in Cambridge appears to have been impeded.”, David Haigh, the British lawyer for Princess Latifa, told the Guardian that he was sending the judgment to the United Nations’ working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances, which is already investigating Latifa’s disappearance., “We are delighted with the judgment,” he said. “It’s vindication for everything we have been saying, vindication for Shamsa, Latifa and Haya.”, Haigh said that he and Tiina Jauhiainen, Latifa’s close friend, had been interviewed at the end of last year by Cambridge police, who are still investigating Shamsa’s abduction. He added: “It is now clear to see why Sheikh Mohammed did not want these judgments to be made available to the world. They show him as someone unfit to be in charge of children, let alone a state that is an ally of the UK.”, Sheikh Mohammed’s behaviour was first highlighted by a Guardian article in 2001, the judgment noted, adding that Haya read the story about Shamsa’s disappearance in 2016 but initially did not believe her husband was implicated., Sheikh Mohammed is also the vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates. He has fathered 25 children; his two with Haya are the youngest., He refused to attend any of the multiple hearings at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London. His wife, Haya, was a constant presence in court, sitting alongside her solicitor, the prominent divorce lawyer Lady Shackleton., The judgment goes into detail about the campaign of harassment endured by Haya. The judge accepted virtually all her allegations as true on the balance of probabilities, including that the sheikh:, Attempted to have her abducted by helicopter., Arranged for guns to be left in her bedroom., Taunted her over her adulterous relationship with a bodyguard., Divorced her without telling her., Threatened to seize their children., Published threatening poems about her online., McFarlane finds that their relationship had deteriorated and that sometime in 2017 or 2018 she “embarked upon an adulterous relationship with one of her male bodyguards”., In early 2019, Haya began to show interest in the fate of her husband’s daughters, Shamsa and Latifa. According to the judgment, the sheikh began to make threats against her and in February, divorced her under sharia law without informing her.On 11 March that year, the judgment records, a helicopter landed near her compound in Dubai and the pilot told her he was going to take her to Awir, “a prison in the desert”., Haya said that if her son had not been there and clung on to her leg, she would have been taken away. The judgment added: “Flight documents with respect to the helicopter have been disclosed and show that one of the crew was one of the three people named by Shamsa and an employee of the sheikh as being involved in Shamsa’s removal from England in 2000.”, It continues: “Throughout this period the mother received a series of anonymous notes, left in her bedroom or elsewhere, making threats, for example ‘We will take your son – your daughter is ours – your life is over’ or warning her to be careful ... On two occasions in March 2019, the mother states that she found a gun left on her bed with the muzzle pointing towards the door and the safety catch off.”, In June, the sheikh published a poem entitled You Lived and Died. Haya saw it as a direct threat to her and a public announcement of her “betrayal”., The poem stated: “You traitor, you betrayed the most precious trust. I exposed you and your games … I have the evidence that convicts you of what you have done … You know your actions are an insult … Let’s see if mischief brings you benefits, I care not whether you live or die.”, McFarlane’s judgment explains that his ruling “may well involve findings, albeit on the civil standard, of behaviour which is contrary to the criminal law of England and Wales, international law, international maritime law, and internationally accepted human rights norms”., The civil standard is a conclusion made on the balance of probabilities; that is, the allegation is more likely than not to be true. It is not a finding to the criminal standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt., McFarlane ends his judgment saying: “These findings, taken together, demonstrate a consistent course of conduct over two decades where, if he deems it necessary to do so, the father Sheikh Mohammed will use the very substantial powers at his disposal to achieve his particular aims.”, The sheikh has denied all the allegations against him. In a statement issued to the media, he said: “This case concerns highly personal and private matters relating to our children. The appeal was made to protect the best interests and welfare of the children. The outcome does not protect my children from media attention in the way that other children in family proceedings in the UK are protected., “As a head of government, I was not able to participate in the court’s fact-finding process. This has resulted in the release of a ‘fact-finding’ judgment which inevitably tells only one side of the story. I ask that the media respect the privacy of our children and do not intrude into their lives in the UK.”, Neither the Foreign Office, Crown Prosecution Service nor Cambridgeshire police commented.calls for sheikh to face justice over family abduction", "label": 0}, "train-189": {"text": "\nInformation about teenager's murder 'not followed up', say family\n, Family of 16-year-old Shanur Ahmed, killed in east London, have concerns over how police dealt with the case, \nSarah Marsh and \nVikram Dodd, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 14.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 17.38 EST\n\n, The family of a 16-year-old boy murdered in east London on Tuesday have expressed concern about how the police dealt with the case, and have claimed that information passed on was not followed up properly., The death of Shanur Ahmed is the 18th homicide recorded so far this year in London. The teenager was found with head injuries on scrubland near Gallions Reach DLR station just after 8.30am on Tuesday., Detectives are trying to find a motive for the killing, and among the lines of inquiry they are are examining is whether the brutal attack was gang-related. Police were called on Monday evening to a report of a group of youths, some armed with baseball bats, fighting near Gallions Reach., On Thursday, eight bunches of flowers and some daffodils tied together with elastic bands were laid on grass beside the station, near where Ahmed’s body was discovered., Asad Ahmed, the teenager’s uncle, said: “When Shanur was reported missing on Monday evening, after that we had some information via his friend on Snapchat to say his life was in danger. This message was forwarded onto officers who came to take the initial report but it was not followed up appropriately.”, A Metropolitan police spokesperson said the force’s directorate of professional standards was looking into the issue of the call from the family. They added the matter had also been passed to the Independent Office of Police Conduct “as a matter of course”., Information about Shanur that had been circulating on social media has since been removed., Asad Ahmed said that the officers handling the case may have been inexperienced, and said the family had not yet made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan police, although it had been mentioned informally., “It was just that level of expertise lacking at that time and it needs to be flagged. We have flagged it with the local police – whether it’s a training issue within the police or something else, it needs to be looked into. The pressure needs to be there from the family and the public, because there cannot be another life lost through an incident like this,” he said., The uncle said that the family, who live in Manor Park, tried to locate Shanur themselves. They drove past Gallions Reach station three times – where a witness had seen the youths with baseball bats – but they did not realise the teenager lay yards away in the scrubland., Ahmed said that his nephew’s glasses were also found by the family on the site where his body was discovered. “To find they were still at the scene was a distressing moment for the family,” he said., Police are trying to establish what the relationship was between the victim and the group of around 30 males seen fighting. Another line of inquiry is whether he was involved in that group, or somehow became caught up in it. Detectives are cautious about automatically assuming that the reports of a group of 30 males in the area the day before definitely link them to the death., “We haven’t been given further information as of yet,” Ahmed said. “We are hoping for more information so his parents will be able to see their child. They have not been able to see his body yet.”, The uncle described his nephew as a “very caring child” who wanted to help others all the time. “He was very popular among his friends in college and school. He was the child that every mother and father would like – very helpful, an ideal child.” He added that he did not think his nephew was involved in any gangs but was in “the wrong place at the wrong time”., Before he was killed, the 16-year-old had visited a friend in hospital who had been involved in a fight. “There was a fight outside college, that is what we have heard,” Ahmed said. “I am not sure what it was relating to … We don’t know the detail of it at this stage but believe there are hundreds of hours of CCTV footage going through.”, Shanur vanished at 6pm after the hospital visit. “He was ambitious, studying his A-levels. He wanted to go to university and to help his dad with his business, learn how to drive,” Asad Ahmed said., “He has got a younger brother who is 10 years old and yesterday was very stressful. He came over and asked – can they resuscitate him Shanur and bring him back? How do you explain to a child that the brother they love and was always with is no more?”, On Wednesday, DCI Larry Smith said: “A young teenage boy has died and his family and friends are devastated.

Living in Cornwall, I feel that we are always forgotten by governments who think of us as too far away to think about, unless they want to retire here, or have a holiday or own a holiday cottage., The EU gave us a lot of support over the years as we were considered one of the poorest areas in the UK. It is very concerning that we have left the comfort of funding from the EU for our farming, fishing and industry. The funding from the EU was of great benefit to us. Without it we would never have had the airport at Newquay or the various tourist attractions like the Eden Project and the university in Cornwall., Please may we have more about Cornwall in your paper?

As he arrives he can park for free in our town car park, opposite the town library, doctor’s surgery and fire station.

But she is wrong to dismiss the bullying allegations as “trifling” in comparison., In truth, both are part of the same problem – a bullying culture, where it is difficult and career-limiting to speak out or disagree, is a culture that creates scandals such as Windrush. A department that doesn’t care about its staff won’t care about those it affects either. Gentleman complains that officials took “no discernible action”, but civil servants suffer from the fact that their actions are often not discernible to the outside world – I don’t know if officials within the Home Office did challenge their leaders in response to the Guardian’s Windrush evidence, but I do know that I want them to be working in an environment where they could do so without fear of suffering attacks or reprisals.Clare SheffieldWest Bridgford, Nottinghamshire , • Amelia Gentleman’s article is everything we might expect from this fine journalist, and Windrush remains a huge blot on the Home Office record. But the current bullying allegations go far beyond the individual, in this case Sir Philip Rutnam, and beyond his department., The outcome of this kerfuffle will hopefully help to put the brakes on a culture of bullying apparently typified by Dominic Cummings, which seems to infect the entire government, and which is leading to an exodus or stifling of talent at a time when it is needed as at no other in living memory. So, in this instance, at least, we must surely wish all power to Sir Philip’s elbow.Ian BartlettEast Molesey, Surrey, • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com, • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters, • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

The officer, who works in “frontline policing”, has been taken to a south London police station where he remains in custody., The arrest relates to suspected membership of a proscribed organisation linked to rightwing terrorism, but the Met said there is nothing to suggest there is any threat to the wider public., Scotland Yard said the force’s directorate of professional standards has been told and the officer’s status is under review. Recruits are supposedly vetted before starting as police constables and senior officers felt they had measures in place to stop infiltration by extremist groups., Last year the Guardian revealed that a suspected far-right sympathiser was feared to be at large in the Met, after managing to scrawl, undetected, a swastika in a secure area of a police station. The culprit has not been caught and the discovery shocked ethnic minority and other staff., The swastika was found in February 2019 drawn on an inside wall at Edmonton police station in Enfield, north London, in an area only accessible to officers and staff., Counter-terror chiefs have described the far right as the fastest-growing terror threat. The British military has put in extra measures amid concerns about attempts at far-right infiltration and concern about some forces’ apparent support for extremist figures such as Tommy Robinson., The case has been referred to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog., The arrest comes after MPs backed a ban on membership of more rightwing groups last month. A proscription order was issued which makes joining Sonnenkrieg Division illegal in the UK. The law also recognises System Resistance Network as an alias of the already banned neo-Nazi group National Action., Anyone found to be a member of, or offering support to, the banned groups can face up to 10 years in jail.met police officer arrested suspected of belonging to group linked to terrorism", "label": 0}, "train-193": {"text": "\nJolyon Maugham will not be prosecuted for clubbing fox to death\n, Lawyer had tweeted about killing animal while wearing wife’s kimono on Boxing Day, \nAamna Mohdin, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 09.50 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 19.30 EST\n\n, The lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC will not be prosecuted for clubbing a fox to death on Boxing Day morning while wearing his wife’s satin kimono., The prominent remain supporter tweeted on 26 December that he had killed a fox with a baseball bat while wearing the gown after it became trapped while trying to get inside a hen house in his back garden in central London., The incident was widely condemned on Twitter and was brought to the attention of the RSPCA, which urged anyone with first-hand knowledge of the incident to report it., The charity announced on Thursday that after conducting an investigation, which involved independent experts, a veterinary pathologist and a forensic vet, Maugham would not be prosecuted. Its prosecutions department concluded the evidential threshold needed to bring a prosecution was not met as the findings suggested the fox was killed swiftly., The RSPCA said: “When making prosecution decisions, we must be fair and objective and make them on the facts of each case., “It is important to understand that it is not necessarily illegal to kill a fox, but if unnecessary suffering is caused, a criminal offence may have been committed.”, Maugham welcomed the decision, saying in a statement: “I know that some were genuinely upset by my actions on Boxing Day and the tone of my tweets. I am profoundly sorry for that upset. It was my intention to convey in a gently deprecating manner the incongruity of my Boxing Day morning. I got that wrong.”, The RSPCA said it did not condone the killing of healthy foxes. It added that the correct way to protect livestock was with good fencing and deterrents. When a fox is tangled in fencing, individuals should aim to humanely free the animal wherever possible, the charity added. Maugham said: “As to my actions, in the situation I found myself – needing to act in great haste to save the chickens my family keeps – I did not have the luxury of time to reflect on the competing ethical approaches of the RSPCA and Natural England. Of course, I respect the different assessments others might, equally reasonably, have made.”jolyon maugham will not prosecuted clubbing fox death kimono", "label": 0}, "train-194": {"text": "\nUK freed 42 terrorists in year before law to detain extremists for longer\n, Latest figures also reveal rise in far-right detainees in UK prisons, \nJamie Grierson Home affairs correspondent, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 09.23 EST\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 5 Mar 2020 09.18 EST\n\n, More than 40 convicted terrorists were released from prison in the year before emergency legislation was introduced to keep jailed extremists locked up for longer, figures reveal, while the number of far-right detainees has surged., After a non-fatal terror attack in south-west London last month, the government fast-tracked laws to prevent the automatic release of terrorist offenders without Parole Board assessment. The new laws, which came into force a week ago, were applied retrospectively, meaning serving prisoners will stay in prison longer than expected., But according to the latest figures on use of the Terrorism Act, in the year to September 2019, 42 convicted terrorists were released from custody after serving prison sentences, some of whom would have been released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence with no Parole Board assessment., Meanwhile, the figures reveal that the number of prisoners classed as rightwing extremists who are behind bars for terrorism offences has almost doubled in two years., In the year to the end of December, there were 41 people in custody categorised as holding extreme rightwing ideology, up from just a handful of cases five years ago –four in 2014 – to 21 for the same period in 2017 and 28 in 2018., Last month, a proscription order was issued, making membership of the neo-nazi group Sonnenkrieg Division illegal in the UK. It also recognised System Resistance Network as an alias of the already banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Anyone found to be a member of, or offering support to, the groups could now face up to 10 years in jail., Overall, as of 31 December, there were 231 people in custody for terrorism-related offences, the “vast majority”, or 77%, branded as holding Islamist-extremist views., The convicted terrorist Sudesh Amman, who was shot dead by plain-clothes officers after he stabbed two people on 2 February, was released about 10 days before he launched the assault on a busy Streatham High Road. He had been released automatically at the midway point of his sentence despite authorities having serious concerns about the risk he posed to the public., Under the emergency laws, all terrorist offenders will now have to serve two thirds of their sentence before being eligible for a Parole Board assessment and will not be automatically released., The proposals were in addition to a broad package of counter-terrorism measures announced by the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice, which included plans to introduce lie-detector tests for terrorist offenders as well as the recruitment of specialist counter-terrorism probation officers., The number of arrests for terrorism-related activity has dropped to the lowest number in six years – 280 to 31 December – but rose in the last quarter and remains higher than the annual average of 260., Of these, 110 (39%) people were released on bail or released under investigation – meaning they were not subjected to any restrictions while inquiries into the offences continued. There were 87 (31%) charged and 65 of these were for terrorism-related offences. A further 19 (7%) received a caution, were recalled to prison or handed over to immigration authorities and 63 suspects or 23% were released without charge., Commonly, sentences are consistently less than four years and were handed down for more than half of the convictions, 24 out of 46. Three offenders in the last year were handed a life sentence, down from six in the previous year, but the number of long-term sentences of more than 10 years rose slightly.uk freed 42 terrorists in year before law to detain extremists for longer", "label": 0}, "train-195": {"text": "\nExtradition case against Catalan MEP suspended in Scotland\n, Lawyer for Clara Ponsatí says case is in ‘stalemate’ until issue of immunity in Spain is settled, \nSeverin Carrell Scotland editor, \n\nThu 5 Mar 2020 08.46 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 5 Mar 2020 13.40 EST\n\n, A court has suspended the extradition case against Clara Ponsatí, a Catalan economist living in Scotland, because she has immunity from prosecution after becoming an MEP., The Spanish courts issued extradition proceedings against Ponsatí, a professor at St Andrew’s University, for alleged sedition because she was an education minister when Catalonia’s government held an unlawful independence referendum in 2017., Ponsatí’s lawyers told Edinburgh sheriff court on Thursday that Ponsatí had immunity from prosecution because she was now an MEP, winning a seat in the European parliament after Spain was given extra parliamentary seats when the UK left the EU on 31 January., The sheriff, Nigel Ross, agreed to suspend the case against her until the European parliament ruled on an application from Spain to suspend her immunity and that of two other Catalan nationalists who also became MEPs after Brexit, Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan president at the time of the referendum, and Toni Comín., Puigdemont and Comín are living in self-imposed exile in Belgium because they also face arrest if they return to Spain., The hearing on Thursday was originally arranged before Ponsatí became an MEP to hear legal arguments on the competency of Spain’s extradition warrant and on dual criminality – whether the Spanish offences were also illegal under UK law., John Scott QC, a solicitor advocate appearing for the crown, said Spain had applied for Ponsatí’s immunity to be waived in February and that it would take about four months for a decision to be made., The full extradition hearing had been timetabled for May but Ross said the hearing would be suspended until 18 June to see what happened with the immunity question in the European parliament., Gordon Jackson QC, Ponsatí’s lawyer, told the court the Spanish government had accepted she had immunity from prosecution in Spain because she was an MEP, but had refused to withdraw or suspend the extradition warrant., “We’ve agreed that it would make absolutely no sense whatsoever to keep going with this until that immunity issue is sorted,” Jackson told the court. “We seem to be in a kind of stalemate until that gets sorted.”, Ponsatí, whose teaching duties at St Andrews have been cut back heavily since she became an MEP, could face a 15-year jail sentence if found guilty of sedition. Nine other Catalan officials were given jail sentences of between nine and 13 years for the same offence in autumn last year.clara ponsati extradition case against catalan mep suspended in scotland", "label": 0}, "train-196": {"text": "\nBudget 2020: chancellor plans to finally end tampon tax\n, The 5% rate on sanitary products will end. Rishi Sunak also plans to ensure banks keep circulating cash, \nPatrick Collinson, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 17.30 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Mon 9 Mar 2020 13.58 EDT\n\n, The chancellor will announce the abolition of the “tampon tax” in next week’s budget, marking the successful conclusion to a 20-year campaign by women’s rights activists., Tampons and other women’s sanitary products currently have 5% VAT added to their price, but this will be scrapped, saving the average woman £40 over her lifetime. The tax will be dropped when the transition period for Britain leaving the EU ends on 31 December., In a separate move, Rishi Sunak is also expected to announce in the budget measures to protect access to cash. The chancellor is expected to introduce new laws that will ensure banks continue to circulate cash around the country and that it remains available to those who want to use it., The independent Access to Cash Review last year warned that Britain’s cash system was on the verge of collapse. Natalie Ceeney, who chaired the report, said: “A guaranteed future for cash will be extremely welcome. We need the proposed legislation to be introduced quickly, so that we can maintain a viable cash system in the UK while so many people need it.”, The scrapping of the tampon tax is a victory for the two-decade long campaign by women’s groups against VAT rules that once categorised tampons as “non-essential, luxury items”., Twenty years ago, Labour MP Dawn Primarolo successfully led a campaign to cut the VAT on tampons from 17.5% to 5%, but governments since then have said that EU rules have prohibited dropping the rate any further., Sunak is expected to announce that the tax will finally be abolished when the transition period for leaving the EU ends in December 2020., It is thought the tax cut will be worth 7p off a pack of 20 tampons and 5p off a pack of 12 pads., Campaigners said they were jubilant. Laura Coryton started the Stop Taxing Periods campaign in May 2014 while a student at Goldsmiths, with her petition gaining more than 320,000 signatures., She said: “The end of this tax symbolises the end of a symptom of sexism and the period taboo, which has created period poverty and has stopped girls from going to school. I’m so happy that all 320,000 people who signed my petition, as well as the many generations who have campaigned against this tax, have finally been listened to.”, The government has long insisted that the EU VAT Directive has prevented it from applying a rate of tax lower than 5%, although in 2016 the then prime minister David Cameron said he had persuaded European ministers to agree to change the rules to allow zero-rating of sanitary products, but that the implementation would take several years., Paula Sherriff, who as a Labour MP campaigned against the tampon tax, said: “I am pleased that the tampon tax is finally being scrapped. Contrary to government claims, permission was granted to 0% rate menstrual products in 2016, following acceptance of my budget amendment. This was achieved through tireless campaigning by so many including the indefatigable Laura Coryton.”, Elsewhere in the EU, there have been widespread campaigns to lower the tax, with Germany recently reducing its tampon tax to 7% from 19%., In 2015, then chancellor George Osborne pledged that he would channel tax raised from VAT on tampons directly to charities that help women. Since then, £47m has been passed to the charities, although this will come to an end when the new zero rate of VAT on sanitary products is introduced., The decision to pass the tax money to women’s charities was not without controversy. It emerged in 2017 that £250,000 of the money was handed to Life, a charity that campaigns against abortion., • This article was amended on 9 March 2020 to clarify that the tax will be dropped on 31 December, which will be the end of the Brexit transition period, not when Britain leaves the EU as originally stated, because this happened at the end of January.budget 2020 chancellor plans to finally end tampon tax", "label": 0}, "train-197": {"text": "\nWeatherwatch: how a March blizzard took England by surprise\n, Politicians in 1970 hoped better computers would improve forecasting – and they have, \nDavid Hambling, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 16.30 EST\n\n, Half a century ago, on 4 March 1970, an unexpected blizzard dumped more than 25cm of snow across central and south-east England overnight. Temperatures hovered around freezing and the snow settled, closing roads and airports. Morning trains from the Midlands arrived in London eight hours late., The problem was the lack of warning. The Met Office did not start issuing snow alerts until the early hours, and most people were caught unprepared. While winter storms can be forecast, determining whether they will bring rain or snow requires precise modelling. A slight change in temperature can have a big impact on what form the precipitation takes., Questions were asked in parliament about the snowfall. John Ellis, for the governing Labour party, was optimistic that the Met Office’s powerful new IBM computer might help predict such events in future., The Conservative MP Nigel Birch was dismissive: “He Ellis said that he wanted to know when the weather was about to be out of the ordinary. My experience of British weather is that it is always out of the ordinary, and it will take more than a dozen computers to alter that.”, However, as the last 50 years have shown, better computers do improve weather forecasting, and we are now less likely to be surprised by unseasonal blizzards.weatherwatch march blizzard england surprise 1970", "label": 0}, "train-198": {"text": "\nSunak to unveil budget aimed at helping firms deal with coronavirus\n, Chancellor mulling measures including tax holidays and support when staff self-isolate, \nHeather Stewart, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 13.25 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 06.57 EDT\n\n, Rishi Sunak is poised to announce a package of emergency measures to support businesses hit by the knock-on effects of the coronavirus crisis in his first budget on Wednesday., The chancellor is considering short-term tax holidays for affected businesses, and taxpayer support for small businesses whose employees self-isolate as the outbreak escalates, the Guardian understands., Tax holidays – covering VAT, national insurance and other levies – were used during the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001 to help farms and other businesses facing a short-term cash crunch. The cost was subsequently estimated at £242m., The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine., The UN agency advises people to:, Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns.

Whitehall insiders said Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was particularly concerned about the issue., Johnson told MPs on Wednesday: “We will take every step we can to make sure that… no one whether employed or self-employed – whatever the status of their employment – is penalised for doing the right thing.”, Josh Hardie, the deputy director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: “People should be supported to follow public health guidance without fear of not being paid. The CBI is calling for the extension of statutory sick pay rights to the low-paid and contracted workers such as agency staff and those on variable or zero-hour contracts. Where the burden of cost starts to become too great, especially for smaller firms, it should be shared fairly between business and the government.”, The incoming Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, made clear at a Treasury select committee hearing this week that small businesses in particular were likely to need financial backup. “We are collectively now going to have to provide some form of supply chain finance in the not too distant future,” he said., After discussions with the Bank, Sunak is also expected to seek to reassure financial markets by outlining more drastic steps the government stands ready to take, if the virus exacerbates the slowdown in GDP growth., The National Institute for Economic and Social Research has predicted the outbreak could knock 0.5% off economic growth this year., The budget is also expected to open the way to greener taxes – beginning with the abolition of the VAT exemption for the red diesel used in tractors and construction vehicles., “We want to move to a place where we tax things we don’t like, and support things we do like,” said a Whitehall source. That could also include ending the decade-long freeze on fuel duty – a measure long favoured by Johnson, but likely to provoke a furious backlash from Tory MPs.sunak to unveil budget aimed at helping firms deal with coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-199": {"text": "\nIt’s not bothy fairies that are hard at work\n, Letters, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 11.33 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 6 Mar 2020 11.50 EST\n\n, It is remiss of you not to have mentioned the Mountain Bothies Association in your article by Geoff Allan (High and Dry, Travel, 29 February)., The MBA is a Scottish charity with a simple mission: to maintain simple shelters in remote country for the use and benefit of all who love wild and lonely places.

The Queen, as head of the 54-nation alliance, will be seated in the front row alongside the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge., But behind, a little apart from this nucleus of the royal family, will be the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, in their final official UK public engagement as senior working royals before “Megxit”., The prime minister, senior politicians, and ambassadors from around the globe will be in the congregation to bear witness to Harry and Meghan’s last hurrah before they depart these shores for an uncertain future., The service draws to a close the couple’s brief farewell tour, which began when Meghan flew in from Canada, where they are currently based, to join Harry at the Endeavour Fund awards for wounded and sick military veterans at London’s Mansion House on Thursday., If, during their flurry of engagements, there has been time for moments of reflection, or even a little sadness, at what they are leaving behind, there was no trepidation evident in their dazzling smiles to the camera., According to a source close to them, the couple are on “great form”. Both are feeling “positive and excited” at what the future holds, even though events have been somewhat overwhelming since they made their shock announcement in January to step back as working royals and base themselves mainly in north America., They remain “1,000% committed” to their patronages, it is said. In the past couple of days they have had private meetings with organisations they are involved with, and with their staff. After 31 March, this team of 15 – currently based at Buckingham Palace – will either be made redundant or redeployed., Meghan, who is said to be “very happy to be back”, has attended several private meetings. On Thursday, she paid a low-key visit to a hologram exhibit at the National Theatre, as well as a comprehensive school in Dagenham, east London on Friday. On Sunday she will mark International Women’s Day., Meanwhile, Harry joined the Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton to open a museum at the Silverstone circuit, and met staff at his Invictus charity, to which he remains committed., On Saturday the couple will attend the Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall. It will be Harry’s final engagement as Captain General of the Royal Marines, the highest rank of his honorary military titles, which he must now relinquish under terms agreed with the Queen., Agreeing to sever his official military ties will have been painful for Harry, who spent 10 years in the army, and who on Thursday, told veterans he was “deeply proud to have served alongside you as Capt Wales”., No replacements will appointed to these roles in the 12 months before the couple’s new status is reviewed. “Nothing is final,” said the source. “It was intentionally not binary … Because this is the great unknown. And, the family wants the best for them.”, This was the message the Queen conveyed to her grandson over a private lunch at Windsor Castle last Sunday. The lunch, at Harry’s request, was their first meeting since the Sandringham summit in January, where senior royals thrashed out details of the couple’s new financially independent role. But they have spoken regularly on the phone., “The Queen has left the door wide open. It’s almost as if she has seen that there is a good chance that their schemes won’t work,” said the royal historian and author Hugo Vickers., The couple are expected to return to Canada, where they left their 10-month-old baby son Archie, shortly after Monday’s service. They will soon announce details of new non-profit organisations., Though they will no longer be official working royals, this is not the last time they will be seen in the UK. They are said to be “absolutely committed” to serving their patronages, which would involve travel to the UK and the Commonwealth, though immediate plans may be affected by restrictions due to coronavirus, it is said., Pictures of Harry, sixth in line to the throne, and Meghan seated behind William and Kate will dominate British media on Monday. “By virtue of being in the second row, it points out Harry is no longer third in line, as he was for quite some time,” said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine., “He will go further down the pecking order, as William and Kate’s children George, Charlotte and Louis grow up and have children of their own. And, rather than let time and Mother Nature play their parts, they have speeded up the process, by stepping back, as they are perfectly entitled to do so., “As far as the Prince of Wales is concerned, he must be pretty devastated by all this,” Little added. Aside from his feelings as a father, Harry and Meghan were a key part of Charles’s plans for a slimmed-down monarchy. “I do think he must be very upset.”harry and meghan duke duchess sussex farewell tour royals", "label": 0}, "train-201": {"text": "\nDespite the experts back in charge, I'm having coronavirus anxiety dreams\n, That’s all people talk about now and I’ve never seen such frantic hand washing in Westminster, Contact author, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 10.57 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 06.56 EDT\n\n, Fiona Bruce has told the Radio Times she has been surprised by the toxicity of the Question Time debates. So I can only assume she had never watched the programme when she agreed to take over the presenter’s role from David Dimbleby. For some years now – not helped by Brexit which still continues to divide the country no matter how much we are told that now is the time for everyone to come together – Question Time has been a bit of a bear-pit with panels, composed of politicians and professional gobshites, and audiences selected for their capacity to kick lumps out of one another. All of which I am sure is entirely deliberate as it’s the rows that pull in the ratings. QT’s prime aim is to attract viewers and get people mouthing off on Twitter, not stimulate intelligent debate. If anyone ends the hour any better informed, then it’s just an added bonus. A politician not abjectly defending a party line, or a business person or pundit making a nuanced argument are the exception. I’ve never been invited to take part in the programme, but even if I were to be I would turn it down. Partly because I wouldn’t want the stress of being in such a pressured situation – my anxiety levels are bad enough on the occasions I punish myself by watching it on TV – but mainly because there are many topics on which I either don’t have a particularly strong opinion or don’t feel sufficiently well-informed to start sounding off. Somehow, I suspect, the producers would be tearing their hair out at a guest whose main contribution was to say, “It’s complicated” or “I don’t really know”., On my way in to No 10 for the coronavirus press conference, I was rather surprised to find I was the only journalist keen to take advantage of the hand sanitiser on offer by the door. No one else seemed that bothered, even when I pointed it out to them. I’m guessing this could be a function of age. Most of my colleagues are much younger than me while I, approaching my mid 60s, am in what the Daily Mail rather unkindly called “the Death Zone”. Last week, I rather prematurely wrote about how – as a professional hypochondriac – I wasn’t that bothered about the coronavirus as there many more deadly conditions to worry about. Well, all that’s now changed and I am regularly waking up in the middle of the night after the most disturbing anxiety dreams. Not least because I didn’t find the Downing Street press conference altogether reassuring. While it was refreshing to have the experts back in charge, with the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty – who wouldn’t rather he was prime minister instead of Boris? – and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, in command of their subject, able to communicate clearly and treating the country as adults, the information they had to share of a possible 80% infection rate and a 1% mortality rate over a six-month period wasn’t what many of us of a certain age were hoping to hear. That’s a possible 600,000 deaths. It’s all rather taken the gloss off this coming weekend’s visit from my son and his girlfriend who are on their way back from holiday. Because I’m now worried he will give me a hug and kill me., We need to talk about Spurs. The season is currently going from bad to worse, with four defeats – three of them at home – on the bounce. Nor is it obvious if the team is capable of improvement. The FA Cup loss to Norwich marked a new low as no one would easily have identified any of the Spurs’ players as professional footballers. The match ended in a penalty shoot out in which Tottenham contrived to take three of the worst spot kicks ever seen anywhere. The last one was a collector’s item. A gentle pass to the opposition keeper that would have struggled to get over the line. Bizarrely, at the end of the game, the manager, José Mourinho, spoke of how brilliant the team had been. In which case, I’d hate to seem them when they were a bit rubbish. I’ve had many low points with Spurs over the years – part of their attraction is their commitment to letting you down – but I haven’t felt this way about them since the late 90s. I am beyond despair and into indifference. I was surprised to find that I genuinely was neither that surprised at nor that bothered by losing to Norwich. And I’m far from alone. Sometimes boos can be heard after a bad defeat: the only reaction among fans near me when the last penalty was missed was laughter. Spurs have somehow contrived to build one of the best new stadiums in the country, yet simultaneously destroy both the atmosphere in the ground and one of the best teams I’ve watched in years. As so often at Tottenham, money is the thing that talks loudest and the club knows there are suckers like me who can be relied on to renew our season tickets – prices inevitably going up, as the football gets worse – just because we always have. The only way my friend Matthew can cope is by losing himself in the virtual world of Championship Manager. Under his guidance, Spurs have just beaten Barcelona, Christian Eriksen is still with the club and is actually trying, and Tanguy Ndombele has played every minute of every game. It may be fantasy, but I – and 60,000 others – would much rather be watching Matthew’s Spurs than Mourinho’s., It’s the little things that count. After I had spent much of the week enviously eyeing up the hand sanitiser lying around on his desk, my friend Rajeev reached into his bag and brought out another bottle and gave it to me. I was totally overwhelmed as you can’t buy the stuff for love nor money anymore. “I want you to live after all,” he said. The nicest words I’d heard in ages. Everyone I know can talk of little but the coronavirus anymore. From those who repeat at length how they “really, really aren’t that worried about it at all” to people like me who fear they might be living on borrowed time. I can’t say I’ve yet heard anyone dolefully singing happy birthday to themselves, but I can report that I’ve never seen such frantic hand washing in the gents toilets in Westminster. The message is clearly getting through now that Boris has been sidelined and the scientific grown-ups are effectively running the country. Whitty was out again before the health select committee to update us on the spread of the virus and plans to contain it. Though he didn’t have much good news to report, he was able to tell committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, there was no point in everyone dressing up in hazmat suits; principally because they are fiendishly difficult to get off and you’re very likely to infect yourself while doing so. Another friend, Kevin, did wonder if Whitty might not have missed a trick. Given that a key part of the advice is for people not to touch their faces – something most of us do the whole time – Kevin wondered if we shouldn’t all be wearing the “cone of shame” that dogs are given to stop them scratching themselves. As the outside of the plastic could also ward off aerial droplets, this could stop the virus in its tracks. It would also have a secondary benefit of protecting dogs. One pooch has already been infected by his owner kissing him., I have enough problems trying to deal with my own mental health, but now it seems I should be paying as much attention to Herbert Hound’s. A Finnish study of more than 13,740 mutts published in the journal Scientific Reports has found that nearly three-quarters of pets display problematic anxiety-related behaviour. Having checked through the symptoms, Herbie appears to be less disturbed than some. I don’t know if he howls when we’re not there – though I dare say if I had an Alexa I could find out – but he doesn’t appear too bothered, as he doesn’t chase his tail or trash the place. Neither is he at all aggressive: quite the reverse in fact. He is completely terrorised by the cats who treat him with contempt. My one area of concern with Herbie is his OCD behaviour, though I rather suspect that could be something he has learned from me. We are both at our happiest when we are doing the same things that we always do. On walks we play the same games with sticks and neither of us ever gets bored of them: precisely because we know how they are going to end. Herbie is also still bewildered that the squirrels he chases can disappear by running up trees. Though that could be because he isn’t that bright. He also likes to sleep in the same place each night: on our bed. Still, I will be doing my best to protect him this weekend by preventing him from watching Crufts on TV. He is a very woke dog and he still hasn’t quite come to terms with me telling him some years ago that cockapoos are no platformed for the elite pedigree competition and only allowed in as a novelty act. So best no one tells him it’s that time of year again., Digested week: “The Return of the Experts”despite the experts back in charge im having coronavirus anxiety dreams", "label": 0}, "train-202": {"text": "\nPlans for infrastructure and climate postponed until after budget\n, Rishi Sunak to delay unveiling strategy for better transport links and net-zero emissions, PA Media, \n\nFri 6 Mar 2020 05.10 EST\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 6 Mar 2020 07.25 EST\n\n, The national infrastructure strategy to invest £100bn in boosting the economy and tackling the climate crisis is expected to be delayed until after the budget., The plan to improve transport connectivity and work towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 had been set to be published “alongside” the budget, which is due on Wednesday., But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who took over at the Treasury last month, is not expected to unveil the plans seen as being crucial to the government’s “levelling up” agenda until a later date., Whitehall sources were unable to say when it would be published, but expected the delay to be only a matter of days or weeks., However, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the delay represented “absolute chaos” in government., “We are facing the threat of climate change and an economy at risk of recession. That’s why we desperately need an immediate start to large-scale infrastructure investment,” he said. “Delaying implementation of investment is unacceptable.”, Sir John Armitt, the chair of the national infrastructure commission, said they were “disappointed” at the delay but expressed confidence that ministers remained committed to infrastructure investment., “Naturally we are disappointed about the further delay in the government’s formal response to the national infrastructure assessment, which we published over 18 months ago,” he said., “However, we are encouraged by the evident focus the government wishes to place on investing in the UK’s future infrastructure., “Prioritising that investment within a long-term plan is key to success and if a short delay leads to a better strategy that more comprehensively addresses our recommendations, it will be worth the wait.”, A Downing Street spokesman said: “It is vital that we give these decisions the proper time and care they deserve.

When I discovered Wales had a language I decided to learn it. If you live in a country, it’s normal to speak that country’s language.”, Gnagbo, who fled persecution in Ivory Coast, worked hard and is now a fluent speaker, playing a lead role in a new campaign to help ensure other asylum seekers and refugees get the chance to learn Welsh., From Friday a group of organisations including the Welsh language society, Cymdeithas yr Iaith, and the Welsh Refugee Council is piloting a scheme under which 300 adult asylum seekers and refugees will get the chance to learn Welsh for free., The scheme will involve both online learning and face-to-face practice. As well as picking up a potentially useful skill, the idea is that people taking part will meet new friends and have their eyes opened to a culture they may not have known existed., Gnagbo fled Ivory Coast after recording a rap warning against rebel forces just before they took over his city. He spent time in south-east England before being settled in Wales., He began to learn Welsh in the Oasis centre for refugees and asylum seekers in Cardiff. “I loved it,” he said. “People could see I was devoted to it and I was encouraged to keep on learning. I was lucky.”, Gnagbo now works as a carer and a teacher, and volunteers for Cymdeithas yr Iaith. He also gives half-hour Welsh language taster sessions at the Welsh Refugee Council – after learners have had an hour of English tuition. “But everyone should have the chance to learn,” he said., There is frustration from some language campaigners at what they see as a lack of provision in Wales for refugees to learn the country’s language. The Welsh government funds free English classes for asylum seekers and refugees. It does offer Welsh lessons for asylum seekers, but not for refugees. Refugees who want to learn have to seek out free classes given by volunteers, which can be hard to find, or pay for them., “The policy must change if the Welsh government is going to stick to its commitment to make Wales a genuine sanctuary nation,” said Gnagbo., Teachers of Welsh describe the joy many asylum seekers and refugees experience when they learn Welsh. Deborah McCarney, of SaySomethingInWelsh, which will lead the course, said: “A lot of people find learning the language opens up a parallel culture. We hope it will help refugees and asylum seekers feel they are part of the whole community.”, Dr Gwennan Higham, a Welsh language teacher and lecturer at Swansea University, said there was a school of thought that resources should be focused on teaching newcomers English. “But we are a bilingual nation. Every person has the right to learn Welsh as well as English,” she said., “Learning Welsh is not just about the language. It’s about community as well, encouraging refugees and asylum seekers to learn about life here.”, Higham said often newcomers to Wales were excellent and enthusiastic Welsh learners. “Many are already multilinguists. They hear Welsh, they see it on signs, they want to learn.”, She said there were similarities between Welsh and some languages – such as Arabic – and speakers of some minority languages identified with the struggle that keeping Welsh alive has sometimes been. “It opens doors for many people,” she said., One driving force for adult learners is the desire to be able to keep up with children who are taught Welsh in school. A mother from south Wales, who fled persecution in Iraq, said she had been so moved by her teenage son learning Welsh that she had sought out classes. “We’ve been given sanctuary here,” said the woman, who asked not to be named. “So it’s right that we learn the language. For me and my son it’s just natural.”, Osian Rhys, of Cymdeithas yr Iaith, said the new scheme added to the important voluntary work happening on the ground to extend Welsh language opportunities to refugees and asylum seekers, adding: “There should be a warm Welsh language welcome for all who come to live here.”, A spokesman for the Welsh government said: “Through work with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, we provide support for learners from all backgrounds to learn Welsh, with the centre offering free courses for asylum seekers., “We fully support efforts such as the partnership in examining all possibilities to help refugees and asylum seekers to learn the language of their choice.”i was lucky the asylum seeker campaigning for others to learn welsh", "label": 0}, "train-204": {"text": "\n'Misleading and alarming': behind Sheffield's coronavirus figures\n, City’s statistics look bad, but there are reasons why people should not be unduly worried, \nHelen Pidd North of England editor, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 13.04 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Apr 2020 14.37 EDT\n\n, For residents of Sheffield, the daily roll call of coronavirus cases has made for alarming reading. On Wednesday the Steel City had the fourth highest number in any local authority in England (541), behind Surrey (571), Hampshire (652) and Birmingham (734)., The figures have led some to worry that Sheffield – home to 575,400 people, compared with Birmingham’s 1.1 million – has become a hotbed of disease. Research from the Centre for Cities on Tuesday prompted further consternation by breaking the data down by population size and reporting that Sheffield was second only to London in terms of cases per 100,000 people., But local hospitals and public health experts are playing down the statistics. “The figures are misleading and alarming. People look at them and think, ‘Oh gosh, we’re all going to get it’ and ‘Sheffield is a high-risk area’, but that’s not true,” said Dr Andrew Lee, a reader of global public health at Sheffield University and executive director of primary care and population health at NHS Vale of York clinical commissioning group., So far, 21 patients have died in hospitals in Sheffield, while the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust, which operates the city’s two big hospitals, the Northern General and the Royal Hallamshire, says they are currently treating “a comparatively low level” of coronavirus patients., Talking in his academic capacity, Lee despaired at the Public Health England daily dashboard, which lists the number of cases in each local authority in England. “That tracker is really misleading. In some senses they should just turn it off because everywhere is testing differently. So you can’t compare place A with place B with place C. And it’s not like you’re just following a score because the interpretation of those numbers is really complicated,” he said., The main reason Sheffield has such a high number of cases is that it has been testing more people and testing earlier, according to Lee. The Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust took the decision to test all symptomatic NHS workers 11 days before most other areas, the Guardian understands., From 19 March, any Northern General staff with symptoms were instructed to phone occupational health and – assuming they had their own transport and weren’t going to use public transport – were given an appointment for a test, according to a medic from the Northern General. That hospital has a larger than average in-house testing laboratory, which when it opened in 2013 was able to process more than 10m tests a year. And at the start of March, local authorities set up a temporary drive-through community testing facility just off the Sheffield Parkway where members of the public who had visited affected countries could be tested without leaving their cars., It was only this week that the rest of the NHS was ordered by Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, to start testing staff, starting with those working in critical care, emergency departments and ambulance services., Healthcare workers were disproportionately likely to get infected, said Lee. “If you look at what happened with Mers-Covid, when they had that big outbreak in South Korea some years ago, most of the cases were in health workers. And the same with Sars in 2003-4. It just reflects the fact healthcare workers have high-risk, prolonged contacts with patients. Healthcare workers are not representative of the wider public.”, The Northern General medic said the widespread testing in Sheffield meant that infected staff stayed at home while those who tested negative could come in to work. “I know five or six people in my team were sure they had it and tested negative, and yet a few others who were adamant it was just a cold turned out to have coronavirus,” they said., Another reason for Sheffield’s high figures is that the Royal Hallamshire is home to one of England’s few specialist NHS infection centres. That is why, when the first coronavirus patients arrived in the UK from the cruise ship the Diamond Princess, two were sent there., In addition, Sheffield has experienced a few “Covid clusters”, according to a spokeswoman at the hospitals trust. “I know we did have some clusters of people that we tested in the community, which had a wide contract testing base, which made the Sheffield figures look larger,” she said. These clusters were largely groups returning from Italy and other infected regions, she added., She said the trust saw two million patients each year – four times the population of Sheffield – but that they were not currently treating many Covid-19 patients., ”The number of patients fluctuates each day, but we are at a comparatively low level at present. We currently have capacity in our ITU intensive treatment unit and HDU high dependency unit and have plans in place to increase capacity as the number of cases rise,” she said., “It’s a bit like watching the tide go out before the tsunami comes in,” said the Northern General medic. “We are not overwhelmed yet, but we have all seen what has happened in London and we know what’s coming. We are hoping the lockdown will make it not as bad, but it depends who you talk to how much you believe whether we are going to be saved or not.” misleading and alarming sheffields coronavirus figures", "label": 0}, "train-205": {"text": "\nFirst British rescue flight set to depart as part of £75m operation\n, About 400,000 Britons are still stranded overseas hoping to be brought back to the UK, \nLisa O'Carroll in London and \nPatrick Greenfield in Costa Rica, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 12.36 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Apr 2020 15.07 EDT\n\n, The first charter flight in the £75m coronavirus rescue operation will leave Algeria on 2 April, with departures from South Africa, Nepal and India to follow., As the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, continue negotiations to get a series of charter flights to help the most vulnerable stranded UK nationals, British embassies around the world disclosed details of operations under way.

But HS2 Ltd agreed in official plans published as part of the hybrid parliamentary bill authorising the high-speed line that it would conduct soil translocation in winter, when plants and trees are dormant, to minimise damage., “Everything is growing in April. It’s completely the wrong time to be doing this and HS2 know it’s the wrong time to be doing this,” said Luci Ryan of the Woodland Trust., There is one study of the efficacy of soil translocation in establishing new woods in Britain and Ryan said there was as yet no evidence it would be successful in the long term. She also said the contractor undertaking the translocation in Warwickshire had never performed such work before., She added: “We’ve engaged with the hybrid bill process all the way through. HS2 has promised at various stages that they will do X or Y and we’ve taken it in good faith. When it comes to doing the works, they’ve said they are actually doing A or B. It’s heartbreaking and it’s a betrayal of trust., “It’s a government-backed project. It should be done to the highest possible standards. If a government project is doing things wrong, what does that say to other developers?”, Five campaigners have spent the past week living up trees in Crackley Wood in an attempt to halt the destruction, with HS2 “enabling” works to continue despite the coronavirus crisis., Joe Rukin, a spokesperson for Stop HS2, claimed the destruction of bird-nest habitat was happening “on an industrial scale” in ancient woodlands “in a desperate attempt to claw back some time” after delays to the £106bn railway., He added: “HS2 don’t seem to have noticed that the whole country is on standstill. Covid-19 has handed HS2 the opportunity to do the right thing and delay the works but instead HS2 have done exactly the wrong thing. They’ve seen it as an opportunity to make sure no one witnesses their actions.”, The naturalist Chris Packham has requested an emergency injunction to halt HS2 construction works this spring until his proposed judicial review challenging the government’s decision to proceed with the railway can be heard in the high court., HS2 said it had deferred work on five ancient woodlands until winter 2020 but could not delay works on six woods, including Broadwells and Crackley., In a statement, it said the soil translocation was a “best practice approach” and added: “Our works programme needs to proceed as planned in order to avoid further delays and additional costs to the taxpayer … HS2 recognises the challenges of undertaking such works at this time of the year and we still feel there is value in undertaking such an approach, and will be responding to the Woodland Trust on this matter.”, Potential emissions, Construction:, • Huge quantities of steel and concrete including concrete slab-track, • Moving construction materials to site, • Tunnelling (more carbon-intensive than open-air construction), • Construction machines, • Removing soil by truck, • Manufacture of rolling stock, • Journey to work of HS2 employees, Operation:, • Power source not guaranteed to be renewable.

It said: “HS2 Ltd contractors are keenly aware of the law around nesting birds, and during nesting season an ecologist is present during all habitat clearance work in order to spot nesting birds and stop work where necessary.”, HS2 said all bat roosts would be identified and inspected before work and trees would only be felled once an ecologist had confirmed no bats were present., Of the ancient woodlands affected by the railway in Warwickshire, HS2 said about 86.5% would remain intact and unaffected.

The inquiry also did not see any evidence of the expected liaison with the FCO and UK or local authorities.”, The Charity Commission said Al-Fatiha Global’s trustees failed to “properly safeguard their volunteers by failing to exercise any due diligence or risk management procedures, to provide any meaningful training, instructions and/or guidance to its volunteers”., It said the trustees also failed to make sure its funds were only used to support, put in place adequate financial controls – despite its income rocketing from £4,000 to £1.2m between 2012 and 2013 – and failed to protect its volunteers, assets and property., Al-Fatiha Global has been contacted for a response.uk charity failed to safeguard aid worker killed in syria report alan henning", "label": 0}, "train-209": {"text": "\nScotland drops plans to suspend jury trials during coronavirus crisis\n, Michael Gove urged Nicola Sturgeon to reconsider ‘deeply concerning’ proposals, \nSeverin Carrell Scotland editor, \n\nWed 1 Apr 2020 05.40 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 1 Apr 2020 14.25 EDT\n\n, The Scottish government has dropped plans to suspend jury trials for up to 18 months during the coronavirus lockdown after an outcry from lawyers, Scottish National party MPs and UK cabinet ministers., Mike Russell, the Scottish constitutional affairs secretary, told MSPs the proposals had been withdrawn because of complaints and would start urgent talks with other parties, victims organisations and the legal profession on alternative options., At the start of a debate on emergency legislation to help public services cope with the coronavirus crisis, Russell said new measures would be tabled at Holyrood’s next sitting on 21 April after “intensive and wide-ranging discussions on alternatives”., Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, confirmed on Tuesday that her government wanted to suspend jury trials to ensure courts were able to hold trials in the most serious cases during the coronavirus lockdown., The proposals were backed by Lord Carloway, the lord justice general, Scotland’s most senior judge, who said the judicial system would be overwhelmed unless the courts were allowed to carry on with significant cases., However, the proposals were condemned from across the legal profession and faced significant opposition from other parties at Holyrood, which threatened to break the political consensus on responding to the pandemic., The bill, which is due to be passed in a single sitting, also includes temporary measures to allow the early release of prisoners to relieve pressure on prisons; allowing councils to evict dementia patients from hospital beds without their consent; and a ban on landlords evicting tenants who cannot afford their rent., In a further policy reversal, the Scottish government indicated it was amending plans to dramatically relax the rules and deadlines on freedom of information requests after advice from the Scottish information commissioner., The Law Society of Scotland, which represents solicitors, said early on Wednesday it understood the need for extraordinary measures during the crisis but said the case for one of the most dramatic changes to the legal system ever considered had not been made., John Mulholland, the society’s president, said there was “deep concern” across the profession after the Scottish criminal bar association, which represents court room lawyers of all ranks, denounced them on Tuesday as “premature, disproportionate and ill advised”., “We fully appreciate the desire to avoid any backlog in cases which might interfere with the proper administration of justice. However, we have not reached that point and so there is not sufficient justification to warrant trials without jury for serious criminal offences,” Mulholland said., Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, urged Sturgeon to reconsider the “deeply concerning” proposals. In a tweet, he said: “I applaud the Scottish government for their generous co-operation in the fight against Covid-19 but is it wise to take this position on jury trials?

Test centres must be as convenient as possible to enable health workers to attend easily without adding further risks as they travel,” said Sara Gorton, head of health at the staff union Unison., There was also some disappointment that the tests would not give staff an overnight green light to return to work. Most were told to expect results in three days’ time., One nurse who had been self-isolating for 10 days said she was relieved to have been tested, but had hoped to be cleared to return to work sooner. “I want to go back to work, but I will have to wait longer now,” said the nurse, who works at the nearby Park Royal Centre for Mental Health., “Speed is of the essence with results, to ensure staff who’re negative can get back to treating patients, and that tests remain valid. Locations, wait times and frequency of testing are among the many issues that need urgent attention,” said Gorton., It is estimated that as many as 20% of the NHS workforce need testing urgently as they are either self-isolating because they have experienced symptoms or someone in their household is suspected as having the virus., But just over 5,000 of 500,000 health workers in England have been tested because of the lack of diagnostic facilities in the UK compared to countries like Germany, health secretary Matt Hancock conceded., Test sites will be rolled out across the country in the next week but so far the government has not disclosed their location., In Northern Ireland, the transport minister revealed she would make MOT centres available, while in Wales a new centre at the Rodney Parade rugby stadium in Newport will be used for testing., Hancock pledged to quadruple the testing target to 100,000 a week by the end of April and revealed the government would be teaming up with Boots and Amazon which can bring logistics heft to the coronavirus battle., The lack of testing and supply of personal protection equipment has been the source of significant stress for those at the centre of the crisis., One doctor who got tested at the Wembley centre on Thursday, said he worked “at the heart” of the crisis Northwick Park Hospital. “There hasn’t been enough testing, and it is definitely causing stress and anxiety,” he said., The testing centre in the Ikea car park dealt briskly with the long queues, with marshals estimating they had dealt with 180 in the first hour and a half, putting it on course to collect swabs from around 1,000 people over the course of the day., But there was some confusion, and one nurse was initially turned away after making the 10-mile journey.

Please do not leave your home unless absolutely necessary. It really will save lives.”, Ten days into the formal lockdown, Andy Slattery, assistant chief constable of Cumbria, said he was concerned that “boredom and frustration” were setting in and people were getting back into their cars, ignoring guidance to exercise locally., Though the number of visitors to the Lake District had dropped, police were still having to tell day-trippers to go home. “We’ve stopped and spoken to day-trippers from the north-east and the north-west thinking it’s still OK to come to the Lake District – it isn’t.”, He added: “I am worried that people who had decided to stay at home, now a week, 10 days in, may be thinking they’ll just get in the car and go here or there.”, In London messages will be pumped out on social media from Friday urging people to resist the capital’s forecast mini-heatwave and stay inside., Police forces across the country were assessing intelligence and briefing officers on patrol about making sure there was no slippage in the lockdown at the weekend. One senior officer told the Guardian the bigger concern was Easter weekend, when forces were considering boosting patrols dedicated to policing the lockdown., There remains a nagging concern among police about how long the public will observe the draconian restrictions. The concern is that over time the level of compliance will dip.,  Prof Ivo Vlaev, a behavioural change scientist at Warwick Business School and a government adviser, said he did not expect violations of the guidance on the basis of what he knew, and from previous research., Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days., If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home., After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start. Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days., If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days., If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible., After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine., If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal., If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone., Staying at home means you should:, You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people., If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do., Source: NHS England on 23 March 2020, “What we know is that with compelling narrative and reasons, people are capable of maintaining remarkable solidarity over long periods of times of national crisis, especially when the narrative is a collective narrative. And, in fact, we know from evidence that panic is much less likely behaviour. In fact more likely behaviours are related to cooperation and altruism and solidarity.”, Research on the effectiveness of school closures in previous epidemics shows children, especially teenagers, continued to leave home and socialise despite public health recommendations., A team from King’s College London reviewed 19 studies of school closures from different countries around the world during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic and other influenza-like outbreaks. Schools then were closed for a far shorter time than is likely during the current crisis, from one day to a maximum of two weeks., The research found that though children’s interactions with others reduced significantly during the closure, social contact with others outside the home remained common., Some of the studies featured adolescents leaving their homes to meet friends and go to parties and fast food restaurants. One UK study of school closures during the H1N1 outbreak found that 98% of children left their homes during the closure., Commenting on the study, Andrea Danese, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s, said: “This timely review suggests that school closure can be effective to reduce social interaction and, thus, the spread of infection. However, the review also clearly suggests that, for such top-down measures to be effective, children and families cannot simply be seen as passive recipients of government decisions.”sunshine uk weather health officials stay home lockdown", "label": 0}, "train-215": {"text": "\nArron Banks fails in effort to use European laws to avoid £162,000 tax bill\n, HMRC says millionaire owes money for inheritance tax liability on Ukip donations, \nOwen Bowcott Legal affairs correspondent, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 11.16 EDT\n\n\nFirst published on Thu 2 Apr 2020 11.14 EDT\n\n, Arron Banks, the businessman and Ukip party donor, has failed in his attempt to use human rights laws to dismiss a £162,000 tax bill., The Brexit-backing millionaire has been resisting an HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) assessment that he owes the money for an inheritance tax liability on political donations to Ukip., Banks, one of the self-styled “bad boys of Brexit”, gave almost £1m in donations to the party between October 2014 and March 2015., A written ruling by the upper tribunal delivered on Wednesday noted that donations to political parties that have two MPs elected at the previous general election, or one MP elected and a total of 150,000 votes, are exempt from inheritance tax., While Ukip did receive 919,471 votes across the UK in the 2010 general election, the party did not return a single MP to the House of Commons. Consequently HMRC billed Banks for £162,945.34., Banks challenged the decision at the first-tier tribunal, arguing the law on political donations being exempt from inheritance tax breached both his human rights and EU law. , He claimed the provisions of the Inheritance Tax Act were unlawfully discriminatory under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and also breached his – and Ukip’s – right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly under the convention., He further argued that the imposition of a tax charge on the donations involved a breach of the UK’s obligations regarding the Treaty on European Union., The initial tribunal dismissed his challenge in November 2018 and Banks took his case to the upper tribunal, which has rejected his appeal., Mrs Justice Falk ruled the difference in treatment between Banks and an individual who donated to a political party with two MPs, or one MP and which received more than 150,000 votes, was not discriminatory under European human rights law., She also ruled that the first-tier tribunal was wrong to have found that the difference in treatment was discriminatory on the grounds of his political opinion., The judge said the provisions of the Inheritance Tax Act were proportionate in the pursuit of “a rational and legitimate aim”, namely “to provide tax relief on donations to political parties that are participating in parliamentary democracy by being represented in the House of Commons”., Dismissing Banks’s contention that the law on inheritance tax exemption unlawfully interfered with his rights to freedom of expression and assembly, the judge added: “The existence of a tax charge does not obviously restrict the expression of any opinion or the ability to associate, whether with Ukip or anyone else., “There was also no evidence to support the argument that Mr Banks was in fact deterred from expressing opinions or supporting Ukip, whether by making donations or otherwise.”, • This article was amended on 3 April 2020 to add details about the area of EU law which Arron Banks claimed had been breached.arron banks fails to use european laws to avoid paying 162000 tax bill", "label": 0}, "train-216": {"text": "\nMan held over death of woman found near Plaistow church\n, Metropolitan police say man, 21, in custody on suspicion of murdering Kelly Stewart, 41, PA Media, \n\nThu 2 Apr 2020 02.58 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 2 Apr 2020 05.18 EDT\n\n, Police investigating the murder of a 41-year-old woman in east London last week have arrested a man., The Metropolitan police said a 21-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of murdering Kelly Stewart and remains in custody at an east London police station., Officers were called last Thursday afternoon after a body was found in the grounds of Memorial Community church in Barking Road, Plaistow.

The court will not be seduced into treating that as an insignificant consideration.”, He argued that Packham and others had already had plenty of opportunity to make arguments about HS2’s environmental impact while the railway was scrutinised by both chambers of parliament, which passed the act enabling HS2 in 2017., Packham, who crowdfunded £100,000 for the challenge, said: “I’m immensely disappointed on behalf of all the wildlife that will now be destroyed in the next few weeks and the irreversible damage to the woodlands. These trees are going to come crashing to the ground and all the birds nesting in them and bats roosting in them are going to die and nobody is going to know anything about it., “Our nation will be robbed of some of our greatest national natural treasures over the next few days for an entirely fallacious vanity project.”, During the hearing, David Wolf QC, for Packham, argued that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was not given all the information required to make an informed decision on HS2 by the Oakervee review, which was led by the former HS2 chair Doug Oakervee., He told the courts the works would cause “irretrievable and irreversible” harm to ancient woodlands. HS2 Ltd contractors are clearing trees and soil from five ancient woodlands in Warwickshire during April, despite the Woodland Trust condemning the timing and the RSPB warning that bird nests would almost certainly be destroyed., HS2 has said temporary exclusion zones are being put around all nests discovered by its ecologists until the chicks are fledged, and contractors were “keenly aware of the law around nesting birds”., Wolf told the court that Oakervee’s review failed to properly consider HS2’s environmental impact or the railway being a net contributor to carbon emissions during construction. Wolf said the emissions produced by all the concrete required during construction would cause emissions of 8-14m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which would contravene Britain’s legal obligations to reduce its emissions under the Paris climate agreement., He argued that hearing the review would not unduly delay HS2 because if it was to abide by the law its contractors would not be able to continue with the clearance of ancient woodland. “This woodland will now already be full of nesting birds and it is a criminal offence to interfere with those nesting birds. Their ability to proceed in this nesting season period is already heavily compromised,” he told the court., Dr Darren Moorcroft, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, which provided an expert witness statement criticising HS2’s “translocation” of ancient woodland soils during April, said: “To say we are disappointed by this outcome is an understatement. This decision is catastrophic for these irreplaceable ancient woodlands and the hundreds of species that call them home. Instead if bursting into life they will now be destroyed. , “The flawed and invariably unsuccessful process of translocation will be carried out at completely the wrong time of year, flying in the face of professional standards and HS2’s original assurance that they’d do it when they should – when everything is dormant. Nature and the environment are the big losers today.”, A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “We are pleased with today’s verdict. While our current priority is combating the spread of coronavirus, we must continue our work to level up the country. HS2 will be crucial to that ambition, boosting capacity and connectivity across our rail network., “We have tasked HS2 Ltd with delivering one of the UK’s most environmentally responsible infrastructure projects.”, Packham and his lawyers, Leigh Day, will be able to consider the grounds for an appeal when the judges publish their written reasons for the verdict on Monday.hs2 ancient wood clearance go ahead chris packham legal bid fails", "label": 0}, "train-221": {"text": "\nBoris Johnson says he still has 'minor symptoms' of the coronavirus – video\n, The prime minister has given an update on his coronavirus diagnosis, saying he is 'feeling better but still experiencing minor symptoms', a temperature, and will maintain self-isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 last week.

Ward, 72, was jailed in December 2011 for indecent exposure and weapons offences after police found a huge haul of weapons including a loaded Luger pistol under his pillow and the cockpit of a second world war fighter plane with working machine guns at his remote cottage., On Tuesday up to six officers began digging up a plot at Appletree Cottage in Chop Gate on the edge of the North York Moors national park. Police said they were working with a forensic archaeologist, after the discovery of suspected human bones. It is understood the cottage is now in the hands of new owners, but was previously owned by Ward’s family for more than 300 years., A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said: “Although it is too early to say precisely how old these bones are, current forensic investigations suggest they are not recent and are likely to be several decades old. Specialists are being used to recover and examine them., “We’d ask people not to speculate online about the nature of the bones while this process is under way.”, Ward’s neighbour Mandy Dunford said police arrived three days ago and there had been a lot of activity ever since. “They are searching the property and people in the Dale have been told that human remains have been found,” she said. “It’s very concerning.”, Dunford, 59, suffered a nine-year campaign of intimidation from Ward, who would creep around her property naked, sometimes dressed only in military boots, shouldering a rifle., She revealed her ordeal in 2015 after Ward was released from prison and tried to move back to his home – but was prevented from doing so after intervention from the current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, Dunford’s MP., Dunford said of Ward: “That man put me through hell, and even though he was prevented from coming back here I can’t seem to shake off his memory.” , Ward, an eccentric military expert, was arrested after police discovered a huge cache of bombs and live weaponry at his cottage. RAF bomb squad officers were brought in to carry out controlled explosions on the moorland above his isolated home., Ward was subsequently jailed at Teesside crown court after admitting 11 counts of exposure, three charges of possessing a prohibited firearm and seven other firearms offences., At the time Dunford, a retired police officer, said Ward’s behaviour became increasingly erratic after the death of his brother, Brian, in 2002., She said: “He first started exposing himself to me around 2002 and would peer in through my windows with his wild staring eyes. He would run around the house at night, shouting and tapping on the windows. When I was working during the day he would come right up to me and follow me around wearing nothing but boots and socks., “Sometimes he would climb a ladder and expose himself over the wall of his cottage, and once he confronted me on the lane and aimed a rifle at me. I turned and ran and heard five shots go off behind me, I was terrified., “He had a favourite stone on the lane next to my house where he used to stand to watch me with his pants down and shirt pulled up. He would stand there for hours and hours every day. Terrorising me became the only focus of his life. I went to the police to report him but their response was hopeless.”, Five North Yorkshire police officers were subsequently reprimanded after an internal disciplinary inquiry concluded they failed to meet “appropriate investigatory standards”.human remains found at former home of kenneth ward yorkshire", "label": 0}, "train-223": {"text": "\nDesperately seeking beauty and calm in coronavirus lockdown\n, Panic buying therapy sessions and admiring ceramics has just about got me through the week, Contact author, \n\nFri 3 Apr 2020 08.47 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Fri 3 Apr 2020 10.10 EDT\n\n, All of the supermarkets near us have introduced a “one in, one out” policy to enforce physical distancing for the safety of both staff and customers. So far it is working well. After last week’s mania, the queues – even at two metres apart – have not been too bad and waiting times less than expected. Either people have realised their fridges and cupboards only have a finite amount of space, or they have accepted that the lockdown is likely to last longer than any amount of food they are likely to be able to hoard so there is no point in any further shopping. At least for a week or two. We are currently eating our way through various vegetables that are fast approaching their sell-by date. Last night’s mixture of soggy carrots, courgettes, onions and peas, all blended together and then fried in sunflower oil was a new low. Though obviously slightly enhanced by a sense of moral superiority., The only thing I am still panic buying is therapy sessions. Here, I am cashing in all the Nectar points I have accrued over more than 30 years. If there is one advantage to having been on the mental health at-risk register for half my life, it’s that I have a therapist and psychiatrist who are there for me when I most need them. I am currently having three half-hour sessions with my therapist each week and one session every three weeks with my shrink to monitor my meds. I couldn’t manage without them and feel for all those who are stressed out and cannot get help. My therapist friend Debby says she has never been so inundated with people referring themselves, and neither she nor her colleagues have the capacity to see them all., Even with all this extra support, my mental health can still only best be described as extremely ropey. Mornings are still by far the worst as I struggle to uncurl from foetal terror into something approaching a functioning human being. Even though I know that the best thing is to get out of bed as soon as possible, it still takes me a good 45 minutes before I can drag myself out from under the duvet. The one change to my routine is that the dog has started joining in with me as I do my first set of press-ups of the day to ease the physical anxiety in my body. At this rate, he could become the most ripped cockapoo on Tooting Common by the time the partial lockdown is over. He’s yet to join me on my daily Church Lane Challenge – six repetitions of the same half-mile hill. My friend Kevin reckons I should wear a GoPro on my helmet to start a cult YouTube group for the most boring exercise regime of all time., The rest of the day is merely competing waves of anxiety that everything is going to be a disaster and windows of hope that it won’t be as bad as I feared. You can probably guess which waves are the largest. It hasn’t helped that my concentration levels are completely shot. I must have read the first three pages of Hilary Mantel’s The Mirror and the Light about 10 times now. It goes without saying they are three very brilliant pages, but it would be nice to be able to make some progress. Not least because I have Hadley Freeman’s House of Glass and Maggie O’Farrell’s Hamnet stacked up by my bed waiting to be read., I’m guessing that someone in Downing Street is now bitterly regretting the decision to hold daily coronavirus briefings. For what was intended to show that the government was well on top of the situation has merely highlighted the exact opposite. Time and again ministers are asked straightforward questions to which they are unable to offer direct answers, because the simple truth is that the government has been caught well and truly on the hop and has been forced to change policy after a week. From as early as mid-January, all the evidence suggested the coronavirus was heading our way, and yet the government was far more interested in whether the Big Ben bongs would ring for Brexit and taking a 10-day half-term break during recess. There’s no way of knowing if the preparations would have made any difference, but at least it would have shown the government did give a toss., It also hasn’t helped that, with Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock out of action, the government has had to rely on a B-list of ministers to do the front-of-house stuff at the press conferences. Dominic Raab merely radiated instability while Michael Gove pleading for trust was irony overload. With most other ministers instantly disqualified on grounds of either stupidity or levitas – think Priti Patel, Liz Truss or Grant Shapps – today’s briefing was led by Alok Sharma, whom not even members of his department are aware is the business secretary. Still, at least we have Hancock back tomorrow. Though I have frequently made fun of the inverse relationship between his Tiggerishness and effectiveness, I am quite fond of him as he is definitely a minister who means well and I sent him a message saying so, along with hopes for a speedy recovery. He replied asking me not to mention this to anyone as it would ruin both our careers., My tech levels have now improved so much, I am not only able to operate a spreadsheet – I am busy cataloguing my books, a slow process as after four days I am only up to authors filed under E – but I can also master Zoom and Houseparty on my iPad. Talking to my daughter and son, along with their partners, is a bittersweet experience. It both brings me close to them, yet reminds me of how distant we are. Like so many other people, I have no idea when I will next see them., Curiously, though, my TV viewing has actually dropped off. I no longer even bother flicking to the sports challenge as I have zero interest in watching repeats of games that were played years before and whose results I already know. Precisely the reason I seldom bothered watching Match of the Day. Just about the only games I might be bothered to watch are virtual ones on Fifa. At least the ones being played with my friend Matthew as manager, because miraculously Spurs are through to their second Champions League final in two years. Despite having been abjectly knocked out by Leipzig., Other programmes have also taken a hit. I’m usually a sucker for documentaries such as Hospital and 24 Hours in A&amp;E, but I find these far too scary these days. The same applies to the news and most dramas. I’ve even had to give up on Belgravia, though only because we tried to watch it on ITV catchup and the sound was completely out of synch with the pictures. What TV is going to look like this summer and autumn is anyone’s guess. Summer is usually wall-to-wall sport, all of which has been cancelled, and all of the autumn dramas are not being filmed due to the lockdown. Stand by for yet more repeats of Pointless., Thursday night’s Downing Street press conference went on rather longer than usual, so I only managed to finish the sketch just after 8pm. Which meant I was a little late for the clapping for the NHS in our street, though I did get down in time for the tail-end of it. There were no klaxons from the flats across the road this time, which was slightly disappointing – though Herbert Hound did try to make up for this with a few well-timed barks – but the sense of community gratitude was still very much present. The only slight odd note was the runner who raced past us all as if she felt the applause was all for her. Maybe she had just done a personal best., As regular readers will know, I’m not generally the most fun bloke to be around but I’m determined that during the partial lockdown I will try to end each week’s diary with something vaguely positive. So here goes. I loved the stories of the goats invading Llandudno and the wild boars roaming the streets of a French village, so I’ve been trying to think what I would most like to see on Tooting Common. Top of the list, given that my trip to Brownsea Island has now been cancelled, would be for a colony of red squirrels to make the train journey to London to take up residence. Failing that, I think some orangutans in the woods would be fun., I’m also thrilled that the Paris Opera is going to be streaming its recent production of The Barber of Seville. At one point last December I dreamed of going over for the weekend to see it as the divine Lisette Oropesa was singing Rosina, but inertia won the day. This will be a good second best. But the thing that still gives me most pleasure is just staring at our collection of ceramics. A few years ago, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge had a stunning exhibition called Things of Beauty Growing. I now realise I had only half understood the title. Because the closer I look at our pots, the more their beauty grows., Digested week, digested: The return of Hancock’s half-hour.

Walking, cycling and car and van journeys are all down by about three-quarters, while bus numbers have fallen by 60%. The number of large lorries has declined by just 40% as essential supplies continue to be transported., However, national data from Monday and Tuesday, the two most recent days available, shows a slight upward trend since the previous week, with motor traffic down only 63%, equivalent to 1962. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, called the trend concerning. “Please follow medical and scientific advice to stay home and save lives,” he said., The empty streets have already resulted in big drops in air pollution, which is likely to reduce early deaths from lung and heart conditions. Traffic deaths and injuries are near certain to have fallen, but data is not yet available. Noise pollution, which is also known to have adverse affects on human health, is down, and the quieter streets have encouraged wildlife to venture into some towns., Cabinet Office data shows motor traffic dropped by 73% on 29 March compared with pre-outbreak levels. Guardian analysis shows the number of road miles travelled has not been this low since 1955, when far fewer people owned cars and there were no motorways. The government data also shows rail travel down 90%, and tube and bus journeys in London down by 94% and 83% respectively., Some experts suggest that people who have learned how to work effectively from home may continue to do so for a day or two a week after the Covid-19 crisis is over. This could help tackle the climate emergency, because the transport sector is the biggest emitter and the only one to have increased its emissions in recent years. Others, however, say emissions could rise again if the coronavirus lockdown causes lasting financial damage to public transport services., Detailed data from Vivacity, a video analysis company, shows that pedestrian, bicycle and car journeys in urban areas started falling a few days after the government announced it was moving from the contain to the delay phase of its pandemic response on 12 March. Bus, van and large HGV trips started falling later, after Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown on 23 March., The data shows large HGV traffic actually rose significantly in the week before the lockdown. “We interpret that as, because people were suddenly panic buying, they needed to do many more deliveries to shops across the country,” Vivacity’s CEO, Mark Nicholson, said., Cyclist numbers fell more slowly than those for pedestrians, who often arrive in city centres on public transport. This may be because some people switched to cycling, either to avoid crowded buses and trains or because of sunny weather., Nicholson said people may continue to work from home at least some of the time in future. “If that manages to decrease traffic on the roads then that would be a great outcome from an environmental perspective,” he said., Vivacity’s data comes from its network of hundreds of cameras in urban areas across England, including Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Oxford, Cambridge, Peterborough, Bournemouth and on the M32. Most cameras are on busy streets, so do not monitor traffic in residential areas., The company uses AI software installed in the cameras to analyse video footage of traffic, generating data that helps local authorities to plan traffic management. No images of faces are stored and numberplate data is erased every 24 hours., Claire Haigh, the CEO of Greener Journeys, said the big fall in revenue for public transport services might damage its viability in the longer term, with bus and coach travel already in decline before the virus struck as people shop more online., “Any expected fall in transport emissions this year as a result of the lockdown will be short-lived if it does lasting damage to public transport systems,” she said. “A double-decker bus can take 75 cars off the road.” The government announced £167m in new funding on Friday to support bus services over the next 12 weeks. “It’s absolutely vital we do all we can to keep the sector running,” Shapps said., Highways England, which operates the country’s motorways and A-roads, said traffic on its network had fallen by about half since the Covid-19 crisis began. The AA, which is providing free cover to NHS workers, said recovery callouts had fallen by a third, though the number of flat batteries had risen as cars sat idle., Data on deaths and serious injuries from road traffic incidents is only available from 2018, during which an average of 34 people died each week and 490 suffered serious injuries., At 80 years old, Winston Churchill was in his final year as prime minister, and just over five million cars and vans were registered in 1955, compared with 36m in 2019. Many of the marques on the road then have since been lost, from Allard and Alvis to Riley and Singer. , The year was not without travel problems. A snow storm in February blocked many roads and train tracks and a long rail strike led to the declaration of a state of emergency in May., In politics, Anthony Eden replaced Churchill, who retired, and the long-standing Labour leader, Clement Attlee, was replaced by Hugh Gaitskell. Evelyn Sharp became the first female permanent secretary in the civil service, but women were still barred from the House of Lords., Child benefit payments had been in place for 10 years, but the contraceptive pill did not become available on the NHS until 1961 and the Equal Pay Act was still 15 years away., Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Kim Philby were named as Soviet spies, and Ruth Ellis became the last woman to be hanged in the UK., Chelsea won football’s First Division for the first time, and Newcastle United took the FA Cup for the sixth time, a trophy they have not won since., Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett had its English-language premiere and JRR Tolkien’s final Lord of the Rings book, The Return of the King, was published.uk road travel falls to 1955 levels as covid 19 lockdown takes hold coronavirus traffic", "label": 0}, "train-225": {"text": "\nBelfast shooting: three men arrested\n, Suspects questioned on Saturday in connection with murder of man outside house, \nHenry McDonald in Belfast, \nNazia Parveen, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 19.22 EDT\n\n\nFirst published on Sat 4 Apr 2020 09.32 EDT\n\n, Three men have been arrested in Belfast in connection with the murder of a man in the north of the city earlier on Saturday., The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the three suspects were taken to Musgrave Street police station in central Belfast for questioning on Saturday evening., The PSNI also said that the murdered man was shot several times during the gun attack in the Ardoyne district around 11.50am on Saturday., A councillor whose constituency includes the Ardoyne district where the fatal shooting occurred said a number of children were playing nearby when the man was shot dead., The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said there was no excuse for this “abhorrent and brutal crime”, adding that it was “particularly thoughtless at a time when our emergency services are already working increasingly hard to keep us all safe dealing with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic”., The victim was killed in the front garden of a house in Etna Drive in Ardoyne., Local sources said they did not believe the killing had a sectarian motive, and that the victim was not from the area., Paul McCusker, an SDLP councillor for north Belfast, said a number of people living in Etna Drive tried to save the victim after he was shot., “One man from Etna Drive tried to use CPR to revive him but to no avail while other neighbours in the street comforted him until the emergency services came,” he said., McCusker said it was deeply disturbing that young children playing in their front gardens while locked down at home due to the coronavirus crisis may have witnessed the shooting., “This brutal crime has caused immense shock in Ardoyne.

There is also no data at the moment suggesting an increased risk of miscarriage for pregnant women., The RCOG reiterates government advice that pregnant women “should pay particular attention to avoiding contact with people who are known to have Covid-19 or those who exhibit possible symptoms”., It adds: “Women above 28 weeks’ gestation should be particularly attentive to social distancing and minimising contact with others.”, Johnson and Symonds, a former director of communications for the Conservative party, announced in February that they were engaged to be married and were expecting a baby.carrie symonds recovering from coronavirus", "label": 0}, "train-227": {"text": "\nPrince Andrew will reportedly not be interviewed in Epstein documentary\n, Duke of York will not appear in upcoming Lifetime film on Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and sex offender, \nVictoria Bekiempis in New York, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 12.42 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Apr 2020 13.04 EDT\n\n, Prince Andrew will reportedly not agree to be interviewed for a forthcoming documentary about the financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein., The Duke of York has been repeatedly criticized for associating with Epstein, who died in custody in New York following his July 2019 arrest on sex trafficking charges., According to the Daily Mirror, Andrew was “formally asked” to appear in Surviving Jeffrey Epstein, a four-hour Lifetime production slated for release this summer to follow the channel’s similarly titled films about the singer R Kelly., The British paper quoted an unidentified Los Angeles-based source as saying: “Andrew has been asked to appear to discuss his friendship, but there has been no formal response.”, The reports come some four months after Andrew’s own disastrous BBC Newsnight interview, which was followed by his withdrawal from public duties and patronages., An Epstein accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, alleges that Epstein directed her to have sex with Andrew when she was 17., Andrew has categorically denied all claims of wrongdoing and maintains that he has “no recollection” of meeting Roberts Giuffre, although he was photographed with his arm around her., Andrew told Newsnight he could not have had sex with Roberts Giuffre because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking at the time of their alleged meeting, an alibi which was widely received with incredulity., The prince also claimed Giuffre Roberts’ allegations that he sweated profusely while dancing with her could not be true, as: “I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time … because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at.”, The Mirror quoted its source as saying Andrew’s “legal team have told him to conduct no more interviews after he spoke to the BBC”., “There is a concern anything he says on tape or camera becomes potential legal material for the many civil cases facing Epstein, and FBI questions regarding Andrew. Essentially all allegations that mention Andrew within the context of Epstein will be dealt with by his lawyers.”, On Saturday, Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment., In November, Andrew said he was “willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations if required”. But he has been accused of refusing to cooperate with US authorities investigating Epstein, who in 2008 pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution., “Contrary to Prince Andrew’s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options,” Manhattan US attorney Geoffrey Berman told reporters in March, revisiting a claim made in January., Buckingham Palace said then it would not comment and said “the issue is being dealt with by the Duke of York’s legal team”., Sources previously told the Guardian Andrew was “committed to the legal process”., A source was quoted as saying: “He is angry about the way this is being portrayed and bewildered as to why this was said in New York.”prince andrew reportedly not interviewed jeffrey epstein documentary", "label": 0}, "train-228": {"text": "\nFishermen face bleak year as pandemic bites\n, After three months of storms and high winds, a slump in demand has left most of the UK’s fleet tied up and facing ruin, \nHarriet Sherwood, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 11.35 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Apr 2020 12.06 EDT\n\n, The UK fishing sector has been badly hit by the coronavirus crisis, with the collapse of export markets and the shutdown of the hospitality industry leading to most boats being tied up., British fishermen export about 70% of their catch, mainly to continental Europe and Asia. The sharp fall in demand has been a “severe shock”, said Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations., “Like everyone, our members have been stunned by the magnitude of this crisis. It’s a very fluid and dynamic situation, and we’re hoping it’s temporary,” he said., Meanwhile, there are concerns that imports of fish, which amount to 70-80% of the seafood consumed in the UK, could be hampered by pressure on supply chains, including sickness and self-isolation among key workers., Last week, shipping representatives warned ministers that without government support, freight ships will be laid up, leading to a shortage of food and other goods. Frozen fish imports usually arrive in the UK on container ships., The first sign of the crisis in the UK fishing sector was a sudden slump in demand from Asia for shellfish. Deas said: “In recent years, there has been quite a dependence on the Chinese market for sales of crab, so that’s where it was felt first as exports dried up., “More recently, there has been the closure of the restaurant and hospitality trade, which has had a big impact on the shellfish trade. It has pretty well collapsed. White fish has been a bit more mixed, but there has certainly been a reduction in demand. The closure of some supermarket fish counters has not been helpful.”, Fish markets in the north-east of England, where catches are sold on to suppliers to restaurants, supermarkets and fishmongers, have closed and Peterhead – the largest market in Europe – has seen a significant fall in trade. Markets in the south-west of England are open but reporting a slump in prices., Jim Portus of the South Western Fish Producers’ Association said that producers of crabs, prawns and scallops were the “critical sectors that have no market at all now”., He added: “We were severely hampered in the first three months of the year by storms and high winds. There wasn’t much meat on the bones at the start of the coronavirus outbreak – fishermen tend to live hand to mouth – so this is pretty critical economically.”, The ongoing costs like harbour dues and equipment rental continue even if your boats are tied up,  Many trawlers were spending more time in port than usual, said Portus: “They’re maybe doing three days at sea, three days in port, rather than six days at sea and one day’s rest.”, There was a glimmer of recovery in the Chinese market, he said: “If countries like Italy, Spain and France start to come out of the coronavirus crisis several weeks ahead of the UK, there’s no reason why fishing vessels shouldn’t start ramping up – but it’s more likely to be a slow buildup than an overnight recovery., Industry representatives are in talks with the government about financial help for the sector. Most fishermen are self-employed and their income is a share of the profits rather than a set rate., “Most will come under the chancellor’s package for self-employed people, but some at the top and the bottom of the range may be excluded,” said Deas. “The ongoing costs, such as harbour dues and equipment rental, continue even if your boats are tied up. We’re making a case to the government for a bespoke package for the fishing sector.”, Johnny Murt, who owns a 25ft boat in Padstow, Cornwall, and supplies lobster and crab to local high-end restaurants and for export, said his market had vanished., “The lobsters are just starting to move. It’s the start of the season, coming off the back of a really hard winter. By the time we come out of this, we’ll be just about rolling into another winter. I think it will be a year from now before we start to earn any money, and some fishing businesses will crumble.”, In Mevagissey, a Cornish fishing village whose picturesque harbour is a big tourist draw, about a dozen boats out of 70 registered in the port were at sea last week., Celia Mitchell, secretary of the Mevagissey Fisherman’s Association, said: “We’ve just had the worst winter a lot of people can remember, and now this, just as better weather was coming. The harbour is losing a lot of income from both fishing and tourism. It’s looking like a bleak few months ahead.”fishermen face bleak year as pandemic bites", "label": 0}, "train-229": {"text": "\nGrouse shoots scrapped as heather burning is banned on moors\n, \nGrouse shoots scrapped as heather burning is banned on moors\n, Torching heather, popular with gamekeepers but bad for the environment, is now outlawed in several upland areas of northern England, \nJamie Doward, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 10.45 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Apr 2020 10.48 EDT\n\n, The controversial practice of setting heather-covered moorland on fire – often carried out by gamekeepers to create more attractive habitats for grouse – is now banned on more than 30 major tracts of land in northern England. Three large landowners have confirmed that their tenants are no longer allowed to burn heather routinely., The ban is a blow to grouse shoots, which burn older heather to make way for younger, more nutritious plants for grouse to feed on, but environmental groups say the practice harms the environment. Research by the University of Leeds has found that burning grouse moors degrades peatland habitat, releases climate-altering gases, reduces biodiversity and increases flood risk., Last year, the Observer reported that Yorkshire Water was reviewing each of its grouse-shooting leases amid concerns about the practice of routine burning. The company says has written into its lease a presumption against burning as a land management technique., United Utilities is also altering its leases to shorter terms, with a similar review to Yorkshire Water’s expected. Last month, it confirmed to the campaign group Ban Bloodsports on Yorkshire’s Moors (BBYM) that it now prohibits routine burning on its land., Yorkshire Water, United Utilities and the National Trust are to be commended for ending routine burning of moorland, And three estates overseen by the National Trust – Marsden, Braithwaite Hall and Dark Peak – also told the group that tenants were no longer allowed to conduct routine burning. Braithwaite Hall said tenants required written consent to do so, and that it had taken legal action against one. Dark Peak said it retained complete control of burning practices on its land. Marsden said tenants could not carry out any burning., A National Trust spokeswoman said: “We don’t allow burning on deep peat and over recent years have moved away from using controlled grouse-moor burning as a matter of course. There are a diminishing number of historic agreements where burning may occasionally be used but we are working with these tenants to introduce more sustainable land-management practice.”, Routine burning is now no longer allowed on 34 sections of moorland spanning Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire, according to BBYM. “Yorkshire Water, United Utilities and the National Trust are to be commended for ending routine burning of moorland,” said Luke Steele of BBYM., Steele said there had been 550 incidents of grouse-moor burning recorded across Yorkshire since the burning season began in October. , The environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, has promised to stop the practice. And the committee on climate change has recommended that a grouse-moor burning ban be introduced within the year. But owners of large grouse moors have threatened legal action if such a ban is introduced., The issue has been thrown into sharp relief by the coronavirus outbreak. Yorkshire Water and United Utilities have said that all burning on their land must now cease until further notice. The National Trust said: “We are keen to alleviate pressure on the emergency services, and are working with estate managers and tenants to ensure any burning is stopped immediately.”, The move follows requests from emergency services and local councils, which fear that burning increases the risk of wildfires, and that fumes might affect people suffering from Covid-19.grouse shoots scrapped as heather burning is banned on moors", "label": 0}, "train-230": {"text": "\nKeeping up with the Sussexes: will Harry and Meghan be LA’s hottest ticket?\n, \nKeeping up with the Sussexes: will Harry and Meghan be LA’s hottest ticket?\n, The royal couple are tipped to be the toast of the celebrity circuit but they will have to work hard to maintain their A-list status , \nMiranda Bryant, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 10.05 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Apr 2020 13.17 EDT\n\n, Touching down to a city in lockdown cannot have been what the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had in mind when they had imagined starting a new life in Los Angeles. With a stay-at-home order in place, all activities usually associated with the city – premieres, parties, events and schmoozing – were on hold when they reportedly arrived last month, and studios had stopped production., Following months of drama swirling around Harry and Meghan’s decision to step down as working royals, which officially came into force on Wednesday, in the face of a deadly global pandemic they have finally taken a backseat in the public consciousness., Reports of their sudden arrival in Meghan’s hometown from Canada, just before the US closed its border amid the coronavirus outbreak, were greeted with subdued surprise. They had been living on Vancouver Island with their 10-month-old son Archie since their shock announcement in January that they were leaving in search of a “more peaceful life”., Donald Trump made time to greet them – via Twitter of course – in trademark style. “The US will not pay for their security protection,” he wrote. “They must pay!” They do not appear to be cowed by the president’s welcome note, issuing a swift rebuttal to Trump, saying they had “no plans to ask the US government for security resources”, adding: “Privately funded security arrangements have been made.”, According to their final Instagram post under their former identities – they will no longer use the term “Sussex Royal” – they are “focusing this new chapter to understand how we can best contribute”., Clearly major changes are already under way. As they parted ways with Buckingham Palace, they also wasted no time in announcing the appointment of new chief of staff Catherine St-Laurent, who previously worked for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. , So what lies in store for the couple? And when life in the city begins to return to normal – assuming it will – what might their day-to-day lives look like?, Melanie Bromley, chief news correspondent and head of news operations for E!, says: “As much as they both have – Meghan especially – some roots in Canada, LA is her home. It is where she grew up, it’s the place that she knows best, and so it isn’t a surprise that they’re here. I think what has surprised people is just the fact that they came here so quickly.” ,  As soon as the city kicks back into business again, the couple are expected to shoot to the top of everybody’s invite lists. “Ultimately, this is a city where royalty trumps celebrity,” says LA-based Bromley. “They are potentially the most famous residents of Los Angeles – or at least they’re on the same level as Oprah Winfrey, as that kind of celebrity, AAA list.”, The couple are currently living in a “secluded compound”, according to People. Meghan, a self-professed “Cali girl”, grew up in LA in Woodland Hills, and her mother, Doria Ragland, lives in the city. But Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, are reportedly house-hunting in the ocean-facing celebrity hotspot of Malibu., To get a sense of the scale of their intentions, Bromley says look no further than the appointment of St-Laurent., “That’s a huge hire of somebody who knows the foundation world, who has relevance in that industry, who’s a real heavy hitter – and that hire alone tells me how serious Meghan and Harry are when it comes to what their new life will look like,” she says., While they have yet to provide details on what form their charity might take, causes are likely to include mental health, the environment and the climate crisis, gender equality and women and girls’ rights., And what about work? Under their new plan, they will no longer rely on taxpayer funding and will instead earn their own income., Meghan’s first gig, doing the voiceover for Disneynature documentary Elephant, released on streaming platform Disney+ on Friday, was met with generally warm reviews. But it won’t earn her money because she donated her fee to conservation charity Elephants Without Borders., However, the documentary will be an interesting test of her “bankability” as a star, says LA Times entertainment industry reporter Anousha Sakoui. “Disney will get the first insight into the sellability of their name when it comes to content. Immediately, that has got some profile.” While royalty “has a mystique that sells’, she says that “the popularity is what’s important to studios. They are money-making organisations”.,  Ted Sarandos, Netflix chief content officer, has voiced his interest in working with the couple, and last year Prince Harry announced he had teamed up with Winfrey for a documentary series on mental health for Apple TV+., Sakoui warns, however, that everybody in LA has a lifespan and has to work for attention – even A-list celebrities and royalty. “There’s a lot of people competing for attention, and they will have to compete for them as well. But they have great connections.”, Joe Bel Bruno, editor-in-chief of website dot.LA, believes that once the city reopens for business, the couple will be sought after for every Hollywood and charity function., “We already have a lot of celebrities, and we have multibillionaires who live here from the business world who like to entertain and like to throw these sort of events, and they will be No 1 on the list. Everyone will be clamouring to get them because we don’t have royals here, so this elevates the scene a bit.”, The proliferation of wealth in LA also makes it an ideal place to fundraise. “It’s the perfect place for them building a foundation. And then on top of that, Meghan is able to pursue her Hollywood career, and she will be sought after just for her name and status,” he says., Meanwhile, he thinks that a lot of businesses – such as Snapchat, based in Santa Monica – and charities will be interested in working with Harry. “There are companies based here that would welcome him to be on their boards, just as status.”, Mindy Weiss, party consultant to the stars, says when the Sussexes are not working with charities, she can see Meghan as a fan of Goop – Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle brand, also based in Santa Monica – and Harry playing polo. , But security will be essential, she says, as the paparazzi are “aggressive”. “The paps will love them, and it will be crazy at the beginning – but, just like anything and any celebrity, eventually they become part of the community and it just becomes a normalcy in La La Land.”, Phil Lobel, whose Hollywood PR company Lobeline Communications lists Brad Pitt among its previous clients, says Harry and Meghan will be “the new it couple” and can see them supporting numerous charities in the southern California area., The couple have enlisted the services of PR firm Sunshine Sachs, whose clients include Ben Affleck and Leonardo DiCaprio., But in terms of their brand, Jeetendr Sehdev, LA celebrity branding expert and author of US bestselling book The Kim Kardashian Principle , believes they will not follow any preordained rules, and that their “disruptive” approach especially appeals to Generation Z., “The Meghan and Harry brand has always been very disruptive. They’re going to show us all a different way in which royal family members can live,” he says., He sees their prime revenue stream as being their charity – a “forward-thinking woke charitable foundation” – book endorsements and other endorsements, speaking engagements, and from “Harry opening up about his life as a royal family member”., “The closest comparison to Meghan and Harry will be the Obamas and what they’re actually doing, I mean they’ve created an entertainment entity where they’re producing documentaries and I think that will be a similar route that Meghan and Harry can certainly take.”, But, he says, Meghan is a more “natural fit” in their new surroundings than Harry, whose brand is going to take a little more work. While he doesn’t think they should model themselves on existing LA royalty, the Kardashians, he does think they need to follow their example when it comes to opening up. “Letting people into who they are – because at the moment we don’t really know who Meghan and Harry are. We just know that they’re part of the royal family.”So, will they get the peaceful life they were hoping for? “I don’t believe Meghan and Harry are moving out to Los Angeles for a peaceful life,” said Sehdev. “I think they’re moving here for a particular type of lifestyle.”keeping up with the sussexes will harry and meghan be las hottest ticket", "label": 0}, "train-231": {"text": "\nUK phone masts attacked amid 5G-coronavirus conspiracy theory\n, Police investigate possible arson attacks as officials and experts reject rumours that 5G causes Covid-19, \nNazia Parveen and \nJim Waterson, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 08.20 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Apr 2020 14.49 EDT\n\n, Three recent mobile phone mast fires around the UK are being investigated as possible arson, amid concerns that people are attacking telecoms infrastructure because of a conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the spread of coronavirus., The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, also revealed he had received threats relating to the “bizarre” theory, which has gained traction on social media., On Friday, emergency services were called to reports that a 5G mast was on fire in Liverpool shortly before 11pm. Police confirmed they were investigating the blaze at Spencer’s Lane, Aintree, close to the M57 motorway., Fire crews managed to get the fire under control quickly and were photographed parked outside the field shortly after it was extinguished., The media regulator, Ofcom, said on Thursday it was monitoring broadcasters who spread the discredited conspiracy theory, although coverage has spread more widely on social networks, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Nextdoor., Speaking at Saturday’s Downing Street press conference, cabinet secretary Michael Gove said the theories were “dangerous nonsense”. Professor Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England, condemned them as “the worst kind of fake news”., “I’m absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency,” he said. “It is absolute and utter rubbish.” , Just hours before the reported incident in Liverpool, Anderson dismissed the theories as “bizarre”. He said he was amazed by the amount of traction the conspiracy was getting on social media, and that all scientific and government advice showed the technology posed no harm to people., Speaking to the Guardian, the mayor revealed he had received threats relating to the theory and had reported them to Merseyside police., “The suggestion that Covid-19 is somehow linked to 5G is patently beyond the realms of credibility – utterly bizarre,” he said., “In Liverpool these masts are being upgraded and ironically the very people that are using this technology are the ones who are believing these theories. I was mildly threatened yesterday by someone telling me to take them down., “The reality is there is huge pressure on the network at the moment with so many people at home and that’s why engineers are upgrading it. The idea that I have entered into some kind of machiavellian plot with the government is ridiculous.”, Social media posts from celebrities, such as the singer Anne-Marie, have helped spread the theory, while Amanda Holden, a judge on Britain’s Got Talent, shared a link to an online petition promoting the false rumour that the symptoms of coronavirus are caused by residing near a 5G mast. The petition was removed following inquiries from the Guardian., Cheers actor Woody Harrelson and former Dancing on Ice judge Jason Gardiner are also among stars who have shared theories., The government is increasingly concerned about the impact of the spread of such false theories., A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, which has responsibility for telecoms policy, warned people to stop damaging key infrastructure during a national emergency: “These are baseless theories, there is absolutely no credible evidence of a link between 5G and coronavirus. Threats or violence towards any key worker or damage to mobile phone masts will not be tolerated.”, On Thursday, police in Belfast appealed for information after a mobile phone mast was damaged in an arson attack, with online footage suggesting the motive was opposition to 5G networks., The video clip shows an incident on the Antrim Road in north Belfast on Thursday night, in which flames can be seen at the base of a mobile telephone mast., According to a report in the Irish News, voices can be heard stating “Fuck the 5G” and “Viva la revolution” as the fire burns., Facebook removed one anti-5G group in which members were being encouraged to supply footage of them destroying mobile phone equipment. Video footage of a 70ft (20m) telephone mast on fire in Birmingham this week has also circulated widely alongside claims it was targeted by anti-5G protesters., The problem has become so bad that engineers working for Openreach, which provides home broadband services, have posted pleas on anti-5G Facebook groups, asking to be spared from on-street abuse as they are not involved in maintaining mobile networks., The industry lobby group Mobile UK said the incidents were affecting efforts to maintain networks that were supporting home working and providing critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals. Telecoms engineers are considered key workers under the government’s guidelines., International radiation experts have repeatedly made clear that the new high-speed telephone system does not pose a risk to humans, while pointing out that the coronavirus has spread widely in many countries without any 5G coverage, such as Iran.uk phone masts attacked amid 5g coronavirus conspiracy theory", "label": 0}, "train-232": {"text": "\nSuspected coronavirus outbreak at Glasgow care home after 13 die\n, Deceased had not been diagnosed with Covid-19 although two staff members have tested positive, \nAaron Walawalkar, \n\nSat 4 Apr 2020 08.04 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Apr 2020 09.57 EDT\n\n, Thirteen people have died in the space of a week after a suspected coronavirus outbreak at a Glasgow care home., Two staff members at the Burlington Court care home, where all victim’s lived, are being treated in separate hospitals after testing positive for Covid-19., The residents all had underlying health conditions and it is not yet confirmed whether they had died from the disease as tests are carried out upon hospital admission only., A spokeswoman for Four Seasons Health Care, which runs Burlington Court, said it had “strict protocols on infectious diseases” and that it was closely monitoring the health of the other residents and colleagues., She added: “Our condolences are with their families and we are providing them with our ongoing support during this difficult time.”, The spokeswoman said the home had had access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and the GPs had provided support through visits and telephone contact., The team have been liaising with Public Health Scotland as well as the Care Inspectorate which are fully up to date, she added., The Care Inspectorate confirmed it was aware of the deaths at Burlington Court as a result of a suspected Covid-19 outbreak., “Our thoughts are with the loved ones of those affected as well as the the staff and wider community of the home,” a spokesman said. “We have been notified of the circumstances and we are in contact with the care service and the local health and social care partnership during this difficult time., “All of Scotland’s social care sector is working under very difficult circumstances to care for people during the pandemic and the Care Inspectorate is doing all it can to support them.”suspected coronavirus outbreak at glasgow care home after 13 die", "label": 0}, "train-233": {"text": "\nScotland's chief medical officer quits over second home row\n, Catherine Calderwood steps down after visiting second home twice despite advice to stay in, \nSeverin Carrell Scotland editor, \n\nSun 5 Apr 2020 18.31 EDT\n\n\nFirst published on Sun 5 Apr 2020 03.56 EDT\n\n, Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, has quit after facing intense criticism for breaking her own rules to twice visit her second home during the coronavirus outbreak., In a statement issued on Sunday night, more than seven hours after insisting she would carry on, Calderwood said she had again discussed the controversy with Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon and concluded her position was untenable., She said she realised it was impossible for the public to have confidence in official advice to avoid all essential travel if she remained in post: “People across Scotland know what they need to do to reduce the spread of this virus and that means they must have complete trust in those who give them advice. It is with a heavy heart that I resign as chief medical officer.”, Calderwood’s resignation follows mounting criticism from opposition leaders, members of the public and villagers in Earlsferry, Fife, where she and her husband have a second home., The Scottish Sun revealed on Saturday that the Calderwoods and their three children had spent Friday night at their holiday home, taking walks with their dog to a local beach. Initially, the Scottish government had claimed she had visited the seaside home to “check on it”., She also revealed that despite being the voice of the Scottish government’s public information campaign urging people to avoid all non-essential travel, she and her husband had visited Earlsferry the previous weekend – something she and the government did not disclose until Sunday afternoon., Hours after insisting at her daily coronavirus briefing that she needed Calderwood at her side to give her expert advice on the crisis, Sturgeon said she now agreed the controversy was damaging the government’s message., “It is clear that the mistake she made – even though she has apologised sincerely and honourably for it – risks distracting from and undermining confidence in the government’s public health message at this crucial time. That is not a risk either of us is willing to take.”, Four hours before announcing her resignation, Sturgeon had announced that Calderwood was stepping back from all public campaigning on the outbreak, including the Scottish government public information film urging people to stay at home which was still being broadcast on Sunday., That failed to satisfy opposition parties. Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, said the Scottish government had not been candid about the Calderwoods’ behaviour or her culpability., “It is clear that the chief medical officer’s disregard of the government’s own guidelines which she is the principal adviser on, was not a one-off, a simple mistake, or human error as was suggested overnight,” Leonard said., “The CMO needs to step down, not step back. The Scottish government’s handling of this has been less than straight. Unless the government is honest and open, it is running the serious risk of causing public confidence to collapse. This is in no-one’s interest at a time of national crisis.”, With opposition parties and members of the public calling on Calderwood to quit, Police Scotland’s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, said his officers had given Calderwood a formal warning about her conduct after visiting her home on Sunday., In an intervention designed to shore up public confidence in the lockdown, Livingstone used his force’s Twitter feed to chastise Calderwood., “The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone,” he said. “Individuals must not make personal exemptions bespoke to their own circumstances.”, Earlier on Sunday, Sturgeon was asked several times whether Calderwood had tendered her resignation after her visits came to light, but refused to answer those questions directly. Instead, she hinted Calderwood had offered to quit but she had refused to allow it., “Whatever her reasons for doing so, she was wrong, and she knows that,” Sturgeon said, adding that Calderwood had given her an unreserved apology., “If I’m to do what I need to do, to steer this country through the crisis to the very best of my ability I need her to be able to focus on the job she is doing,” Sturgeon said. “A job that – notwithstanding her mistake on this – she is doing extremely well.”, In a clear signal Sturgeon planned to defend her, Calderwood stood alongside the first minister during the briefing, being broadcast live online. Calderwood said she was “truly sorry” for breaching her own advice not to travel, and acknowledged NHS staff had attacked her conduct., As the controversy intensified during the day on Sunday, a Scottish government advert featuring Calderwood’s warnings against all unjustified travel was still being broadcast, in which she said: “This is a vital update about coronavirus. To help save lives, stay at home. Anyone can spread coronavirus.”, Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader and MSP, said residents in the picturesque village were furious about an influx of second-home owners arriving there over the weekend. Backed by Scottish Labour, he said Calderwood’s actions would weaken public confidence in the lockdown., Sturgeon deflected questions about the candour of her government’s first statements defending the chief medical officer’s actions, and fielded questions that reporters had put to Calderwood., On Saturday, the Scottish government said Calderwood had been working “seven days a week” and “she took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fife as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over”., That statement failed to explain why the whole family needed to go or stay overnight.

The problem, Murphy said, was that there was a lack of sanitising wipes that drivers could use both in the garage and out on journeys with the public., “Unite, working with Transport for London and the bus companies, have managed to secure plenty of hand gel – but what we are waiting for are the sanitising wipes,” he said. “There appears to be a big shortage of wipes and they are needed. I understand that because production is dramatically down and factories are closing there is a real shortage, but we are calling on Transport for London to seek a new source for them as soon as possible.”, The former bus driver stressed that every bus on London’s streets and roads was now deep cleaned overnight before it left the garage, but said he was calling on both TfL and the bus companies to allow Unite shop stewards access to any deep clean that took place, if members requested it, to reassure bus workers that the vehicles had been properly cleaned., Murphy said the installation of protective Perspex booths was “still on a rolling basis” and not all buses on the road were fitted with them., “Given that the fleet is running on reduced services, perhaps Transport for London could fit the buses not in use with the booths so that drivers on every route still operating will be behind Perspex as soon as possible,” he added., Dr John Ashton, a public health expert who is currently advising the Bahraini government on its response to the Covid-19 crisis, said it was essential that bus drivers wear masks as well as working behind protective screens., The former regional director of public health in Northwest England said: “Really the bus drivers and indeed public transport workers should be afforded the same protection as NHS staff. That means they should be given face masks and all should be tested for the virus. This is so obvious. They are public servants working day in day out with the public and they need everything at their disposal to protect themselves and those they come into contact with.”, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said he was “absolutely devastated” by the news of the bus workers’ deaths. He promised to bring in further measures to ensure higher levels of protection across the London transport system., Khan said: “I have been clear that our incredible public transport staff, on the buses, tubes, trams and trains, are critical workers, making a heroic effort to allow our NHS staff to save more lives., “But we all need to play our part too, and that means fewer Londoners using the public transport network.”coronavirus london mayor devastated deaths bus workers", "label": 0}, "train-235": {"text": "Scottish fruit farmers recruit thousands of locals to save harvest, Students and laid-off bar and restaurant workers given jobs as pickers after urgent appeal , Scottish fruit farmers have solved a recruitment crisis that could have resulted in this year’s harvest of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries being destroyed., Several thousand people, including students and restaurant and bar workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak, have taken low-paid fruit-picking jobs in Tayside and Fife normally done by seasonal workers from Bulgaria and Romania., Farmers across the UK have said fruit and vegetable harvests are threatened by lockdown measures that have prevented tens of thousands of workers from flying in from eastern Europe for the picking season., Recruitment agencies have proposed chartering special flights to bring in workers from the continent, but in Tayside most vacancies have been filled by locals after an urgent appeal from farmers to fill 3,200 vacancies., James Porter, a fruit farmer who helps run Angus Growers, an organisation with members in Angus, Perthshire and Fife, said most of the 19 farms that took part in the appeal had filled all their vacancies. , “We’ve had a big response,” he said. “It’s very encouraging and it gives me a bit of hope we might still be harvesting our crops.” Many were students whose university courses had stopped and who normally had summer jobs., Porter said Scottish farms produced about 25% of the UK’s soft fruit each year. Angus Growers members produced 12,400 tons of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries last year., Picking for the first crops would start in two weeks, Porter said, and picking for berries grown in heated tunnels had already begun. Picking would accelerate in May and peak from June onwards., He said fruit picking was a skilled and demanding job, requiring speed, dexterity and knowledge about which fruit to pick. Migrant workers had been doing this work for 10 to 15 years, he said, and were extremely fast., New recruits also needed to learn how to work safely with machinery and equipment, and maintain physical distancing while picking to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus., He said it would take time and training for recruits to develop the skills his normal workforce had, and it was unclear whether the people who had signed up for this season’s harvest would turn up or stay on if they found the job too demanding., Local recruits may also leave if their old jobs return and universities resume teaching once the lockdown is relaxed, he added. “A lot of things have to line up and work this summer.

The suggestion made by a source was specific: a bed was being prepared at St Thomas’ hospital for the prime minister, whose condition had worsened during his seven-day period of isolation in Downing Street., It did not take long for rumours to spread. A Conservative backbencher had heard a similar story, this time suggesting Johnson may have even already been admitted to the hospital across the Thames from Westminster, and passed the tip to the Guardian at about the same time. Together it was more than enough to prompt an urgent inquiry to No 10., In reply, Johnson’s aides were emphatic. His condition had not deteriorated, he still had only “mild symptoms”, he hoped to be at work from Friday when his coronavirus isolation period was up - and he had not been admitted to St Thomas’ hospital for treatment. When on Monday evening it emerged that contrary to reassurances about him getting on with his red box, he was being admitted to intensive care, the denials were coming under increasing scrutiny., Johnson, 55, had spent the week since testing positive for coronavirus holed up in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, while his pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds - who has herself been unwell - was becoming increasingly concerned about his health., The prime minister hoped to keep his period of isolation to a minimum, trying to govern the country via video conference calls and email, all the while still coughing and with his overall condition failing to improve., Meanwhile, the mood in Downing Street was darkening during a difficult week in which it was becoming clear that the government was struggling to hit a target of 10,000 coronavirus tests a day, even prompting the unwell prime minister on Wednesday to promise that he would take personal charge of the issue., Key advisers such as Dominic Cummings, his chief aide, were not at No 10 because they too were ill and isolating, while criticism was being levelled at the health secretary, Matt Hancock, himself only back at work on Thursday after developing symptoms., “Other ministers feel he’s been getting the government in trouble by over-promising on testing, and not interrogating his civil servants enough,” according to one well-connected Tory aide, who is close to key figures at No 10., There was also criticism of the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, the leading figure in Downing Street in Johnson’s and Cummings’s absence. “Sedwill seems to be amassing power, even though you have to be questioning how effective the civil service has been in tackling coronavirus so far. And all the while, was he looking out properly for the prime minister?” the aide added, although it is hard to know if even the country’s most senior official could have persuaded Johnson to recuperate earlier., On Thursday lunchtime, having denied the first round of rumours about St Thomas’, Downing Street floated the idea that Johnson might not be back at work on Friday as planned if his temperature remained high., A cough was not mentioned, but his official spokesman told a daily briefing with journalists that he would only go back to work the next day if his temperature came down., That evening at 8pm, despite his isolation, the prime minister appeared at the door of No 10 to applaud the work of NHS workers. Despite the appearance, the health rumours did not go away: St Thomas’ was on standby because Johnson’s condition had worsened, the first source insisted - only for Downing Street, when pressed, to deny that he was about to be admitted that night., On Friday lunchtime, the situation began to unravel. An unkempt, gravelly-voiced and clearly unwell Johnson released a video in which he said, somewhat implausibly, “I’m feeling better,” before conceding he could not fully return to work. “Alas, I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,” he insisted., On Saturday he spoke to newly elected Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to invite him “to a briefing next week” on the crisis, but on Sunday his health apparently took a turn. At about 7.30pm that evening, Johnson was rushed by car to the hospital., About 90 minutes later, Downing Street went public, saying Johnson had been “admitted to hospital for tests” on the advice of his doctor and, in a change of language, acknowledged the prime minister was suffering from “persistent” rather than mild symptoms., Shortly before 8.30pm on Monday, further news came: the prime minister had been admitted to intensive care at St Thomas’ 90 minutes earlier., Several sources say Johnson has required oxygen to help with his breathing following his admission to hospital - an assertion that was not denied by Downing Street - although his official spokesman said that Russian reports that he was on a ventilator were “disinformation”. Those who know Symonds, 32, say she is worried: “She’s ringing up friends, telling them how anxious she is.”, At the daily press briefing on Monday evening, nearly 24 hours after Johnson’s admission to hospital, little extra detail was offered., Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who has now taken over temporarily with Johnson incapacitated, would only repeat that the prime minister “had a comfortable night” and was “in good spirits”., Some Conservative MPs are worried that Downing Street’s evasiveness on the seriousness of the prime minister’s condition will undermine trust in what they say going forward.the strange lead up to boris johnsons admission to hospital", "label": 0}, "train-239": {"text": "\nNicola Sturgeon reveals she asked chief medical officer to resign\n, Catherine Calderwood’s breach of lockdown harmed public confidence, says first minister, \nSeverin Carrell Scotland editor, \n\nMon 6 Apr 2020 14.03 EDT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 7 Apr 2020 10.45 EDT\n\n, Nicola Sturgeon has disclosed she asked Scotland’s chief medical officer to resign on Sunday night after realising her breaches of lockdown regulations were damaging public confidence., The first minister told reporters on Monday she reversed her earlier decision to publicly defend Catherine Calderwood after it became clear later on Sunday that the CMO’s position was untenable., It is understood Calderwood, an obstetrician, could face an investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC), the medical profession’s regulator, for potentially breaching its codes of conduct., Part 75 of the GMC’s good practice code requires doctors to immediately report any incident where they are cautioned or charged by the police. There is no equivalent of a caution under Scottish law, but the chief constable of Police Scotland, Iain Livingstone, disclosed on Sunday that his officers had visited her at home and issued her with a warning about breaching the lockdown. The Times reported that her husband, Angus Loudon, was also given a warning., Part 65 of the code says doctors must “act with honesty and integrity”, and “must make sure your conduct justifies your patients’ trust in your and the public’s trust in the profession”., Calderwood apologised on Sunday after admitting that the couple had twice visited their holiday home in Earlsferry, Fife, during the lockdown and had taken their family and gone for an overnight stay last Friday night, visiting the local beach., Calderwood has been approached for comment. The GMC would not confirm whether any complaints had been made about her conduct., Sturgeon denied news management was a factor in the timing of the resignation announcement, which came on Sunday night just as it emerged that Boris Johnson had been hospitalised with Covid-19. She said she and Calderwood agreed the CMO should quit after a long conversation to discuss their options., “What was at the forefront of my mind was how firstly I continue to make sure I have the best advice to enable me to deal with this virus, but also how I ensured that the confidence of the public in the advice we are giving then was maintained,” Sturgeon said., “Those were things I was weighing up during the day and as you know, I came to a view last night that the CMO had to resign in order to make sure we maintained that confidence.”, Calderwood’s resignation capped a difficult day for Sturgeon and the Scottish government, after the Scottish Sun published photographs of the CMO and her family breaching the lockdown she had been instructing the public to follow in the government’s information films., The first minister had insisted during her daily coronavirus briefing at 2pm on Sunday that Calderwood could not and should not quit because her expertise was essential to her; Sturgeon hinted the CMO had offered to resign, but she had rejected it., At 4.40pm Sturgeon announced via press release Calderwood would stand back from all public-facing work on the epidemic. At 9.54pm, the Scottish government announced she had quit., Sturgeon said on Monday she had seen emails and tweets from the public on Sunday evening that made clear allowing Calderwood to remain in office put the lockdown policy at risk. “That’s not a risk that I, and to be fair to her, she was prepared to take,” the first minister said., Sturgeon said Calderwood had not told the Scottish government she and her husband had made two visits to Earlsferry during the lockdown on Saturday, when the government was first asked for comment by the Scottish Sun., That government statement claimed she had visited to “check on” the property. “The statement which went out was a reflection of our understanding at that time of the reasons for her visit that weekend,” Sturgeon said. “She later made clear that there had been a second visit and of course made that clear at the briefing yesterday, so that’s the situation there.”, • This article was amended on 7 April 2020 to remove a reference to Catherine Calderwood being a “member” of the GMC.

Quite often the police are the agency who are trying to deal with that situation.”, He added: “One of the difficulties we’ve got as a police service is we’re losing staff to abstractions through self-isolation or sickness, so are the mental health services, so are social services, and it’s going to be all too easy for some of these people in real crisis to fall through the gaps as we see those staffing levels come under more burden, and it’s something we can’t lose sight of., “At the moment we are coping but we’re starting to see in some areas, particularly in specialist areas, that burden starting to rise as we lose staff.”, Ch Supt Paul Griffiths, the president of the Police Superintendents’ Association, told the committee that police officers were reporting an increase in mental health incidents., “We’re still waiting to see the data on the mental health incidents which we will still be dealing with, but anecdotally from our members we’re starting to see a slight increase, and if we continue to keep these isolating strategies in place there is a risk that mental health issues will increase over the coming weeks and months,” he said., “We’re well versed with what our role is in terms of supporting members of the community in terms of their mental health challenges, working with other agencies such as health and social care and local authorities. It’s a well trodden in terms of what we can do to maximise support for those individuals who are probably going to see increased and more intense pressure in terms of their wellbeing.”, Griffiths told the committee there was currently an absentee rate across the police estate of 13%. The total workforce as of September last year, the most recently available official statistics, was 205,000. Thirteen per cent would therefore equate to around 26,650 staff., Answering questions from Tim Loughton, Griffiths said no forces were yet reporting a risk to service provision., He said: “The absence rate is approximately 13% across the whole of the national establishment – that includes police officers and staff. Some of those will be sick, some of them will be self-isolating with symptoms, some of them will have caring responsibilities., “Even with that capacity issue, none of the police forces are flagging up anything they can’t cope with at this stage.”, • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

But a spokesperson for Public Health England (PHE), which leads on significant outbreaks, said the organisation did not call upon environmental health workers to carry out contact tracing for coronavirus, instead using its own local health protection teams., According to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health the UK has, at a conservative estimate, 5,000 environmental health officers working in local councils nationwide., The institute’s Northern Ireland director, Gary McFarlane, said government health bodies “absolutely should be drawing on the skills set of EHOs environmental health officers and if they aren’t, it’s a missed opportunity”. He said: “There is significant capacity that is sitting there for this kind of work to be done.”, PHE’s contact tracing response team was boosted to just under 300 staff, deemed adequate for the containment phase of handling the Covid-19 virus up to mid-March. In that time the team, working around the clock, traced 3,500 people and supported the 3% of contacts found to be infected to self-isolate. Tracing was scaled back when the UK moved to the delay phase of tackling coronavirus in mid-March. It is now carried out in limited form, mainly for vulnerable communities., An environmental health worker for a council in Scotland, who does not want to be named, said: “If councils had been given the go-ahead from the start, they could have put plans in place and now have a much flatter curve.” Another, with decades of experience, said he was “struggling to figure out” why this was not the case., One environmental health worker for a north-western council said his team were expecting a call at the start of the coronavirus outbreak. He said: “We are pretty good at infection control and contact tracing, it’s part of the job. We thought we’d be asked and were shelving other work.”, Environmental health workers have recently been tasked with ensuring the public stick to social distancing rules. They have also been monitoring takeaways and food deliveries. Environment health departments have, like other areas of local government, suffered austerity cuts since 2010., Contact tracing involves getting in touch with everyone an infected person might have seen and asking them to self-isolate in an effort to contain the virus., The government decision to all but abandon contact tracing is not consistent with WHO guidelines, which urge a test-and-trace approach. At a WHO media briefing on Covid-19 in March, director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “Tracing every contact must be the backbone of the response in every country.”, The approach has been carried out in other countries, including Ireland, Germany, South Korea and Singapore. In Germany, thousands of contact tracers are still working – with more being recruited – in part clearing a backlog of infections that occurred before the nation’s shutdown measures, according to Dr Philipp Zanger , head of the Institute of Hygiene, Infection Control and Prevention at the Rhineland-Palatinate agency for consumer and public protection., Contact tracing is also used to prepare to tackle any outbreaks when the lockdown is eased, since “once we let ourselves out again, we will see more transmission again,” he said., The UK government approach is understood to be that once virus infection numbers have tipped, manual contact tracing is unworkable, while social distancing and self-isolation measures reproduce much of its effect., But Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London, said giving up on it was a mistake. “You still need to do it,” he said, highlighting regions where infection numbers were relatively small. “In low-intensity areas you could ramp up your testing … use all your people to jump on it.”, Environmental health officers say that as well as helping to slow the spread of a virus, tracing could provide information on how it spreads and, if successful in containing outbreaks in specific areas, could help direct healthcare resources., The UK, US and Germany are developing smartphone apps to help trace coronavirus infections to ease national lockdowns. Versions of this technology have been used in South Korea and Singapore. Initial reports suggest the UK app would operate on a voluntary basis, while there are privacy concerns around the security of health and location data provided., A PHE spokesperson said that contact tracing was no longer useful because “with such a level of sustained community transmission there is limited value in doing so”.uk missed coronavirus contact tracing opportunity experts say", "label": 0}}
